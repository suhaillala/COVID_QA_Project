"I've gone sale agreed (note: ""sale agreed"" means the sale has been agreed in principle - no contracts have been signed, no non-refundable deposits have been made etc.) on a house. The market I'm currently in was extremely competitive, houses were all generally going for significantly more than their asking price, as mine did.

I have nearly everything ready - loan arranged, survey of the house completed, solicitor ready to sign everything.

Now with Covid, a recession is more than likely coming our way.

Furthermore, with lock-downs in place - the seller is extremely unlikely to find an alternative buyer in the near future (it's an executor sale if that makes any difference).

I was thinking of trying to put some pressure onto the seller to lower the agreed price.

While I don't want to lose the house (and the money we have spent so far on legal etc.), I would also like to take advantage of potentially lower mortgage repayments.

Is it a bad idea to put this to the estate agent and be forthright about exactly why I'm asking to lower the price? Is there a ""reasonable"" amount to lower the purchase price by?

Edit

My intention here isn't to ""screw"" the seller as several commentators assume that I am trying to do.

At the end of the day, I'm a first time buyer who has effectively agreed to buy a house at ""peak"" economic health. Within a couple of weeks of this agreement, economic impacts of covid-19 were already being felt and the short / medium term prospects are not good.

At the end of this year, if covid hasn't wreaked enough havoc, there is a very real risk that Brexit could have an extremely negative impact on my country.

So while the honorable thing to do might be to commit to the agreed purchase price, this might be an extremely unwise decision from a personal finance point of view.

""Why don't you just pull out of the sale then?"" 

I could do that, that leaves the seller in a very bad position as well - it will be extremely unlikely they will be able to find another buyer in the short / medium term - so giving them an opportunity to consider my concerns might be better than simply walking away.
","you could ask, but you risk the seller deciding to just cancel and put the property back on the market once restrictions lift, shutting you out. depending on the exact neighborhood and local market, there is no guarantee that a recession will even affect the chosen neighborhood. you described it as a very competitive, presumably it will still be a desirable neighborhood even in a recession and you did not mention how vulnerable the local economy is to a recession.

"How do bats survive their own coronaviruses (without showing any symptoms)?

Or, more generically, how can viruses keep reproducing inside healthy carriers without inducing any pathogenic effect?

Are coronaviruses able to replicate themselves without harming bats, or maybe these viruses are just latent like herpesviruses in humans?



Related question: Why are bats the source of dangerous coronavirus pandemics?
","it is common for the reservoir host of a zoonotic virus to be tolerant of it. mers coronavirus appears to cause mild or no disease in dromedary camels   source  , but kills about 35  of confirmed infected humans.   cdc   sin nombre hantavirus seems to be mild in the deer mice that spread it, despite  36  fatality rate in humans.   source   mosquitoes are efficient vectors for flaviviruses like dengue and zika in part because they have adaptations we lack that protect them from the virus.   source   also, human communities are host to several viruses: about 90  of people have a herpesvirus infection   source   with similar numbers for polyomaviruses.   source   very few of these infected individuals show symptoms. the wide prevalence of these asymptomatic infections shows that the virus is successful when it can replicate while the host remains healthy. in general, virus reproduction kills cells, and when cells die faster than the host can replace them, this causes symptoms up to and including death. the host is immune system supresses virus activity, and a virus that can not evolve ways to avoid immune supression will be wiped out. but if the virus gets so good at avoiding the immune system, it will kill the host, which is bad for the virus. so both host and virus tend to evolve to a point where the immune system wins most, but not all of the time. there is a lot more to it, but i will stop here.  in conclusion, we do not really need to look for special properties of bats to explain their tolerance of coronaviruses, even though, as iayork points out, there are reasons to expect bats might be more resistant.

"Subsequent to the Democrats blocking the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in the US Senate on Sunday, March 22nd, in a 47-47 vote that was split along party lines, Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats released their own counter-proposal titled the Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act.

what were the Republican objections to the counter-proposal?
","house republican whip steve scalise has given a press release which outlines the objections of republicans to the bill, calling it a wishlist of  insane far-left policies . the objections in particular seem to relate to the amount of non-coronavirus related provisions within the bill. republicans argue that these measures are unnecessary, and an abuse of the pressure currently on congress to come up with a rescue package.  i will not reproduce the whole list of provisions that scalise has picked out as objectionable, but they include environmental reform policies, an increase to the minimum wage, a law to force companies to disclose board of director diversity statistics, and a requirement that unions should have a seat on airline corporate boards. many of these policies seem tangentially related, if at all, to the covid-19 crisis.  these concerns have been echoed by other republican groups, such as the republican house oversight committee, who tweeted:    speaker pelosi is  coronavirus bill includes:       provisions for a federal takeover of elections  a climate change study on aviation  intrusive corporate diversity reporting burdens      seriously  now is the time to help struggling americans, not play  swamp politics with virus aid.   usa today has published an opinion piece by james s. robbins on the bill, which describes it as a  christmas in march for liberal special interests . in particular, robbins takes umbrage with the changes that would be made to elections:    perhaps the most troubling sections of the bill are under the rubric    american coronavirus/covid-19 election safety and security  or    access  act. this section would impose requirements on states for  early voting, voting by mail, required mailing of absentee ballots to  everyone, ballot harvesting  i.e., having third parties deliver  absentee ballots , online voter registration, same-day registration  and other practices which undermine confidence in the integrity of the  ballot. in these days of increasing threats to election security we  should be moving rapidly back to in-person paper ballots, but this  bill would be a radical step in the wrong direction.

"Prior to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic I was under the impression that viruses fall into two categories:


Diseases from which you recover and afterwards become fully immune. When reinfected with a mutated version of the virus, you do get sick again, but it's a milder form. (common cold, influenza)
Diseases which are impossible to recover from (HIV, HPV), so you don't really gain immunity


Are there diseases which fall into a third bucket: you do recover, but can be reinfected immediately with the same strain? Note that I'm not asking about whether or not this is possible with COVID-19 - this question is purely about other diseases that we know of.

"I live &amp; work in the UK. A few weeks ago, I had a verbal offer accepted on a house (I am a first time buyer). I had initially offered a bit lower than the asking price, that offer was rejected, and I ended up offering the asking price- and asking the sellers to include some fixtures &amp; furnishings. This offer was accepted.

Since then, the coronavirus has broken out in the UK, and the markets have all dropped considerably (I was intending to put money saved in a Lifetime ISA toward the deposit- so this has obviously lost considerable value). Most things I've read are saying that we have no idea how long term the impact of the coronavirus will be on the financial markets, or whether it will impact the housing market in terms of house prices. Mortgage rates are already very low, so are unlikely to get any lower, particularly now that the Bank of England base rate has been dropped to 0.1%.

I'm unsure what to do regarding the offer I have put in on the house. I am not buying for any reason other than owning my own home, and to establish that for myself and my family. I am fortunate that my job is relatively secure- even if there were to be a recession, and even if I were to lose my job, I have a trade to fall back on which is still in a growth industry in the UK. My experience to date has been that it generally takes me between 1-2 months to apply, interview for &amp; receive an offer for a job.

So, given that I am not looking at the house for any reason other than to establish a home (i.e. it is not primarily a financial investment), should I contact the vendors to reduce my offer, given all the uncertainty going on at the moment?

If so, how would it be best to approach this, and how much should I reduce my offer by?
If not, why not?

McConnell indicated that he would try to pass the bill again on Monday, ostensibly so that Senators could see how markets would react to the lack of financial measures so far:


  We're going to vote at 9:45 in the morning (1345 GMT) ... 15 minutes
  after the markets open and see whether there's a change of heart,


This timing was not agreed to, with the debate continuing later in the day than planned, seemingly with no further bilateral progress made.

The first article also notes that Democrats ""decried the Republican proposal as prioritising the needs of Wall Street and corporate America over those of average people."", and would ""benefit corporate interests at the expense of hospitals, healthcare workers, cities and states"". Senator Elizabeth Warren, until recently a 2020 presidential candidate, told reporters that ""We're not here to create a slush fund for Donald Trump and his family, or a slush fund for the Treasury Department to be able to hand out to their friends"".

Which provisions in the bill specifically are opponents of the bill objecting to? Which measures are seen as benefiting corporate America over individuals?

"News about Romania's COVID-19-driven, reverse diaspora:


  Over 200,000 Romanians who worked abroad have returned to the country since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, with many of them coming from those EU countries strongly affected by the pandemic, PM Ludovic Orban said on Friday [March 27].
  
  “On February 25 there was only one case in Romania, two cases of coronavirus in Spain, and several others in France. Look at the number of cases in Romania, less over 1,000, and if we also take into the account the cured ones, we have below 1,000 patients with COVID-19, while there are tens of thousands of infections in other countries. Romania has taken serious measures from the start”, the premier stated.
  
  Besides, he underlined that Romania had another particularity as against the other countries, namely that over 200,000 Romanians from Diaspora returned to the homeland. “If we had not taken severe containment measures, be it quarantine or isolation, the spread would have been larger”, Orban added.


How did Romania manage to quarantine 200,000 people returning from abroad (if I understand correctly that's what they did)? What specific enforcement measures did they take?
","i do not have a complete list of all the measures taken, but in large strokes, the following things happened:   schools were closed very soon after the first cases of covid-19 were discovered  large gatherings of people were prohibited  not more than 100, then after some period not more than 50   a state of emergency was declared when there were relatively few cases of infections compared to the population number  a lot of local districts started to take actions on their own, like closing public parks. the private sector also took action. companies encouraged employees to work from home, sporting events were canceled, stores changed their program or limit the number of shoppers at any given time, hypermarkets started to disinfect their shopping carts and protect their cashiers with glass windows, trains in the subway station would pull only one by one at the platform to limit the number of passengers that would gather together. because a state of emergency was declared, new laws were passed to control what people were doing. first there were restrictions to be on the streets between 22:00 and 06:00. this lasted for a few days, then restrictions were put in place all day. now or example you are not allowed to exit the home unless for some specific reasons like buying food, seek medical help, take care of elderly people, go to work, and a few others. people above 65 are not allowed to go out of their home unless they have an emergency. for other activities they are only allowed to go out between 11:00 and 13:00. stores reinforce this by allowing only the elderly to shop in that time interval. now all parks are closed. and groups of more than 3 people are disallowed. all shops and malls that do not sell food or things you need to survive were closed.   these are a few things that happened since the whole covid-19 cases started to happen in romania.  now, to your question. because we are in a state of emergency the law was changed to account for the pandemic situation. if you have returned from abroad you need to go into self-isolation or you are placed under quarantine  for 14 days if i remember correctly . you are not allowed to leave your house and friends, family or couriers must provide you with food and supplies. you do not interact with them, they just leave them at the door. if you do not respect these measures, the fines are now very large, up to 20000 ron  more than 4000 eur , and you can also go to jail. if you breach self-isolation or quarantine and you are discovered, you are being placed under military guard so you do not do it again.  now, with that being said, you can not really monitor 200000 people or keep them in check. there are controls, but you can not really keep them isolated. many were discovered wondering the streets, going to parties, visiting friends, etc by the authorities. it helps i guess that there is some panic and people will report those that they know came from abroad and are not sitting put  mothers have reported their children to the authorities, for examples .  so basically that is what is happening right now. we have lower cases of infections than other countries because everyone reacted quickly and took measures before things were bad. because movement is restricted this limits contact between persons. people also isolated themselves in the houses by precaution before the state of emergency was declared  for example, a few days before the state of emergency was declared, people hit the stores and bought all the flour and yeast, rice, canned produce, etc to stay in home for weeks  because of worry, fear, panic.  for further reference, some details on the infection in romania:  http://instnsp.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html /5eced796595b4ee585bcdba03e30c127   on the left, in red are the total confirmed cases, in yellow are persons under quarantine, blue is people in isolation at home, in gray are the number of deceased people   my belief is that authorities panicked when they saw what was happening in italy for example  many romanians live there and return for easter holiday each year  so they took harsh measures before it was needed. it seems it helped. although they also took some bad decisions like limiting access to information  in the name of having it from official sources . i do not remember exactly, but i think that link above is from independently collected data, as authorities no longer report cases per district, but only globally.  edit: as a response to your comment i have looked up a few examples in the media:  1. in the first day of restrictions of circulation, 5,621 persons who did not comply with the measures were fined 7,404,297 ron  1,531,965 eur . that is an average of 1,317 ron  272 eur  per person.  2. in later news, the number of people who did not comply with the restrictions of circulation and were fined increased to 23,973, and an amount of 31,400,000 ron  6,496,730 eur . that is an average of 1309 ron  270 eur  per person. the same news mentions that for 209 persons a criminal record was opened and 4,235 were fined for non-compliance with the isolation/quarantine measures.  3. the news in point 2 did not mention how much the fines were for those that did not comply with isolation/quarantine, but in older news, 10 days ago, on the ministry of health is website it was stated that 1,835,000 ron  379,665 eur  of fines were applied to 120 persons for not respecting the measure of isolation. that is an average of 15,291 ron  3,163 eur  per person.  so the fines for breaking isolation/quarantine are quite large  plus getting a criminal record for more severe situations . for reference, the minimum net wage in romania is 1,346 ron  278 eur  while the average net wage is 3,189 ron  659 eur . so for a large number of people, the fines are quite large.

"Across the world, the current pandemic, and various government responses to it will impact on parties abilities to perform their obligations under a contract. 

What are the legal implications of this?
","force majeure  an event like the current covid-19 event is what is known as a force majeure event  a latin term meaning  superior force . it refers to an event that is beyond the control of the parties to a contract such as war, civil disturbance, acts of god and disease.  common law jurisdictions  in common law jurisdictions  most of the english-speaking world , force majeure is not a legal doctrine but a creature of the particular contract. that is, the extent to which a contract does or does not deal with such events is the extent to which such events apply to that particular contract. for example, a construction contract may specify that a contractor is responsible for the care, protection and reinstatement of the works unless damage is caused by war. so, if the damage is caused by war the principal bears the risk but if it is caused by, say, flood, the contractor bears the risk.  if a contract is silent on the matter  in general or in the specific  then the parties obligations remain unchanged by the event and failure to comply is a breach of contract. for example, absent a provision in a contract, in the current pandemic:   if a supplier is contracted to supply a component that was made in a foreign country and that cannot now be sourced from there  they will be in breach of their contract if they do not supply it. if it can be sourced from a local manufacturer at twice the price of the foreign source then that is the contractor is loss. if a company is contracted to provide engineering services and their staff cannot travel  either because they are sick or because of government restrictions  then they will be in breach of their contract and the principal can seek damages. if a construction contractor is obliged to finish by a given date and the government closes all construction sites, they will be in breach if they do not complete by that date notwithstanding.   these may seem to be unjust outcomes but, at the end of the day, somebody in the contract has to carry the cost of force majeure events and the development of the common law has left it for the parties to decide who. that is, at the time of negotiating the contract, the law allows that if the parties wanted to consider the risks of say, a pandemic, and spell out whose risk that was, they were free to do so and if they did not that is their own fault - in the absence of such allocation, the parties must do what the contract says they must do. common law jurisdictions have traditionally not seen it as the role of government to interfere in the details of private contracts.  common law has a much narrower doctrine of frustration but this requires that the principal purpose of the contract be impossible to perform, not merely harder or more expensive to perform. even much harder or much more expensive.  civil law  in civil law jurisdictions  continental europe with their ex-colonies and most of asia , force majeure is a legal doctrine.   it is a defence to liability where the defendant:   had nothing to do with the event - this pandemic would fit, is unpredictable - it is not certain that the pandemic was unpredictable. there have been pandemics before and many organisations around the world exist specifically to respond to them. lest this seems needlessly pedantic, there have been cases decided that because a flood occurred 69 years ago, this flood was predictable  similarly, an avalanche 50 years ago rendered this one predictable. if predictable, then the defendant is obliged to have prepared for it. the consequences must have been unpreventable.   so, even though it exists in civil law it is not a get out of jail free card.  international law  the unidroit principles encompass force majeure as follows:    non-performance by a party is excused if that party proves that the non-performance was due to an impediment beyond its control and that it could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into account at the time of the conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or overcome it or its consequences.

I'm a STEM graduate student, and with developing family finance concerns and the recent transition to remote everything both teaching and research related, I'm beginning to think it may not makes sense to drain so much of my income to stay near a closed university rather than move in with my brother.

To my reading, the lease agreement states that breaking with more than 6 months remaining will incur a penalty of 2 months' rent. Were I to attempt to back out in the next few days (well before the move-in date), could I expect the current national or state declaration of a state of emergency due to the Covid-19 pandemic to impact my penalty?

What exactly does it mean to flatten the curve?,"flattening the curve refers to the rate at which people are getting infected. without intervention, the number of individuals who contract covid-19 rises exponentially, which means it doubles at a constant rate -- in this case, every three days. at such a rate, the number of infected individuals will overwhelm our hospital system, because we simply do not have enough hospital beds and respirators to treat them all. the united states does not even have enough protective equipment at present to protect its own health care workers.   doing the math, if one person is infected with the virus on jan 1, with the number of people infected people doubling every 3 days, then by march 31, over 1 billion people will have become infected. with the world population being around 7.8 billion, it would only take until april 9 for all of us to be infected.  the situation in italy has shown us that, without enough equipment, hospitals will be compelled to turn away some of the most infirmed among us, resulting in increased fatalities.     staying home does not prevent you from contracting the virus down the line, but from contracting the virus and overwhelming the medical establishment now. postponing exposure buys time for the scientific and medical community to develop effective treatments or a vaccine to minimize or protect against infection.",30

"I read somewhere online that the US goverment may close the stock market because of Covid2019. Is the upshot the same as a company going bankrupt?

I'm still confused on put options when a company goes bankrupt : stocks


  Example:
  
  You own one $10 put option on SNAP
  
  If SNAP goes to $1, than you have the RIGHT to exercise your contract and buy 100 shares for $1 and sell it immediately for $10. If the stock price goes to $0 (in case of bankruptcy) you still have the RIGHT (and the person that sold you the option the OBLIGATION) to buy the shares for $0 so it can be sold for $10 a share.
  
  So, if when SNAP goes bankrupt whom ever wrote you that contract is obligated to give you $1000 dollars, no ifs/ands/ or buts.

","the last sentence is correct but there are some errors in the rest of the explanation.  a long put gives you the right to put the stock to someone else, meaning sell it at the strike price. this is a  10 put so if snap goes to  1, you would exercise the put, sell the stock for  10 and then buy it on the market for  1, netting  9 less whatever you paid for the put. this all assumes that the markets are open for trading.  if the financial markets are shut down, i assume that contracts will still be exercisable during a shut down and even if not, the occ exercises all options at expiration if they are one cent itm which i also assume would still be done. there might be an issue with ability to sell the stock.

"This year I had something happen to me twice, which I never witnessed before nor I thought possible: An airline has flights for the legs that I'd like to fly on, but if I try to book the whole trip, it only proposes me a more complex trip with an extra leg. In the meanwhile, the desired booking is possible on an OTA website.

I presume that this might be because OTAs have access to more inventory, but this seems weird. The two examples were:

London to Yekaterinburg: I flew with British Airways + S7. They are partner airlines and S7 can sell me the London-Moscow leg of the trip, but S7 was only offering me a more complex trip (something like: London - Berlin - Moscow - Yekaterinburg)

London to Longyearbyen: I booked a SAS trip with Layover in Oslo (cancelled due to Covid19), but the SAS website was only offering me trips like: London - Copenhagen - Oslo - Longyearbyen or London - Stockholm - Oslo -Longyearbyen 

In the above cases, I booked from an OTA, but I'd really prefer to avoid in the future (in one direction, my luggage couldn't be checked-in all the way through even if that went smoothly on the way back. I got multiple check-in codes for the same booking, and making changes is just overall much more painful if a travel agent is involved).

I just managed to find another example (again, for Longyearbyen: just an example, since I'm not currently planning of flying there in September):



As you can see, for the day only trips with 2 layover are offered.

But I checked on 4 different OTAs, and all of them are offering a booking with a single layover:


Expedia

Lucky2go





Lastminute





Gotogate




This seems even weirder, when you consider that the single legs are actually available for purchase on SAS itself:





But somehow, SAS doesn't allow me to purchase this trip directly with them.

How common is this? Are there other solutions besides booking via an OTA? Would I be able to maybe get the booking done by directly calling the airline? (and if so, would this be standard practice, or should I expect it to be hit and miss depending on the airline?)
","this happens quite regularly for multi-carrier trips. less so for single carrier trips.  airline search algorithms are often inferior  for single carrier trips, it is almost always because the airline is search algorithm does not find the trip you want, not because the airline does not sell it.  if the search tool is an in-house product, it may be inferior in an absolute sense compared to something like ita is qpx search, which many otas now use. writing a search algorithm for airline flights is a terrifically hard problem  formally it is classed as  undecidable  , and airlines do not hire the kind of computer scientists who can solve it efficiently. specialists like ita have hundreds of computer scientists.  alternatively, an airline is search may be tuned with different preferences to an ota. a lot of airlines try to avoid overnight stops, even if that would be preferable to three flights at a higher price. i would guess that is the cause of your sas problem here.  solutions   try the multicity search, and put some of the connecting cities in as if they were stopovers. when you choose the dates, choose the dates that you will actually fly that leg. this is often a good bet, but it sometimes causes the airline to price your trip with a fare break point at the stopover  i.e., as a sum of one way fares instead of a single through fare : iberia.com is particularly terrible for this shortcut. however, i notice sas has helpfully removed its multicity feature as part of the dumbing down exercise that makes the rest of its webpage unusable on a real computer. bookwithmatrix or google flights can sometimes link you directly to the desired itinerary on the airline is site.  if you do this on aa.com, you will find that you get kicked out at the payment stage if your credit card is address is not in the united states. but it turns out aa does not actually validate the country field, so you can just leave it set to united states.  call the airline, tell them what flight numbers you want to fly, and give them the price you expect. there is usually a telephone booking fee for doing this, although if you have some status with the airline it might be waived, particularly if you explain their website was not good enough to do it online. i used to have a friend at the amsterdam ticketing desk for british airways. in what i consider a crowning achievement some years ago, i constructed a price for a trip from information on expertflyer.com that was 50  lower than his system or any ota admitted, and after some back and forth with revenue management, he agreed it was a bug in their pricing system and sold me the itinerary at the lower price. :-       and if so, would this be standard practice, or should i expect it to be hit and miss depending on the airline     ba, aa, klm, 90  success rate, sometimes have to hang up and call again. qantas, jal, cathay pacific, their telephone staff and ticket desks are always reliable. air france, maybe 50 . iberia, alitalia, latam: total waste of time.   point-of-sale differences in inventory  sometimes, additional inventory is available in the city where the travel agent is based, compared to where the airline is calculating the price. to understand why that can be the case, you should know that  how many seats left for sale on a plane  is a function of the sales city as well as other factors. airline websites, in my experience, usually price from the city of origin, whereas agents usually price from a fixed point. one way to see this is from the payment currency, which will invariably be the currency of the sales city. for instance expedia.fr prices out of paris, regardless of whether the itinerary passes through that city.  this only seems to matter when the flight is filling up.  ticket issuance restrictions in the fare  sometimes, the airline really cannot sell you the trip. this may be because the trip comprises multiple fares and one of the fares has a restriction that it must be issued  on the stock  of a ticket airline. stock here refers to the old fashioned 4-part carbon paper tickets, but the concept is directly implemented in electronic ticketing. for instance, looking at a cheap s7 fare from london to yekaterinburg:  category 15: sales restrictions  tickets must be issued on s7.  note -  sales permitted on ticket stock validated or  plated s7/421 only.   even though a ba plane will fly you the first leg from london to moscow, ba could not sell you a journey involving this particular fare. airlines always sell tickets on their own  paper , not as agents for another airline  in this case, ba sells tickets on ba plate  ticket number starting  125-   and s7 sells tickets on s7 plate  ticket number starting  421-  . but a travel agent could pick any validating carrier with whom it has a ticketing agreement, subject to the fare rules and the agreement. so the travel agent has some additional flexibility.   this really only matters when you have a particularly complicated trip with multiple airlines who do not partner together very closely.

Or are Social Security payments guaranteed not to go down unless Congress introduces a new bill to do so and then has to vote on this bill and then send it to the President for signing in order to enact this SS payment reduction?
","there has been zero talk about cutting social security payments to people currently receiving payments.  there has been talk about cutting the taxes funding the social security system. the idea would be to make up the shortfall due to a tax cut by sending money from the general fund into the social security system. that plan has problems due to unemployed people not having to pay into the social security system, so a tax cut would not put money into their pocket. they might need money to pay rent and buy food.  a change to the formulas used to determine payments for people currently receiving payments would be a big deal and would not be done to counteract a short term crisis.

"With travel restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic, many academics are organizing online seminars and conferences as a substitute for regular in-person university seminars, colloquia, and research conferences.  

In real life, seminars are usually open to anyone who wants to drop in, and every attendee can be seen and heard and may ask questions.  So an obvious approach is to organize the event using video meeting software such as Zoom, and simply post the link on a public website so that any interested person can participate.  However, this also opens the event to ""Zoom bombers"", random people who just want to disrupt the proceedings with annoying or offensive video / audio / text chat - such abuse has unfortunately become very common in public Zoom meetings.

What best practices exist to keep such an event as open as possible to legitimate participants, and let them interact with each other and the speaker in a reasonable way, while reducing the risk of disruption and abuse?

What are the pros and cons of these strategies?

Strategies could be general, or involve specific features of certain software.

Some strategies I've thought of, and their drawbacks:


Create a password for the meeting.  Then the question is, to whom should the organizer give the password?  If they only give it to people they know, it excludes people who might be interested but whom they happen not to know.  If they distribute it to large mailing lists of interested academics, it raises the chance that it will fall into the wrong hands.
Offer to share the password by email upon request.  This requires extra time from the organizer to respond to those emails, and to manually verify the credentials of each requester.
Require a nominal registration fee, as real-life conferences often do.  This requires setting up an online payment system, which can be a lot of work, and may exclude people who are only casually interested, or who don't have funding, or who work in less wealthy parts of the world.  It may also involve the organizer in a lot of bureaucracy with their university as to how the fees will be managed and spent.
Use a ""waiting room"" feature, where participants must be approved immediately before joining.  However, as far as I know, the host only sees the participant's name.  If they see an unfamiliar name, how can they tell whether it is a troll, or a legitimate researcher whom they just happen not to know?  Conversely, I don't think there is anything to stop a troll from masquerading under the name of a famous academic.


I am wondering if people have thought of better solutions, that are specifically appropriate to academia.  Such strategies might take advantage of specific features of the academic community, e.g. to authenticate genuine researchers (.edu addresses? accounts on preprint servers? ORCid IDs?).  Answers could also address the pros and cons of such strategies as they apply to academia in particular, and how well they fit with people's existing expectations for academic conferences.
","how about using something other than zoom  other softwares support features that can help with this. moreover there are some serious security and privacy concerns about zoom  see e.g. this statement by the fbi and this investigation by the ny attorney general  bruce schneier has written an overview of the concerns here .  in our department we use bigbluebutton  website, wikipedia  for our classrooms and seminars. it is a completely open-source and free web conferencing system. there are a few services out there that host servers but they are completely overloaded at the moment. i would say your best bet would be to get your it services to host a server for your department. with bbb by default new users do not have their webcams activated, and you can prevent them from doing so. you can even prevent them from using their microphone and require them to virtually  raise their hand  before a moderator allows them to speak. that should cut down a lot of the abuse. you can also set up the service so that an account is required before accessing the meeting. unless the abuser is very dedicated, they probably will not bother creating dozens of accounts to continue bothering people after being kicked out, i hope.  also, something obvious: many abusers are specifically targeting zoom and going into random zoom meetings. unless you have somehow attracted abusers who are specifically targeting you, if you use something else  especially something hosted by your own department , you probably will not have any problems.  note: i am only recommending bbb because that is what we use at our department, but there are other services out there. i know another department has set up something called  panopto  for example, and another something called  classilio  - you will have to look that up, i do not know much about it. for informal meetings we use jitsi but it does not seem adequate for hosting a seminar. but in any case, if a software does not meet your requirements, you should definitely look into switching to something else, especially with the privacy concerns...

"COVID-19 has caused many large-caps' stocks to tumble like Spirit, Husky Energy ($2.75). Why don't they reverse stock split to uplift their share prices? Here are some benefits of unsplitting:


A high stock price can make the company look prestigious. E.g. A company trading at $1,000 per share will be perceived as more valuable even though the firm's market capitalization may be the same as a company whose shares trade at $50.
Share values mustn't fall too low! There have been cases where companies have split shares only to see the stock market dive, pushing shares below $10. Psychologically, this may turn off some shareholders, and in extreme cases, share prices may be too low for a company to be listed on an exchange. Companies will avoid splitting to protect themselves from this possibility. Doubtless large caps wouldn't fancy themselves dropping to being a penny stock!

","  why do not they reverse stock split to uplift their share prices    stock splits  and reverse-splits  are a zero-sum activity  minus what costs there are to actually implement the split . it is like trading 10 dimes for a dollar bill. the company is not worth any more or less after the fact. it used to be that a lower share price was desired since it would enable more investors that had to buy shares in 100-share lots. nowadays, with index funds dominating the market, that benefit has largely gone away, which is why you see companies like amazon and apple decide not to split their shares that are worth hundreds or thousands of dollars per share.   a reverse split may be required in order to stay listed on exchanges, but it often seen as a large negative signal, much like suspending a dividend.   so companies have no financial incentive to split or reverse split, but often have behavioral incentives not to reverse split.

"I am a English PhD student (focusing on literature), but this year one of my assistantships through my university has involved some grant writing for local non-profits. Recently I've been working on a small grant for a local non-profit, which will help this non-profit pay for some consultants to help it develop a strategic plan and more effective organization. (The grant is offered by a foundation that focuses on capacity-building support for non-profits in the city where I live.) Because of the impacts of COVID-19 on the non-profit sector (i.e., many of our organization's donation funds are likely to dry up), our hired consultants have generously offered to do their work pro bono. 

Here's my question: what is the etiquette of letting a grant funder know their funds are no longer needed for a specific project? To clarify, I was pretty far into the grant writing process (original LOI / project proposal approved, directed to the next steps in the application process) when we learned we'd no longer need the funds for the consultation fees. (The foundation that has offered the funds is a major donor to local non-profits, so there is a good chance that we'll be applying to them again in the future--just for a different project.) Since I corresponded a lot with a representative of the foundation, I feel like I should follow up to let them know, especially as we may be applying to them again in the future ... what are others' thoughts on this issue?

(If there's a better StackExchange community for posting this question, I apologize!)
","i would ask the representative. procedures differ wildly from funding agency to funding agency.   however, i would not be worried: everybody acted in good faith, and you are asking for less money. so in all likelihood the response will just be a short email thanking you for letting them know, and telling you that they look forward to receiving new applications from you in the future.

"In this article, it's claimed that 20% of the US thinks the US is handling the COVID-19 outbreak better than South Korea, 21% think it's about the same, 26% think it's worse, and 32% aren't sure. This is something I find surprising, since for the metrics I've been looking at, South Korea is doing better in every way:



It seems obvious that the 41% of people who think the US is doing as well as or better than South Korea are looking at different metrics than me, and I'd like to know what these other metrics are.

NB: I'm focusing on South Korea because although the original article also says the majority of Americans polled thinks the US outperforms China/Italy, there is a metric that I'm already aware of (total deaths, and in the case of Italy, total cases/deaths per capita) for which the US is doing better than those countries at the time of the poll, so if total deaths is what matters for most Americans then it's defensible to say the US is doing better. I'm not aware of any such metric for South Korea, however, which is why I'm asking.

Alternatively, what else can explain the US poll data?
","the key assumption you have made is assuming people in the us act sensibly, and that they would base their answer in the poll on facts. this assumption might not be accurate. a recent  jan 2019  study shows that facts might not be too important in this matter  1 .    inaccurate views of scientific consensus and the willful rejection of scientific consensus.  in a 2014 us survey  15 , two-thirds of respondents  67   thought that scientists did  not have a clear understanding about the health effects of gm crops,  despite broad scientific consensus on the topic  16 . similarly, half of americans  52   thought scientists were  divided  in the belief that the universe was created in the big bang, and about a third each thought that scientists were divided on anthropogenic climate change  37   and evolution  29  . of course, these data do not make clear the cause of these inaccurate views, which, arguably, could stem from people being uninformed, intentionally misinformed, or a bit of both.    furthermore, split-ballot survey experiments have shown that even when americans do seem to possess accurate knowledge of scientific consensus  however large or small that number may be for a given issue  there is no guarantee that they will integrate that knowledge into their attitudes or policy preferences  17 . in other words, these respondents know what the scientific community has established as fact, but they nonetheless refuse to  know  it. some have therefore argued that rejection of scientifically accurate accounts of the big bang or evolution by nonexpert audiences indicates neither a lack of information about scientific consensus nor the presence of misinformation, but, rather, motivated information processing  18 .  highlight mine .   given that the current us government places little value on facts and that  make america great again  was a slogan in the last election, i find it highly plausible that this is a factor here, too - that a certain amount of people simply want to believe that the us is the best in the world in everything, despite facts showing otherwise.  the study also finds:    when such directional goals influence reasoning processes, individuals are prone to  biased assimilation,  which is characterized by confirmation and disconfirmation bias, or the parallel tendencies to privilege information that is consistent with one is predispositions and to discredit information that seems contradictory  51 . as with selective exposure, motivated reasoning can contribute to an individual becoming misinformed, and it can occur not only in political contexts but also when individuals process information about science and emerging technologies  52-54 .   if you want to believe the us is  1 in everything, this seems to be a highly relevant point.  also, emotional state can be an important factor. and i think we can agree that the current crisis is a very emotional matter, and that believing the us is doing better than anyone else might be reassuring, even if it is not based on truth.    the role of emotion.  this brings us to discussions of the influence of affect in motivated reasoning processes. there is some evidence that a person is emotional state can shape the accuracy of his or her beliefs.  ...  notably, individuals  attraction to emotionally charged content is not limited to politics, and even when it comes to scientific discoveries, individuals are more inclined to spread information that has a greater emotional impact  59 .   1: scheufele, dietram a, and nicole m krause.  science audiences, misinformation, and fake news.  proceedings of the national academy of sciences of the united states of america vol. 116,16  2019 : 7662-7669. doi:10.1073/pnas.1805871115    so i think the answer is not that there are any objective metrics that show that the us is handling the crisis better in any way. the fatality rate is magnitudes higher  although it is too early to tell what the toll will be in the end , cases per capita are higher, total cases are higher, et cetera. i do not think there are those metrics that you are looking for. i rather think think it simply shows that a large percentage of the us population is either uninformed or misinformed, for various reasons as outlined above.    from the survey that was linked in the question, we can also see that the opinion on how the us is handling it relative to the rest of the world varies dramatically with the political orientation of the respondent, which would further back up that political orientation plays a significant role in how people perceive facts and responded.    the poll data for the question relative to south korea is roughly in the same boat, polarization-wise. only about 6  of republicans say the us is doing worse than south korea, whereas 45  of democrats say that:   ",66
"I am a French citizen, legally married to a US citizen. I currently live in Germany while my husband lives in the US.

I was supposed to fly to the US on Sunday (March 15) on a Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to visit my husband in the US for two weeks (until March 30). I am wondering if I can still get on the flight, and whether I should.

It is clear in the presidential proclamation that the travel restriction does not apply to spouses of US citizens. However I wonder how this is enforced. I travel with my French passport and an ESTA (visa waiver), I do not have any spouse visa or anything. Is it the airline who decides to let me on the flight? Or is it up to the immigration officer once I arrive in the US?

I also don't know if the flight is going to be cancelled. As far as the flight status shows, it is not cancelled, but I wouldn't trust that.

To make matters more difficult for myself, I got a United reservation through Chase's travel rewards program for a flight operated by Lufthansa. If the flight is cancelled or I cannot get on it, any idea who I should turn to for reimbursement? So far I have not been able to get a hold of Lufthansa customer service, they must be overloaded. I have not yet tried United or Chase.

Sorry this is such a specific and self-interested question, I just thought some of you might have similar situations or more information to share.
","there are still a lot of unknowns at this stage, so it is quite difficult to answer with any degree of certainty.   i expect you would need to be able to prove to someone  probably the airline, and then again cbp upon arrival in the us  that you are the spouse of a us citizen. make sure you have a copy of your marriage certificate or other similar document, as well as a copy of your husband is passport. there is a strong probability that many flights will be cancelled, though as us citizens and their immediate family are still allowed to travel to the us, there should still be a few flights. which ones will be operating and which ones will be cancelled is the one million dollar question. you will have to wait for lufthansa to make a decision, taking into account that this could change quite late.   i expect airlines to get in touch with passengers to:   inform them of these new measures, and the exact details of what documents are required/allowed. probably ask information so they know which passengers are still able to travel or not, which in turn will let them decide how many flights to keep, and which ones.   given the surprise announcement, they are probably scrambling to make all of that happen.  if the flight is cancelled, you should be eligible for a refund. you should probably contact chase at that point.  if the flight is not cancelled but you decide not to travel, we enter in the very gray area that the airline is probably not legally required to refund your ticket. they will most probably instead propose rebooking at a later date or the like. the fact that it is an award ticket may change things  is the ticket refundable  . again, chase is probably the right point of contact for this.  edit  the lufthansa group have announced the cancellation of all but 6 flights to/from the us from march 14th:    the lufthansa group will continue operating flights from:      frankfurt to chicago and newark  new york   zurich to chicago and newark  new york   vienna to chicago and from  brussels to washington      beyond 14 march, thus maintaining at least some air traffic connections to the usa from europe. the airlines are currently working on an alternative flight schedule for the usa. passengers will still be able to reach all destinations within the usa via the u.s. hubs and connecting flights served by our partner airline, united airlines.    all other u.s. flights will be suspended until further notice due to u.s. administration restrictions, including all departures from munich, dusseldorf and geneva. the lufthansa group will continue to serve all destinations in canada until further notice.

"It is well-known that South-Korea has developed a powerful system of drive-through testing allowing them to test hundreds of thousands of person in the past two months. I was wondering whether the test-subjects all visit those testing stations on a voluntary basis (because they are worried about their health) or whether true random samples of the population are being tested, supposedly requiring a government order to have certain people take a test on a (semi)compulsory basis.

To summarize: Is SK conducting random covid-19 tests on sizeable random samples of its population? Is any other country with a major outbreak doing such a thing?

This question arose in my mind in the light of rumours that the covid-19 epidemic would have a tendency to create a pool of infected 10 times larger than reported because alledgedly the main bulk of the infected don't experience grave symptoms and do not seek out a test or diagnosis. 
","south korea has adopted a highly technical and transparent approach to covid-19. by sharing where infected people have been, citizens can see if they have been in contact or near contact with the infected person, and then request a test.    since the first cases were confirmed, korean public health authorities and local governments collaborated to precisely document the movement of infected people down to the minute. authorities sought testimony, watched closed-circuit television, investigated smartphone gps data and more, publicizing the so-called moving histories of covid-19 patients. all local governments share information through websites, text messages, and media. companies have developed apps that allow users to visualize the information. koreans can now learn where infected people went, when they were there, and how they got there. if someone learns they might have been exposed, they can quickly visit a doctor and begin self-quarantine if they have similar symptoms.    on february 4, the korea centers for disease control and prevention took advantage of the post-mers reform and authorized an unlicensed covid-19 test  the government went on to test an extraordinary number of people. by february 26, korea had tested 46,127 cases, while by that point, japan had tested just 1,846 cases and the united states only 426. tests still remain hard to come by in the united states, despite the trump administration is repeated suggestions that widespread testing is imminent.   there are few countries as technologically advanced as south korea that are able to adopt this approach without a wide spread lockdown. and it helped that they allowed the use of an unapproved tests whereas in the usa the cdc blocked the use of independent tests which has lead to their current deplorable state of testing.    following the end of the mers outbreak, south korea enacted a new law in 2016 that allows laboratories to use unapproved in-vitro diagnostic kits in the case of a public health emergency.   and     testing is absolutely critical with a fast-travelling virus like this,  says kang.  we have tested over 350,000 cases so far - some patients are tested many times before they are released, so we can say they are fully cured. altogether, we are talking about one out of 145 or one out of 150 people having been tested so far.    http://thebulletin.org/2020/03/south-korea-learned-its-successful-covid-19-strategy-from-a-previous-coronavirus-outbreak-mers/  http://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/south-korea-covid-19-containment-testing/ ",143

"To reduce the risk of infection by viruses (including 2019-nCoV) the CDC suggests:


Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when you are sick.

To my knowledge most alcohol-based hand sanitizers use ethanol. In clinical settings sometimes isopropanol is also used.

Question: How exactly do alcohols, especially ethanol and isopropanol provide some disinfecting action against viruses? Are the virus particles simply dissolved? What happens?
","alcohols dissolve lipid bilayers  many viruses have an outer lipid bilayer. ethanol lyses cells, and in the same fashion damages membrane-bound viruses by rupturing the bilayer  which is made of ethanol-soluble lipids .   alcohols misfold the protein coats of viruses  additionally, alcohols denature proteins, which misfold in non-aqueous conditions. some viral surface proteins are important for adhesion and attachment, and misfolding these renders the virus inactive. the total breakdown of viruses is essentially due to the misfolding of their protein coat  the capsid .  the same goes for bacteria  with the additional effect of dehydrating cells  alcohols substitute the water contents of a tissue and have been as such used as fixatives. common laboratory examples include methanol and ethanol.  typically, 70   140 proof  ethanol is used for bench wiping to kill or inactivate microbes. this includes viruses.  this is all standard, common, easily and readily accessible knowledge. here is a bonus source.

Can be a factor contributing to the outbreaks in South Korea / Italy the fact that they are in the northern hemisphere / winter , and that Australia is in the southern hemisphere / summer by February? Could an outbreak as fast as those which happened in South Korea / Italy happen in a country which is in summer by the time it happens?

"The US government suspended travel from Europe to US, except for countries which are not in the Schengen area such as the UK and Ireland.

Many comments from EU leader seem to assume that this is a political decision rather than a health-based decision, especially with regard to this exception.

Is there any official rationale for this exception?
","the official rationale, according to trump is presidential proclamation, is that the centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  could become overwhelmed  if sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus occurred in the united states on a large scale . it continues:    the world health organization has determined that multiple countries  within the schengen area are experiencing sustained person-to-person  transmission of sars-cov-2.     ...     the schengen area currently has the largest number of confirmed  covid-19 cases outside of the people is republic of china. as of march  11, 2020, the number of cases in the 26 schengen area countries is  17,442, with 711 deaths, and shows high continuous growth in infection  rates. in total, as of march 9, 2020, the schengen area has exported  201 covid-19 cases to 53 countries. moreover, the free flow of people  between the schengen area countries makes the task of managing the  spread of the virus difficult.    the united states government is unable to effectively evaluate and  monitor all of the travelers continuing to arrive from the schengen  area. the potential for undetected transmission of the virus by  infected individuals seeking to enter the united states from the  schengen area threatens the security of our transportation system and  infrastructure and the national security. given the importance of  protecting persons within the united states from the threat of this  harmful communicable disease, i have determined that it is in the  interests of the united states to take action to restrict and suspend  the entry into the united states, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of  all aliens who were physically present within the schengen area during  the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the  united states.   the reasoning exposed in the proclamation, then, is that due to the lack of travel restrictions between schengen countries, it is far harder to manage the spread of the disease by controlling inter-schengen migration. this factor is attributed by the proclamation as the main cause of community spread throughout the 26 member countries, and even goes as far as to tacitly blame the international spread of the disease on the area.  at a practical level, consider someone arriving to the usa from slovenia, a member of the schengen area. while slovenia itself only has 31 cases currently, it is impossible for usa immigration officials to tell whether that person has just driven from italy, which has over 10,000 cases. as a result, the trump administration seems to have decided that the best way to deal with this issue is a blanket ban  with some exceptions, e.g. us citizens, travellers invited by the us to aid efforts against covid-19 etc. see proclamation for full details  on travel from the schengen area countries and visitors who have visited the area within the last 14 days, the incubation period of the disease.  travellers from a non-schengen area, however, seem to be presumed to be able to prove that they have not been in any schengen countries in the last 14 days by their passport records, and as such the level of risk they pose should be able to be more easily evaluated.  however, as pointed out in the comments, inter-european travel does not involve passport stamping in some cases, for example from italy to the uk, so it will be difficult to identify these travellers practically. it is unclear how immigration officials will mitigate this.  the reasoning of the proclamation, however, remains that travel restrictions could be easily imposed between, to use our example, italy and the uk, meaning that travellers from the uk are lower risk.  update 14/03: the travel ban has now been extended to the uk and ireland, which calls into question the original official rationale, but does not change it.

"(This is not about the coronavirus pandemic, which I understand is a different issue, but about the six countries that had already been maintaining border controls since related to migration and terrorism since 2016.)

Could someone explain to me the legal basis of Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway's extension of ""temporary reintroduction of border control"" declarations past the original 2-year deadline in November 2017? I'm trying to understand what the legal justification was for that, and I just keep getting more and more confused the more I read. Was the Commission's recommendation of September 2017 on extending the time frames adopted at some point? Or did they find some other loophole? 

I have found some media references to them ""switching to France's strategy"" (which I don't understand well either) or switching from Article 29 provisions to Article 25 provisions. But when I read the Schengen Borders Code, I can't find anything in Article 25 that I can manage to interpret as allowing unlimited extensions.

I understand that there's an argument that what these five countries and France have been doing is indeed illegal, but I want to also understand what their own lawyers' argument would be for its legality.

Thanks in advance!
","regarding germany, austria, denmark, sweden, and norway, details can be found on the commission website. according to the table of all notifications, they all periodically invoke the  security situation in europe and threats resulting from the continuous significant secondary movements . this is obviously in blatant contradiction with article 25 but in practice that does not matter. you cannot find anything in there foreseeing unlimited extensions because there is not. it is as simple as that, no sophisticated legal wizardry is involved  regarding the fate of juncker is 2017 proposal: that limit has not changed since the current framework was introduced in 2013 and is still present in the june 2019 consolidated version of the borders code .  by contrast, france is strategy is to ignore the law entirely  as opposed to merely ignoring some specific clause of article 25 : introduce quasi-systematic checks on some borders, do not try to create half-hearted legal justifications, do not notify the commission or invoke some generic  persistent terrorist threat  applying to all borders and count on the commission to carefully avoid challenging france on this. back in 2015, the country suffered a string of deadly terrorist attacks and ultimately activated a state of emergency so that it had already invoked the right to reintroduce border controls and did not need any additional notification when the refugee crisis worsened.  the table on the commission is website gives some additional insight into how all this came to pass. back in 2015, many countries invoked article 28 with rather specific justifications related to the increasing number of refugees entering the schengen area. after this initial unilateral move, the council issued three recommendations to give these countries some legal cover  november 2016, february 2017, and may 2017  while roughly following the letter of article 25  no more than six-month extension at once, not more than two years of border controls in total . meanwhile, the commission initiated a  back to schengen  strategy to try to salvage open borders in the schengen area and make sure they appeared to be in charge.  but in reality, the countries in question were clearly intent on imposing checks no matter what, even if it was not possible to find some other face-saving legal basis. so when the last six-month period expired, they stopped being so specific and just reverted to a generic notification while everybody else turned a blind eye.  note that the commission does have a tool to enforce these rules and force a member state to, at the very least, make an effort to offer a more detailed legal rationale for its actions: infringement proceedings. for a long time, rules pertaining to the  area of freedom, security and justice  were subject to different rules but since 2014, it falls under the ordinary eu law regime. the commission has however been very shy in launching infringement proceedings on such a politically sensitive topic.

","questions about whether a certain action is  just  tend to be maters of opinion, politics and philosophy, but it can be addressed from the perspective of legal theory  especially following the model of common law, where legal principles are based on concepts of just and proper action . whether or not a certain action is actually legal in a certain jurisdiction depends on the laws of that country -- i suspect that the answer is different for the us versus china.  the first question would be whether those government officials have the legal authority - i assume they do. such authority is generally governed by some specific circumstances, for example,  poses an imminent and grave threat to public health . it is basically not a legal question whether quarantining in the face of this viral threat is necessary from a public health perspective, that is a medical question. what the law would say is that if this is a serious threat, then a person is liberty can be curtailed to a limited extent, because a person does not have the right to harm others because they do not want to do some thing that protects the rights of others  be vaccinated, stay in quarantine until it is safe . however, principles of legal justice also say that the government is response should be proportionate, e.g. shoot-on-sight in response to a sneeze is not proportionate.   quarantining has long been recognized as a valid, just and legal response to such extreme medical threats. historically speaking, quarantining used to be the only effective action that a government can take against e.g. smallpox, plague, spanish flu, ebola.

China has also been criticised for its initial response to the virus, which the Financial Times describes as a ""cover-up"", and which US national security advisor Robert O'Brien says ""cost the world community two months"" in terms of preparation for the disease. This would appear to be in breach of the International Health Regulations (2005), Article 6 of which states that:

  within 24 hours of assessment of public health information, of all

  Infectious Diseases, personal communication, 2020). Although
  these data cannot be used to determine whether transmission

This reminded me of answer(s) to Was 14,000+ year old DNA “laying around in cave dirt” protected from degradation, or is it just naturally this robust? which explain that small fragments of DNA can be quite stable in some environments; in some places on Earth the DNA in the soil can be ten thousand years old.

Question: Roughly speaking how stable are short sections of single-stranded RNA in exposed environments compared to double-stranded DNA?

The answer is likely to contain ""It depends on..."" as did the answer to the DNA stability question, I'm primarily interested in the differential stability between the two.
","the main difference in stability is due to the very high amounts of rnase in pretty much all fresh biological materials. naked rna is easily degraded by just touching it with skin. the first step in most rna extractions is often to add an rnase inhibitor.  for example, from wikipedia is ribonuclease  rnase contamination during rna extraction:    the extraction of rna in molecular biology experiments is greatly complicated by the presence of ubiquitous and hardy ribonucleases that degrade rna samples. certain rnases can be extremely hardy and inactivating them is difficult compared to neutralizing dnases. in addition to the cellular rnases that are released, there are several rnases that are present in the environment. rnases have evolved to have many extracellular functions in various organisms.

","first of all,  the computation is very theoretic and not a good representation or guideline for adapting your behavior  just in case, if that is what you are after . in the comments i had already mentioned several points of critique for this approach:   the problem is that these computations will be based on highly subjective estimates about the underlying model/assumptions. yes, you can compute it.... but do not expect that the answer is rigorous just because it has used mathematics another problem is that the descriptions of contacts are very complex. how exactly are you gonna be in the description of the notime of contact   are you differentiating just the time of contact or also the type of contact  it is not a deterministic model and you need to deal with with distributions and stochastic behaviour that will make computations more difficult.  see for example the report about transmission of sars in airplanes: there were three cases described with an infected person on board. in one case tens of other passengers got infected. in the other two cases it was only one other person  a crew member  that got infected.  in addition, are you gonna describe the probability for a single person, or the probability for the public health  in high traffic the probability for a single individual might be low but due to the large number of individuals in those situations there might be a probability that at least one or more persons get infected.   for public health, the problem is not to compare cases based on the probabilities for individuals to become sick. but instead, the point is to reduce the probability for individuals spreading the virus, make others sick. in general those probabilities  to make others sick  are much higher with high traffic cases. sick people should not be around many other people.  there are many of these strange probability effects around. for instance, in europe there is a lot of focus on people who had contact with the high risk areas  and it seems to be ignored that one may acquire the virus locally as well.  indeed, when considering only a contact with a single person, then it is more likely to obtain the virus if this person is from  or had contact with  a high risk area. however, due to the much larger number of contacts with people outside the risk area it may be more likely to acquire the virus from one of those people, albeit the fact that the risk per contact is lower. still, it is not illogical to focus on the high risk areas. but that is more a consideration from the point of view of focusing the limited time, money and materials. yes, it is more likely to get the coronavirus from somebody that is not from the risk area is. but there are many other viruses from which one may obtain a common cold and we can not deal with all of those cases. when we wish to focus efforts on the most important cases, then the consideration is for which people the common cold is most likely to be due to the coronavirus. in that case it is linked to the high risk areas.      a possible solution  based on a simple model ,  let is consider the  unrealistic  probability of obtaining an infection, conditional on the other person being sick  this is a bit complex, there are different levels of being sick but let is consider this for single cases .  say, the probability noto get sick from a single contact of time  t   is a function of contact time according to some  sort of  homogeneous poisson process  ie. the waiting time to get hit/sick depends on an exponentially distributed variable and the longer the contact the more likely to get sick      p  text sick from contact time  t      1 - e  - lambda t     if you encounter  n  people, each for a time  t , sampled from a population of which  p    are sick...   then the number of sick people,  s , that you encounter is binomial distributed   p s s      n  choose s   p s 1-p   n-s    the probability of getting sick from those  s  people is:   p  text sick   vert t,s    1- e  - lambda ts    the marginal probability of getting sick is    begin array    p  text sick   vert t, n   amp     amp   sum  s 0  n  overset   substack  llap  text probability   rlap  text  to encounter        llap  text  s  sick    rlap  text people        overbrace p s s         times  underset   substack  llap  text probability to    rlap  text get sick       llap  text conditional    rlap  text  on       llap  text encountering  s     rlap  text  sick people        underbrace p  text sick   vert t,s              amp   amp  1-  sum  s  0  n   s  choose n   p s 1-p   n-s e  - lambda ts      amp   amp  1-  left 1- p   pe  - lambda t  right  n   end array    where i solved this last term with wolframalpha.   note that      lim  n to  infty  1-  left 1- p   pe  - lambda t/n  right  n   1 - e  - lambda t p      for a given fixed total contact  c   n times t  times  lambda  you get an increase as function of  n . for instance, if  c   10  then:    intuitive overview  below are two graphs that show the value of this term  1-  left 1- p   pe  - lambda t  right  n   as function of contact time  t  and number of contacts  n . the plots are made for different values of  p .  note the following regions:   on the right side the contact time is very large and you are almost certainly gonna get infected if the person that you have contact with is sick. more specifically for the lower right corner  if  n 1  and  t  is very large  the probability of getting sick will be equal to  p   ie. the probability that the other person is sick .  more generally for the right side, the region where   lambda t gt 1 , a change in the contact time is not gonna change much the probability to get sick from a single person  this curve  1-e  - lambda t   does not change much in value for large   lambda t  .  so if   lambda t gt 1   and you are almost certainly getting sick if the other person is sick  then if you halve the contact time and double the number of contacts, then this is gonna increase the probability to get sick  because the probability to encounter a sick person increases . on the left side for   lambda t  lt  1  you will get that at some point an increase of  n  with an equal decrease of  t  will counter each other. on the left side it does not matter whether you have high traffic short time vs. low traffic high time.         conclusion  so, say you consider total contact time  n times t  being constant, then this should lead to a higher probability for getting sick for higher  n   shorter contacts but with more people .   limitations  however the assumptions will not hold in practice. the time of contact is an abstract concept and also the exponential distribution for the probability of getting sick from a single person is not accurate.   possibly there might be something like contact being more/less intense in the beginning  to compare in the simple model the probability to get sick from a single contact of time  t  is approximately linear in time  1-e   lambda t   approx  lambda t   also when considering infections of groups, instead of individuals, then there might be correlations like when a sick person sneezes then it will hit multiple people at the same time. think about the cases of superspreaders, e.g. the case of the sars outbreak in the amoy gardens apartment complex where likely a single person infected hundreds of others    so based on the simple model there is this effect that of for a given total time of contact,  n  times t , is better to spread it out among less people,  n .  however, there is an opposite effect. at some point, for short  t , the transmission will be relatively unlikely. for instance, a walk on a busy street means high  n  but the contacts will not be meaningful to create a high risk.  potentially you could adapt this first equation  1 - e   lambda t   but it is very subjective/broad . you could think like something as the  5 seconds rule   which is actually not correct but gets close to the idea .  use of the simple model  although the model used here is very simplistic, it does still help to get a general idea about what sort of measures should be taken and how the principle would work out for a more complex model  it will be more or less analogous to the simple model :   on the right side  of the image , it does not help much to change  reduce  the contact time, and it is more important to focus on reducing the number of contacts  e.g. some of the rigorous advise for non-sick family-members that are in quarantine together with sick family members are not much useful since restricting   lambda t  for large   lambda t  has little effect and it would be better to focus on making less contacts  go cook yourself instead of ordering that pizza   on the left side, reductions should be weighed against each other. when restrictions that reduce high traffic are gonna lead to low traffic but a longer time then the measures are not gonna help a lot.   a very clear example: i am currently waiting in line to enter the supermarket. they have decided to reduce the number of total people inside the supermarket. but this is entirely useless and possibly detrimental. the total time that we are in contact with other people does not decrease because of this.  and there are secondary effects: partners alone at home with children that have to wait longer. potential shopping at multiple markets because time is limited at single markets. etc. it is just silly   i am letting the older people in the line pass before me since the health effects may be worse for them. and in the meantime i make myself annoyed about this symbolical useless measure  if not even detrimental  and have sufficient time to type this edit in this post, and in the meantime either make other people sick or become sick myself.

"I have read a lot about the outbreak of the coronavirus, I know that in january scientists had already sequenced the viral genome.

How was the virus identified prior to the sequencing

Given that viruses are not like germs that you can see and distinguish readily in microscope, how could scientists know that there was something new about the new disease and how could they purify the pathogen that cause that disease without knowing what it is and without knowing its genetic code?

Where can I find information about procedures that are used to identify new viral pathogens?

Given that there is a group of people with suspicious desease, what are the laboratory procedures used to eliminate known pathogens and how you discover that you have a novel virus without knowing its genetic sequence (and without the ability to extract it - as far as I know you can not isolate virus particle with tweezers...).

Thank you!    
","this is basic epidemiology. when medical professionals notice that a group of people with some characteristic in common, are being seen for a similar disease, they ask if there is a connection. in this case, several people in wuhan were diagnosed with severe pneumonia, and the doctors noticed that they worked in the same location.     three adult patients presented with severe pneumonia and were admitted to a hospital in wuhan on december 27, 2019. ... her occupation was retailer in the seafood wholesale market. ... he had been a frequent visitor to the seafood wholesale market.   --a novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in china, 2019  you are more likely to follow up when the disease is unusual or severe, and when the connecting factor is unusual or suspicious. in this case, the severe pneumonia was presumably unexpected, and live animal markets always have potential for disease transmission.    in fact, it is quite possible that the virus had been circulating in the region for weeks before this cluster was noticed, and that previous cases had not been surprising enough to trigger the research needed to identify a new virus  though it is also likely that the medical personnel in wuhan had noticed that there were an usually high number of pneumonia cases and were already looking for a connection.   see also the answers to how did scientists discover hiv . old-fashioned epidemiology is always critical.  the same article explains how the virus was sequenced:    bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid samples were collected in sterile cups to which virus transport medium was added. ... rna extracted from bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid and culture supernatants was used as a template to clone and sequence the genome. we used a combination of illumina sequencing and nanopore sequencing to characterize the virus genome.    and isolated:    ... supernatant from bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid samples was inoculated onto the apical surface of the cell cultures. ... after three passages, apical samples and human airway epithelial cells were prepared for transmission electron microscopy. ...    so briefly, they took patient samples, grew them on cultured cells, used electron microscopy to check the kind of virus. they sequenced fluid  not cells, since the virus would be secreted into the fluid, making it a relatively pure source of virus rna  and then sequenced using a standard high-throughput sequencing approach  knowing the likely kind of virus would make this easier but is not essential. there would have been lots of human rna in the sequence, but it is easy to bioinformatically separate that out and limit your analysis to the viral sequences. the virus isolate was also not essential for the identification  knowing the sequence is the critical information today. but having a virus isolate certainly makes all the subsequent work much easier.  this is pretty standard modern molecular biology, not an esoteric skill.

"I have seen websites and videos that show how cancer cells can be destroyed using sound resonance oscillation. So has anyone heard of anyone who is in the field of sound resonance trying to capture the wavelength of the Corona virus so we can create a Sonogram machine to use against this virus pandemic?
","it is a nice idea. sadly it will not work but there is still some interesting physics involved.  as a general rule resonance is only an efficient way to transfer energy to an object if that object has a high q factor. a high q factor means the energy supplied builds up and increases the amplitude of the oscillation, and this may get large enough to damage the object. this is the  alleged  mechanism for the shattering of wine glasses by overenthusiastic sopranos. wine glasses have a high q and you can tell this by the way they ring for a while when you tap them. as a contrast, potatoes have a low q and do not ring when you tap them. so our sopranos would have a hard time shattering a potato.  the problem with using ultrasound to kill cells or viruses is that in general they are squishy low q objects like potatoes, not high q objects like wine glasses, and they do not store the energy of the sound efficiently enough for the amplitude of oscillation to build up to destructive levels. so the technique simply will not work.  ultrasound is used to kill tumours, but this does not work by resonance - the energy in the sound simply heats the cancer tissue and kills it. it is used for tumours because the sound can be focused onto the tumour where it causes local heating. this would not work for viral infections since the virus is distributed throughout the body not concentrated in one area onto which the sound can be targeted.  even if viruses were brittle like glass it would still be hard to make them resonate enough to be damaged when they are in a fluid like water. there are two reasons for this.  firstly water is much denser and much more viscous than air so it efficiently damps the vibrations of any objects moving in it. for example if you tap a glass underwater it will not ring as it does in air. so even objects that have a high q factor in air will have a drastically lower q factor in water. this applies to viruses in humans since as far as sound waves are concerned human tissue is little different from water.  secondly sound waves are a compression wave and they propagate by alternately compressing and expanding the water. the amount the water compresses and stretches is determined by the bulk modulus and this is relatively high. that means the amplitude of the wave is small unless the energy is very high, and consequently the mechanical deformation of objects in the water by the wave is small. this makes it hard to deform the virus enough to damage it.

"I started grad school last September, and so far have been primarily busy with courses, but have been trying to do a little research on the side whenever I can. I recently finished all my courses though, and now I'm expected to dive into research.

My advisor hasn't assigned me a project and expects me to come up with one on my own. I don't mind this really, I like the freedom to work on whatever I want. However, this was only really feasible when I was in my lab and surrounded by senior PhD students with whom I could bounce ideas off and get a lot of guidance from. 

However, now I'm stuck at home because of the COVID19 lockdown and don't really know how to productively spend my time doing research. My advisor is busy taking care of his family at home because of the lockdown, so he isn't very responsive right now understandably. I'm all alone at home so I don't have the guidance of senior PhD students either. I've tried messaging senior PhD students but it's not fair for me to constantly be harassing them for help...

Apart from heavily guided stuff in undergrad, I have next to no real research experience... Since I assume I'll be stuck at home for the next several months, how can I be productive research wise with basically no guidance or help from anyone? I don't want to just waste the next few months...

FYI, I'm doing research in engineering but everything is done using simulations, so while I have all the tools and equipment I need to do research at home, I just don't have the experience or guidance to efficiently do so.

I've been trying to just read papers in the meantime, but I can only read so many before I get sick of it. I don't want to just be reading papers for 40 hours a week for the next 3 months...
","you can try to fill the gaps in your knowledge and skills. for example, learn some techniques that are commonly used in your field. even if you will not need them for your immediate project, there is a chance that they will be useful for the next one. for example, if you do engineering, you are likely to need to write some code, so you can improve your software engineering skills. your colleagues may give you some more ideas on what is useful to learn.  if you feel sick of reading papers alone, you might try to reach to other junior students and form a virtual study group where you discuss and critically analyze recently published papers. you may actually come up with some ideas for research project based on the discussions. good luck  ",114
"What preventative measures should people take to avoid infecting others that they are in contact with, such as family members, who are more vulnerable (elderly and/or individuals with underlying health conditions) to the virus?

In particular, what should be done when someone needs to leave home regularly for work, despite having contact with vulnerable people at home?
","if your relative stays at home without contact with anyone from the outside world, they have zero risk of getting the disease. if a relative living in the house needs to leave daily they risk exposure and getting the infection. the relative at home now has a non-zero risk of getting infected.  if the relative at home is independent then they should be left to live alone, and the working relative move in with someone else. if that is not possible, then another person not known to be infected should move in with her, and the working relative moves out.  if the working relative is the main carer for the relative at home, and the above choices are not possible, then they have to manage the situation as though they already have the virus.  the recommendation is that you are not going to transmit the infection to someone who remains at a 6 foot distance away from you, and if inside that distance for less than 10-15 minutes. so, that stops viral droplets from one person passing to the next.  viral nuclear droplets form when aerosols develop, eg flushing the toilet, so the toilet lid needs to stay down when flushing, and keep windows open. even better still use different bathrooms, or build a composting toilet away from the bathroom shared with the other person. if you are not able to not share bathrooms, then all the surfaces needs to be wiped down with .1  solution of bleach after each use of the bathroom, and left to dry for 10-30 minutes. each door knob needs to be disinfected. there can not be any shared eating utensils. and most importantly the hands need to be washed for a minimum of 20 seconds using a soap/detergent.  even if people live together, studies in china showed that cross infection was not inevitable, but closer to 20  of households had transmission.  http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection ",88
"Covid-19 has forced a suspension of at least 50% of financial transactions and business activities. 

Materially, not much has been lost: consumables have been spared, equipment is dormant, maintenance is mostly inexpensive. Why is the health crisis expected to bankrupt many businesses? Is most of the loss speculative?

Propery tax + land rental = 20-25% of yearly rent, so a landlord can waive rent for 6 months and still make profit! enough to pay 2 years of tax and maintenance. 

I naively imagine that using government moratoriums on bank-debt-interest rates and fees, It is possible for companies to organize a state of dormancy and maintenance for an extended period, without incurring significant loss. 

Can you give a summary of why it is not so simple, and why the losses are a lot worse than a financial and material dormancy? 
","it creates losses.   first, many businesses do not own their own building/land/equipment. it is very common to lease these things. moreover, many business take out insurance that again has to be paid on monthly basis. in europe in many countries you need to pay workers certain portion of wages even when you can not call worker to work or even if they stay home sick.   the list here is not exclusive. the point is many business have non-trivial fixed costs that have to be payed whether business operates or it does not. furthermore, in short run even some variable costs - like wages to employees on production line are fixed  and in many countries this can be up to several months . hence, it is not like a dormant business have no costs.   you might ask why then we do not suspend for example these leases etc. but that just moves the problem to the different parties and does not eliminate this issue.   moreover, very large business might have enough financial cushion to absorb losses for few months, but there are many small-medium size business that can not do that. for example, consider a sole trader  a form of business organization where one person embodies a business  who has a repair shop with no employees just living month to month. that kind of businessman can not afford to go on hiatus for very long.  furthermore, if by long you mean not just weeks but several months or even year that would be issue even for the best cushioned business.  so yes the impact could be catastrophic. for example according to this vox blog the impact under some scenarios could be worse than recent 2008 crisis.

"During Covid19 pandemic I managed to save some money and I was thinking about repaying some of my debts, however, I'm not sure should I do it, or keep cash just in case things turn for the worse. This is my situation with concerns against repaying each debt.

I have roughly 7000 GBP

I have three debts:


6500 GBP overdraft (APR 35%)  
2500 GBP PayPal credit (APR 19.9%) 
1600 GBP Amex credit card (APR 23.5%)


I could repay my overdraft, it would save me around 150 GBP each month and I could still use it as if money would be in my bank account in case of a real emergency.

I could repay both PayPal and Amex cards saving around 120 GBP each month and have some money left. My concern is that PayPal Credit and Amex are the least acceptable forms of payment in the UK and in case I would need access to money there is a chance I won't be able to use.

I can just keep the cash and pay interest on all three accounts until crisis is over.

What should i do?
","keeping some liquid cash is sensible, but the exorbitant rates on your debt will hurt you long-term. pay them off as quickly as safely possible.  since you have high-interest debt, getting rid of that debt is more important than maintaining a large emergency fund. having both savings and overdraft fees is illogical. however, i understand that you would rather have cash than paying of other debts if you expect to be laid off soon.  to save the most money, the optimal solution is to pay off the highest-interest debt first. here, that is the overdraft.  unless you will also be able to pay off the other debts within a couple of months, it could be sensible to refinance. a small loan for ps5000 at 6  over 12 months    ps440/month  could give you breathing room to pay off all high-interest debts and stabilize your finances - if you are still eligible for such loans.  aside from affecting job stability, the covid-19 situation does not change a lot. if you have struggled to live without debt pre-corona, it will not get easier now. that is why it could be helpful to pay off as much as possible now, so that you are not saddled with endless interest payments in more difficult times: who knows how long this crisis will last  and you need to figure out why you have so much cash and so much debt, but that is out of scope here.

N95 which filter 95% of particulates, while N99 or N100 filter 99% and 99.97%, respectively.

For example:


  Health officials recommend medical staff wear so-called N95 masks because they filter out about 95% of all liquid or airborne particles.


The N95 equivalent in Europe is FFP2, the N99/100 equivalent in Europe is FFP3, and the N95 equivalent in South Korea is KF94.



Prior research:

  Infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, MD, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells Health that the N95 is still the recommended face mask for health professionals, because it has the capacity to filter out very small particles that could possibly contain the virus. “This is different than a surgical mask, which can only stop larger droplets,” says Dr. Adalja.

  In the United States, respirators must meet NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) standards. Within this standard, there are several classes of respirators depending on the degree of oil resistance:
  
  Class N: no oil resistance. A distinction is made between N95, N99 and N100. The number after the letter indicates the percentage of filtration of suspended particles


https://www.businessinsider.com/wuhan-coronavirus-face-masks-not-entirely-effective-2020-1


  When worn correctly, N95 respirators block out at least 95% of small airborne particles. So the respirators can filter out some droplets carrying coronavirus. The coronavirus itself measures between .05 and 0.2 microns in diameter, according to a recent article in The Lancet.

","yes, there are several  upsides  as you put it.    it is cheaper it is easier to breath in it is sufficient for catching particles smaller than it is actually designed for...   now, that last point is what is important. according to 3m is own documentes on various types of filters and masks, it seem that there is an electrostatic effect between the layers of the filters and the particles hitting it. so:   filter  grid  does not have to be smaller than the particles themselves apparently because of the electrostatic effects, particles are attracted to - and prefer to stick to, the fibers of the filter.    from  2 :    because of the various mechanisms by which particulate filtration occurs, the smallest particles are typically not the most difficult to filter. most particulate filters have a region of lower filtration efficiency somewhere between 0.05-0.5 mm.1 particles in this range are large enough to be less effectively pushed around by diffusion, but small enough to be less effectively captured by interception or impaction. the most penetrating particle size  mpps  will depend on the filter media, air flow, and electrostatic charge on the particle. filters that use electrostatic attraction may have a mpps shifted to a slightly smaller size range.       appendix a  equivalent mask standards  1   n95  united states niosh-42cfr84  ffp2  europe en 149-2001  kn95  china gb2626-2006  p2  australia/new zealand as/nza 1716:2012  korea 1st class  korea kmoel - 2017-64  ds  japan jmhlw-notification 214, 2018    appendix b  classiifcations   2   standard classification filter efficiency niosh 42 cfr 84 n95    95  niosh 42 cfr 84 n99    99  niosh 42 cfr 84 n100    99.97  en 149:2001 ffp1  filtering facepiece     80  en 149:2001 ffp2  filtering facepiece     94  en 149:2001 ffp3  filtering facepiece     99  en 143:2000, en 140:1999, en136:1998 p1  elastomeric facepiece     80  en 143:2000, en 140:1999, en136:1998 p2  elastomeric facepiece     94  en 143:2000, en 140:1999, en136:1998 p3  elastomeric facepiece     99.95  gb2626-2006 kn/kp90    90  gb2626-2006 kn/kp95    95  gb2626-2006 kn/kp100    99.97    references:   1 comparison-ffp2-kn95-n95-filtering-facepiece-respirator-classes  2  respiratory protection for airborne exposures to biohazards  3  faq  4  mask shelf-life  5  various disposable  6  3m disposable respirators for personal safety  7  surgical n95 vs. standard n95  ",66

","negotiate with your neighbour  force majeure in english law only exists if it is detailed in the contract. there is no general legal concept like there is in civil law jurisdictions. further, even if there was such a clause, it would need to capture covid-19 within the definition of force majeure either by defining it sufficiently broadly or by naming  pandemics  a one type of force majeure event.  english law has the much narrower doctrine of frustration but that requires that the supervening event becomes impossible, not just more onerous or expensive. it does not apply here.  it is also possible for a contract to have a change of law clause - this would probably apply to covid-19 since the proximate reason for your work stopping is likely a government regulation. however, these are generally worded to allow the payee to recover additional costs of complying with the law, not to reduce the payer is obligations. notwithstanding, i am guessing that your contract does not have one of these either.  in your case you are required to keep paying and the have the scaffold removed before the deadline or you will be in breach and liable for damages. under the terms of your contract, you took the risk of pandemics even if you did not know you were.

"From a TV news report of a press conference from (I think) the German Robert Koch Institute, I remember hearing an expert declare that he was expecting COVID-19 to get less deadly over time.  Unfortunately, I don't know what press conference it was (I'm not sure if it was the Robert Koch Institute — it might also have been the Charité university hospital) and cannot find such a stated expectation on the internet.

Why would an expert express this expectation?

Is it because we're heading toward summer (at least where most COVID-19 cases have been reported), or is it a standard pattern, perhaps either due to people's immune systems or due to the virus evolving and becoming weaker? 
","while the data are much too sparse and noisy to give an answer about what is happening to covid-19 is virulence  the technical term for the  deadliness  of an infectious disease , or to forecast what will happen to its virulence in the future, there are indeed theoretical reasons that one might expect the virulence to decline in the future.  there is an entire theoretical literature on the evolution of virulence  e.g. see read 1994, or see wikipedia   robert may and paul ewald are two researchers who contributed seminal ideas. the basic idea is that infectious  organisms   including viruses  may face a tradeoff between their ability to produce lots of infectious particles  e.g. by replicating faster within the host  and the length of time that they can stay in the host before it dies or activates immune defenses sufficiently to end the infection. in this case, some intermediate level of virulence may evolve.  evolution of virulence in ways predicted by the theory has been observed in the real world in such diseases as myxomatosis  a viral disease of rabbits . the theory has also been suggested to apply in hiv and syphilis.  the actual forecast can depend on many details of the biology and epidemiology of a particular organism. if covid-19 happened to have a higher-than-optimal virulence in humans at the time of emergence, we could expect its virulence to decline over time. it could also decline if epidemic control was applied in such as way as to differentially affect more-virulent strains  this has been suggested by tang et al. on the basis of the pattern of mutations in different strains, although their logic has also been criticized on twitter by an expert in genetic epidemiology, and now by a more official rebuttal by mclean et al.  with some back-and-forth discussion between the authors and critics .  this explanation does not include the possibility of host evolution, which is theoretically important but not really relevant to covid-19  mdash  it would only happen over many generations, and only if the epidemic was so severe that it was a significant overall cause of death or failure to reproduce ...     tang et al.  on the origin and continuing evolution of sars-cov-2 , national science review, nwaa036, http://doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwaa036 . read, andrew f.  the evolution of virulence.  trends in microbiology 2.3  1994 : 73-76.

"I'm researching options strategies and I started paper trading a $SPY options. Here's my strategy:

Set up a strangle 5% above and below the market price expiring a month from the day of trade. 12 contracts total. 

On Feb 20th, I looked at the cost of that setup:

Actual price of the stock ($SPY) = $336.40
Sell a Call 5% above the market (SPY200320C00355000) = $0.13 x 100 x 12 = + $156.00
Sell a Put 5% below the market (SPY200320P00319000) = $1.42 x 100 x 12 = + $1,704.00
So on Feb 20th, I would have received $1,860.00 for selling those options.


A month later, the idea is that one of those options would be worthless and the other one cheaper than the price paid (of course this was not the case with the current market/Covid-19)

On Mar 20th, I would have to pay back

Current price of the stock ($SPY) = $244.41
SPY200320C00355000 is now worth $0.01 = $12
SPY200320P00319000 is now worth $77.10 = $92,520.00


leaving me with a total of $ -90,660.00

Although it is clear that this strategy backfired given the current situation, I would like to understand if my calculations are right. 

More specifically, do I have to consider the fact that for every point that an index option goes beyond the strike, I will have to pay/earn $100? If this is the case, I would have to pay an additional 9,200 per contract (?), or $110,400

Since starting, I learned that an Iron Condor is much more secure than a Strangle and I'm planning to paper trade that strategy for a while.
","i think there is a few things you may be misunderstanding about selling a strangle.   first:     a month later, the idea is that one of those options would be worthless and the other one cheaper than the price paid  of course this was not the case with the current market/covid-19    the ideal scenario behind selling a strangle is that both options expire otm, as they were otm when you sold them to begin with  in your example, on february 20th . this would result in you keeping all of the premium you initially received, the  1860.00  not including commissions associated w/ selling these options, which can vary depending on your account, but we will assume no commissions for the sake of the theoretical scenario .   second part:     more specifically, do i have to consider the fact that for every point that an index option goes beyond the strike, i will have to pay/earn  100  if this is the case, i would have to pay an additional 9,200 per contract    , or  110,400   one, spy is not an index and if you wanted to sell options on an index, you could simply sell them on  spx. two, i think you are neglecting the fact that movements in the underlying are not the only factor that affects the value of an option, you also have time, and volatility  in a simplified sense  that affect the value of the option you sold. so you can not simply just use this rule of thumb without taking these into account, unless you are saying you are only concerned with what the price the option is on the day of expiration. in this scenario, then yes you would be only concerned with the difference between the underlying, and the strike price of your option.   so regarding the 319 put that was sold at  1.42 a contract, then on the day of expiration  march 20th  this put would be worth  74.59 a contract, and in your example, this could either get exercised against you  if you let it  and in that case, you would have to buy 100   12   1200 shares of spy at  319.00 which would cost:    319.00   1200    382,800 and then your position is actually currently worth  244.41   1200    293,292 so your loss would be:     293,292 - 382,800     1860    -87,648  recall the  1860 in premium you received initially   or more commonly, you would have to buy back the option to close out the contract  since you sold to open the contract , which would cost:  74.59   100   12    89,508. note that the call would expire otm  worthless  and you do not have to buy it back. but, recall that you initially received  1,860.00 in premium when you sold these two contracts, so your total loss is:  87,648.

How concerned should I be -- how does COVID-19 compare to the flu?,"concerned.  stay on top of cdc updates and guidance, as well as from state and local health departments. take the time to sit down and plan for what you will do if local transmission of the virus occurs in your city.  even the experts are not completely sure what is going to happen.   it is hard,  said dr. stanley perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the university of iowa, who described receiving a text message from his son asking whether he should stock up on canned goods.   i would be inclined not to,  perlman said.  we know from other cases that it actually tends to make things worse, because people stock up and then we do not have anything.   covid-19 appears to be more fatal than the flu, with some studies pegging covid-19 is fatality rate at around 3.4 , while the flu is fatality rate is less than 1 . still, experts anticipate that covid-19 is mortality rate will fall when more people with mild symptoms are diagnosed with the virus. typically, the sickest people tend to seek health care treatment first. compared to past coronaviruses, such as sars and mers, however, most covid-19 cases are mild.     for most people, it is going to mean no disease or a mild illness,  merson said. unfortunately, that mildness could also explain why covid-19 is spreading more rapidly than highly fatal diseases do. hiv, for example,  was very fatal, but hard to transmit,  he added.",28
What is the U.S. government doing to combat the virus?,"at the moment, the federal government is doing a lot of warning. the cdc has produced two dozen guidance documents for hospitals, instructions for preparedness and infection control. crucially, they are offering guidance on preserving personal protection equipment -- like masks and gloves -- in a recognition that a widespread outbreak is likely to impact already-low supplies. the trump administration has created a task force to oversee the response, led by health and human services secretary alex azar. but the administration has not named a coordinator to oversee a whole-of-government response, similar to what the obama administration did during the 2014-2015 ebola outbreak in west africa. in other words, there is no one person whose full-time job is to oversee the government is response. president trumpdonald john trumpwapo: trump allegedly asked fauci if officials could let coronavirus  wash over  us kansas supreme court upholds order banning religious services of over 10 people biden wins alaska primary more plans to hold a press conference on wednesday at 6:30 p.m. et alongside members of his coronavirus task force. his administration has requested  2.5 billion in emergency funding, but even republicans have been skeptical that that is enough to handle a widespread outbreak. senate democrats on wednesday said they would seek  8.5 billion in funding. on a state level, hospitals and public health officials are preparing for a growing number of cases. state health directors happen to be in washington this week for an annual meeting, and many spent wednesday walking the halls of congress, lobbying their members to support funding. at home, those officials are working to make sure their hospitals have the capacity they need to handle an outbreak -- enough beds, enough equipment and protective gear, enough laboratory capacity to test samples they take from potentially infected victims, and enough people to run the tests.  we are starting to work with hospitals and ems systems initially to make sure that they have all the capacity that they need,  shah said of maine is preparations.  the public should appreciate that hospitals are used to taking care of sick people. that is what they do.  what are the broader risks, beyond the virus  we have already seen the virus is impact in china, where factories and stores closed for days or weeks and cities have been quarantined to stop its spread. other countries may follow china is lead. frieden said the outbreak is likely to cost at least  100 billion to combat globally -- and maybe ten times as much, if things spiral out of control. but as in other outbreaks, the fallout is going to extend beyond immediate health concerns. when ebola broke out in west africa, more people died from other, treatable diseases -- malaria, cholera, even hiv -- because the health systems shut down. in this case, china is a major source of the generic drugs used in the united states, for everything from hypertension to diabetes. the virus is likely to impact supply chains, making scarce drugs that are completely unrelated to the coronavirus. experts recommend keeping a three-month supply of any prescription drugs you take on hand in case of that disruption.  the chinese manufacturing issue will affect us,  says michael osterholm, who directs the center for infectious disease research and preparedness at the university of minnesota.  we will have a major shortfall between what will be needed and what will be available.  personal protective equipment, like masks and gloves, are already in short supply after a particularly bad flu season. manufacturers are rushing to fill the gaps, but that takes time, and global demand is growing. the department of health and human services said it has a stockpile of about 30 million masks, but says it needs 300 million to protect front-line health care workers. those workers, who treat patients, would be most at risk of contracting the virus  more than 3,000 health care workers have been infected in china already. the broader economic impact is also unknown, though mark zandi, the chief economist at moody is analytics, said in a note to investors wednesday that the odds of a recession in the first half of the year now stand at 40 percent, twice what he predicted a few months ago.  if it is a pandemic, if it does show up in europe and the united states, then that is the prescription for a global and u.s. recession,  he said. the dow jones industrial average and the s p 500 are both off more than 6 percent in the last two days, the worst two-day drop in years. there is a decent chance that major sporting events and public gatherings will be delayed or canceled. a major trade show, the mobile world congress, has already been canceled in barcelona, spain. soccer games have been canceled in italy, and political demonstrations are temporarily banned in seoul, south korea. the organizers of the tokyo olympics, set for later this year, have insisted the games will go on. but a former top international olympic committee official, dick pound, cast doubt on those plans on tuesday, saying the organizers had about a three-month window in which to decide to pull the plug. the last time the olympics were canceled was in 1944, when games scheduled for italy and london were

I am a computer scientist looking for a mathematical approach towards understanding the mutational parameter space of viral protein sequence data, for example through a mutational correlation matrix between vaccine and wild type protein sequence. This may have application for example to COVID-19.
","there is not a vaccine for any coronavirus, and your question is generally about targeted attentuation, which is a complex area.   the basic building blocks for any vaccine development is virological understanding of the proteins involved in pathogenesis. i will focus on covid-19 as an example here.  the majority of bioinformatics work is based around the spike protein as is wetlab vaccine development. this gene is immediately after the 20 kb of orf1ab, including the rna dependent rna polymerase, its around 3.5 kb but it might be a bit bigger. the spike protein is a major b-cell  antibody  antigenic determinant and the cellular receptor sites are located within it. your bioinformatics could ultimately focus on targeting these specific sites, in particular using antigenic  antibody  prediction algorithms.   first you need some basic biology of spike and hydrophobicity prediction is a good starting point such as tmhmm here and consider the sars spike protein structure for example here. once you have a handle on those structures antigenicity scanning would be a next phase analysis and possibly homology modelling. this is because covid-19 and sars are closely related, but there are key differences. you finally consider the full range of amino acid mutations in current epidemic via ncbi.  at this point you would target a specific vaccine design strategy and have a clearer understanding on the approach you wish to take. good luck  ",15

"I'm looking for biological datasets with specific properties that are available for me to analyze. Informally put, I have a hammer and I am looking for a nail. That is to say, I have an algorithm and I am looking for suitable data to test if it can tell us anything interesting about biology. Let me start by characterizing the properties that I'd like this data to have.

Math Properties

The data must be representable as signed directed graphs, which in less formal terms means that I am looking for a network where the connections between the nodes are arrows with a +/- sign associated with them. 

The signed property of the edges must represent a property of the relation between discrete objects that only takes on one of two values. One way to get signed values from quantitative data would be to use the sign function, keeping only the relations whose sign of the quantitative variable were not equal to zero. Another way is to encode Boolean values, where False is - and True is +. I'd like to further clarify that the data should not only conform to this criteria, but should have instances of both positive and negative paths within the data.

The directed property of the edges mean that we care to distinguish 'A relates to B' from 'B relates to A'; order matters. Both, one, or neither of these relations can hold in these networks between any two nodes A and B. 

Data Properties

The data must be analyzable in the sense that I can obtain the data in a form where I can either (1) immediately analyze the data or (2) transform/manipulate the data into a form that I can analyze. As a computer programmer, I'm likely to be able to find packages for (or code for myself) moderately arbitrary transformations as long as they are computable and interpretable. That is to say, in your answer I would like you to not worry too much about whether you have a ready-to-use software solution for analyzing or transforming the data. What I would like considered is whether there is (1) a direct download for a/the datafile(s) or (2) an application programming interface (API) for downloading the data in either pieces or as a whole. 

Preference will be given to answers that do not cost money, and do not require creating accounts (although either are acceptable). 

All else being equal, I'd prefer larger datasets (n > 1000) over smaller ones. 

Preference will also be given to answers where the dataset has additional variables are available on the vertices. For example, if the vertices represent genes, then additional variables on the vertices would mean more data is available that describe those genes.

Academic Properties

The dataset(s) should be citable.

Examples

While I'm open to other biological subjects, there are two biological topics that I feel should be representable in the mathematical way I've described above.

The first is gene regulation data. The vertices would be genes, and for any two genes A and B we could have any of the following relations


Gene A downregulates Gene B
Gene A upregulates Gene B
Gene B downregulates Gene A
Gene B upregulates Gene A


The second example I've thought of is in biological signaling as the signals are sometimes directional (sender to receiver) and might have some sort of sign (turn on/off, increase/decrease).

Bonus points if the data is topical (COVID-19/coronavirus-related for example).

Data Sources

I've downloaded a few datasets from BioGrid, but I didn't see the kinds of mathematical properties I was looking for in those datasets. If there are datasets here that you think meet my criterion, please mention them.
","while this does look like a very nice approach, i would actually argue that there are  almost  no biological datasets, that can be directly used for your algorithm - you can only do a sort of meta analysis using results/predictions based on other datasets.  the reason for this is that the nature of a signed graph requires you to look at effects that can have opposite directions, which in biology pretty much restricts you to regulatory functions . the problem with that is, that is nearly impossible to directly measure regulatory effects. in all cases i am aware of, one has to measure the magnitude of an effect under different conditions and then calculate regulatory interactions based on that data.  this means any set of regulatory interactions you can put out into your network is already based on a given analysis with inherent assumptions and  potentially  biases.   this does not make the approach impossible, but i do think, it is something you need to be aware of, especially if you want to use multiple datasets.  as for actual datasets that would fit well:   transcription factors have already been mentioned in another answer other regulatory effects on transcriptions  promoters / enhancers  may also work, though in this case the  class  of the objects effected  genes/mrna  is different than the effector another type of biological network that might fit are metabolic / enzymatic pathways. for these you could either also look at regulatory interactions  which again may be tricky because both proteins and metabolites can have regulatory effects  or maybe also directly at metabolic flow: in this case nodes in the graph would represent metabolites and edges reactions that produce or consume them. the kegg database has large numbers of metabolic pathways for many different species.      i was trying to think of other things, but presence/absence of a signal probably does not fit and neither does classification into strong/weak signals  i.e. interactions  ",131

What exactly does it mean to flatten the curve?,"flattening the curve refers to the rate at which people are getting infected. without intervention, the number of individuals who contract covid-19 rises exponentially, which means it doubles at a constant rate -- in this case, every three days. at such a rate, the number of infected individuals will overwhelm our hospital system, because we simply do not have enough hospital beds and respirators to treat them all. the united states does not even have enough protective equipment at present to protect its own health care workers.   doing the math, if one person is infected with the virus on jan 1, with the number of people infected people doubling every 3 days, then by march 31, over 1 billion people will have become infected. with the world population being around 7.8 billion, it would only take until april 9 for all of us to be infected.  the situation in italy has shown us that, without enough equipment, hospitals will be compelled to turn away some of the most infirmed among us, resulting in increased fatalities.   staying home does not prevent you from contracting the virus down the line, but from contracting the virus and overwhelming the medical establishment now. postponing exposure buys time for the scientific and medical community to develop effective treatments or a vaccine to minimize or protect against infection.",30

"My cat (approximately 16 years old, short hair, no specific breed, indoor cat) has been vomiting pretty much every day (sometimes multiple times) for almost a month.

She had a scare with her kidneys about 2 years ago (elevated results of urea and creatine) and has had blood tests regularly since but her levels fell and have been good ever since.

Her brother passed away a few years ago from stomach cancer, and he showed similar symptoms in the beginning but when we've taken her to the vets they've done X-Ray and ultrasound and other than a slight thickening of the stomach lining couldn't see any lumps or anything out of the ordinary. She has also had blood tests and everything looks fine, very good kidney results, no sign of liver issues, no sign of diabetes.

She's been on antacids and laxatives from the vet (as much as we can get in her, she's not good with meds and gets very distressed) but they don't seem to be having any effect.
When she's been in to the vets they sometimes give her an anti-nausea injection which stops her being ill for a few days and then it starts up again.
She's also had antibiotics, dewormer, B12 and a steroid injection at various times. Any improvement is only temporary for a few days and then she starts vomiting again.

She's a fussy eater and she gets dry food (Purina One, various flavours), tuna and white fish. Also occasionally ham. She won't eat much else. She gets sick mostly in the morning and we suspected Bilious Vomiting Syndrome, but she already has food down through the day and gets other regular food throughout the day too, including late at night and that hasn't improved anything.

Most days she might be sick once (and it tends to be thick and dark brown, occasionally with food in or clumps of hair but mostly liquid) but sometimes it's two or three times.
She's otherwise eating fine, drinking and urinating a normal amount and pooing regularly (not sure the laxative is making any difference).

The vets seem to be a bit stumped and just keep telling us to give her the laxatives / antacid but there's obviously something else going on.

The only major change recently is that we were giving her a glycosamine and mineral supplement for arthritis which we were mixing with milk to get her to take it as it was the only way to guarantee she'd take it all. We ran out of the first course a couple of weeks before she started getting sick and didn't get any more before she got ill, so it's been about six weeks since she had the supplement or any milk.

We're really worried but don't know what else to do. Everything is also complicated by the fact we're in the UK and the country is on lockdown because of Coronavirus so while the vet is still open it's not easy to get an appointment.

We're waiting on a stronger antacid from the vets and we're going to try to give her exclusively white fish for a few days to see if diet is contributing (but it's the same diet she's been on for years).

Any ideas what it could be or what we could try next?
The fact she seems to be in good health (particularly for her age) is what's confusing us as all the things we've seen that fit have a list of other symptoms that she just hasn't got.
","never give your cat milk cats and all other adult mamals are unable to digest lactose it makes them and many of us ill.  the negative effect of giving milk is most likely stronger than the positive effect of glycosamine and the mineral suplement.  as elmy say in her answer if the vomit is dark it might be internal bleeding so you will need to take your cat to the vet for diagnosing and treatment of this.  giving white fish is a good idea and you can use the juice from the white fish and mix glycosamine and mineral suplement into this,to get the juice out of the white fish you need to do as follows.  use one of your smallest pots add the white fish it is best if it have been frozen add a couple of spoons of water and slowly heat until the water boils,use a fork to split up the fish so it gets heated evenly use little heat you need to keep the water/juice.  you can use a strainer to remove the juice or you can use the fish and juice as it is,cool it down and mix in the glycosamine and minerals hopefully your cat will eat it.  as other mention in the comments giving only white fish over time is not good,and it will lead to lack of essensial nutrients so you need to go back to normal food after two days even if your cat manages to keep the food down.

"I am curious if there has ever been a (modern) clinical study where a healthy volunteer was purposefully infected with a pathogen in order to test the effectiveness of a therapeutic or preventative measure (like a vaccine)?

If not, would the FDA allow for ethical exceptions in cases where there is an extreme case of urgency (like in a pandemic)?

Obviously these would be willing volunteers who signed waivers, etc. So Nazi experimentation, the Tuskegee trial, and other studies without total consent from the participants wouldn't qualify here.

Edit: Self-experimentation wouldn't qualify here either because the bioethics of self-experimentation are different than testing on others. 
","one can not easily separate ethics from how biology is done, as much as some people have tried.  though i suppose some have made bioethics into a separate and successful media career, so it can be done in that way.   in addition to the comment-answer about the tuskegee study, nazi doctors in germany performed experiments without consent, which included infecting concentration camp prisoners with the bacteria that cause tuberculosis.  your question is about volunteerism, however, and the victims of the united states and nazi germany did not give full -- or any -- consent to experimentation.  in this week is issue of nature, there is a news article which interviews bioethicist nir eyal about a recent preprint, of which he is a primary author.   in this interview and in the preprint, your very question about coronavirus vaccine research, specifically, is discussed, as it concerns the matters of consent, ethics, and safety of doing accelerated biological research about this virus in a time of emergency.  in answer to your first question about modern clinical studies, dr. eyal notes:    are there any precedents for infecting healthy people with a pathogen     we do human-challenge studies for less deadly diseases quite frequently. for example, for influenza, typhoid, cholera and malaria. there are some historical precedents for exposure to very deadly viruses. the thing that demarcates the design that we propose from some of these historical instances is that we feel there is a way to make these trials surprisingly safe.   as an example, there was a challenge trial for malaria performed in 2012. healthy individuals were bitten by mosquitoes carrying the malaria parasite and then treated with antimalarial therapies.   clinical trials are done under the aegis of government agencies with review and approval processes, some of which are described on the fda web site. irbs or institutional review boards provide oversight:    under fda regulations, an irb is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects. in accordance with fda regulations, an irb has the authority to approve, require modifications in  to secure approval , or disapprove research. this group review serves an important role in the protection of the rights and welfare of human research subjects.

"To break the title down into parts: 


There exist serology tests that detect the amount of an antibody (Ab)
against a specific pathogen/antigen.
Every human produces their own Ab for a specific antigen by
(relatively) random combination of different gene segments in their B
cells, until one that recognizes the pathogen is found and produced
in massive amounts.
One portion of every Ab is constant, whereas the portion that
recognizes the antigen is variable. Even for antibodies (in different
humans) that recognize the same antigen, albeit to a lesser degree.


What exactly does an antibody titer/serology test detect in the blood so that it can accurately measure the amount of antibodies against a specific antigen? I am assuming they use antibodies against the antigen-binding/variable portion of an antibody. But if the variable region differs from person to person, how can a universal antibody (to be used in serology tests) against it be generated? 

Is the variable region not that variable, so that any lab-generated antibody against any functional antibody against a virus works well enough for an accurate measurement of antibodies against that virus? But even so the concept sounds hard to believe since even a single antigen can have multiple epitopes, and one person might have an Ab for epitope 1 of antigen X, while the other would have an Ab for epitope 2 of antigen X. And they would still be immune to the same virus, while a universal Ab titer test for the virus would be unable to detect antibodies from one of them.

Do they perhaps employ multiple lab-generated antibodies against most of the possible variations of human-generated antibodies in the tests?
","specific antibodies are typically detected using elisa.  the way you make a test for an antibody to a particular pathogen is not by using secondary antibodies to the specific part of the target antibody, but by using the antigen.  different kits work differently, but the general idea is that you have antigen stuck to a surface, you put the sample on that surface. if there are antibodies to the antigen, they stick to it. then you wash everything away and add a tagged antibody that binds to generic human antibodies.  see also http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/new-blood-tests-antibodies-could-show-true-scale-coronavirus-pandemic ",94

Is it best to cancel routine doctor and dental appointments?,"federal health officials are asking americans to stay home as much as possible and cancel any elective surgeries. some local and state governments have implemented stricter rules.    if it is possible to keep your appointment and speak with your provider over the phone or video, you should. however, if you cannot speak with a provider remotely and are able to reschedule your in-person appointment for a later date, you should.",99
Can someone who has been quarantined for COVID-19 spread the illness to others?,"quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness  symptoms  from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. for covid-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. someone who has been released from covid-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.",40
How does the virus spread?,"coronavirus spreads from person to person by droplets from the nose or mouth from coughing or sneezing. people can also catch it by coming into contact with contaminated surfaces or skin. the who says  other people then catch covid-19  coronavirus  by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth . this is why people are being encouraged to regularly wash their hands with soap and to not go too near to people who have it.  it is very unlikely it can be spread through things like packages or food , according to nhs advice.",44
Is the presence of a fever always the first symptom of a coronavirus infection?

"Breaking news


  US President Donald Trump has announced sweeping new travel restrictions on Europe in a bid to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
  
  In a televised address, he said travel from 26 European countries would be suspended for the next 30 days.
  
  But he said the ""strong but necessary"" restrictions would not apply to the UK, where 460 cases of the virus have now been confirmed.
  
  [...]
  
  Mr Trump said the European Union had ""failed to take the same precautions"" as the US in fighting the virus.
  
  A Presidential Proclamation, published shortly after Mr Trump's address, specified that the ban applies to anyone who has been in the EU's Schengen border-free area within 14 days prior to their arrival in the US.


N.B. additional reasons given in the US proclamation:


  The administration’s European travel proclamation notes that “the Schengen Area has exported 201 COVID-19 cases to 53 countries. Moreover, the free flow of people between the Schengen Area countries makes the task of managing the spread of the virus difficult.”


What has the (official) reaction from the EU been regarding this US action?
","there have been a number of reactions from the eu so far - some official, others not so much. i have decided, in the world of twitter diplomacy, to count tweets from ministers and current/former heads of government as official responses for this purpose. responses are in chronological order, culminating with the joint statement by president von der leyen and president michel.  the first response from a current or former head of government came from former finnish prime  amp  foreign minister, alexander stubb who tweeted at 5:18 utc:    any attempt to contain the  coronaoutbreak is welcome, but the  decision of  realdonaldtrump to exclude the uk from a european  travel ban is nothing short of irresponsible. viruses do not recognise  borders. decisions should be based on facts, not politics.   the european council president, charles michel, then tweeted his initial response at 6:12 utc, saying that    following the travel ban  realdonaldtrump announced, we will assess  the situation today.     economic disruption must be avoided.      europe is taking all necessary measures to contain the spread of the  covid19 virus, limit the number of affected people and support research.   former prime minister of romania  amp  current leader of the renew party in the european parliament, dacian ciolos, tweeted that    viruses know no borders or nationalities. nationalism  amp  blame games  are no antidote. this is a global crisis, which requires global  solidarity,  realdonaldtrump . containment measures are needed, but  not arbitrary ones. europe will be your partner, but not your  scapegoat.  covid19   speaking to bbc breakfast, british chancellor rishi sunak said that the uk had no plan to emulate the us travel ban.  i am aware the uk is no longer an eu member, but i feel this response is still relevant.     we have not believed that that is the right thing to do, the evidence  here does not support that.    what we are trying to do is contain the virus while recognising that  it is now likely that it will spread more significantly.   guy verhofstadt, former prime minister of belgium, tweeted at 9:51 utc that:    nationalism is not the answer to  covid19, because viruses do not care  about borders or nationalities. we are all in this together. we need a  european approach to save lives  amp  bold interventions to protect our  economy.   at 10:40 utc, an official joint statement was released by president ursula von der leyen and president charles michel:    the coronavirus is a global crisis, not limited to any continent and  it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action.    the european union disapproves of the fact that the u.s. decision to  improve a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation.    the european union is taking strong action to limit the spread of the  virus.

How fast does it spread?,"how fast does it spread   each infected person spreads to two or three others on average, researchers estimate. it spreads more easily than flu but less than measles, tuberculosis or some other respiratory diseases. it is not known if it spreads less easily among children, but fewer of them have been diagnosed with the disease. a study of 1,099 patients in china found that 0.9  of the cases were younger than 15.",44
"I was looking at H.R.748 - CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) Act on the Congress website. I was surprised to find that the bill originally passed the House on July 17, 2019. I found this strange because the Coronavirus was not known until the last few months of 2019.

I looked at the original bill from the house. It is fairly short and has nothing to do with Coronavirus, but instead talks about removing a specific tax related to healthcare.

I took a looked at the Senate amendment to the bill. It says, ""Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following:"" This is followed the very lengthy text of the CARES Act. It does not contain any text related to the original purpose of the bill.

Why did the Senate use this bill instead of creating a new one? What happened to the original? Since the Senate replaced it's text, can it no longer fulfill it's original purpose?
","the reason for amending this bill instead of the senate creating a new bill was to fulfil the requirements of article i, section 7, clause 1 of the constitution, also known as the origination or revenue clause, which states that all bills for raising revenue must originate within the house of representatives. note that despite the senate seemingly being able to dictate the content of the bill, the house still has to approve the amendment.  the senate has decided that it is legitimate to fulfil the letter of this clause, if arguably not the spirit, by replacing the entire text of a bill originating in the house with a bill for raising revenue. the constitutionality of this decision has been examined by rebecca m. kysar in her 2013 paper the ishell bill  game: avoidance and the origination clause. in chapter ii, subsection c2, she notes that while the supreme court has never ruled on this, several state courts and lower federal courts have condoned this interpretation.  the original bill is now one and the same as the cares act, and you are correct in saying that it can no longer fill its original purpose, as the original wording has been completely removed and replaced by the senate amendment.

What is this eight-week formula everyone keeps talking about?,"this is the formula to figure out if your loan forgiveness under ppp will be reduced. i like the us. chamber of commerce illustration for figuring this out. you take your payroll costs and multiply them by a fraction. the top half of the fraction has the average number of full-time equivalent employees  fte  per month for the eight weeks beginning on loan origination. the bottom half has either the average number of ftes per month from february 15, 2019 to june 30, 2019 or the average number of ftes per month from january 1, 2020 to february 29, 2020. seasonal employers use february 15, 2019 to june 30, 2019.",10
"A few years ago we wanted to open a new program that will be based on distance learning,  however, getting accredited for having a master degree program that is based on distance learning and not on campus is literally a bureaucratic nightmare.
First, no one allowed us to use Zoom, Microsoft Teams or other currently popular distance learning tools, second it should be some sort of  ""Moodle"" program with clear guidelines for each week. Third everything needs to be under guidelines of the Distance Education Accrediting Commission, in current COVID19 teaching organizational crisis we don't follow those guidelines at all.
I wonder what are legal repercussions for doing distance learning when you are not accredited to do one. Can our students with disability complain since when they needed this option we couldn't provide to them since our excuse was that we weren't ready or accredited to do so? And last but not least, can we legally organize accredited on-campus program but perform it online or using distance learning completely?
","edit: this answer is somewhat specific to the context of the covid-19 health crisis and about legal justifications for various exceptional teaching strategies being adopted by many universities all over the world these days. it is not clear if that is what you meant to ask about exactly. if it is not, please clarify.    the covid-19 situation and the way universities are responding to it is an illustration of the adage that  it is easier to ask for forgiveness than for permission . basically the situation is so unprecedented that universities are doing whatever they can to stay operational, and leaving legal questions for later. my guess is that these will all be addressed by governments, legislatures, and regulatory bodies at a later time when the people in charge emerge out of panic mode and have time for dealing with such issues.  at the same time, the question of legality is indeed significant, and people are in fact paying attention. for example, in the us, i have heard that the visas of many foreign students explicitly forbid  online learning . as a result, i have also heard  this is basically gossip and i can not confirm it or cite a reference  that some institutions are referring to their current mode of operation as  remote learning  in a euphemistic attempt to pretend that that is conceptually different from  online learning . silly  perhaps, but that is the kind of advice lawyers are giving apparently. similar fig-leaf, cya-style advice is being given about protecting your zoom class meeting with a password to avoid being accused of compromising your students  privacy. does that mean using zoom is technically legal in the sense of being fully ferpa-compliant  who knows - probably not. but at least we make an effort to minimize whatever legal issues we have time to think about and energy to do something about.  but the short answer is, in the academic context as well as other contexts having to do with civil liberties, restrictions on people is movements and many other aspects of our daily lives that are being disrupted, the law is lagging far behind. people in charge will do whatever they need to do without asking for permission, and ask for forgiveness later if they have to  they probably will not .

Should I wear a face mask?,"not unless you are the one who is sick.  the cdc does not currently recommend any healthy person wear a mask and doctors warn fiddling with putting on and taking off a mask could backfire by exposing your hands to your face.   surgical masks fit rather loosely around the face and are not constructed, nor thick enough, to prevent infection,  schaffner said.  while they could have a modest benefit, any protection they provide is likely more psychological than scientific. n-95 masks, which hospitals use, are expensive and are not easy to wear, meaning they are not a practical option for everyday use. as health officials have noted, masks should be reserved for the health care workers, not the general public.  in recent weeks, n-95 masks have grown so scarce that the white house is asking americans who have them, as well as construction companies, to donate them to hospitals, so that health care workers are not forced to treat covid-19 patients without a mask, which puts them at risk for contracting the virus themselves.   the other thing a mask can do is give you a false sense of security, and that is not helpful,  said dr. michael merson, a visiting professor at nyu is school of global public health and a professor at duke university. masks work better at preventing people who are coughing and sneezing from spreading respiratory droplets and infecting others, but  those people who are sick should probably be at home anyway.     ",16
Are people with disabilities at higher risk?,"most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from covid-19. some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.  people with certain disabilities might experience higher rates of chronic health conditions that put them at higher risk of serious illness and poorer outcomes from covid-19. adults with disabilities are three times more likely to have heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer than adults without disabilities.  you should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.",87

"I'm going to post a question related to the current events and I think it could be very interesting.

In the midst of the crisis with the coronavirus, Croatian capital of Zagreb was hit by a strong earthquake on March 22. Since a lot of people escaped their homes in panic, there were fears that the earthquake would cause an increase in the cases of coronavirus since people didn't obey the rules of social distancing when they escaped outside due to the earthquake.

The Director of the Croatian Institute for Public Health, Krunoslav Capak, said that they conducted some preliminary analyses that suggest that the earthquake didn't cause an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. The analyses are preliminary becuase the incubation period of the virus is known to be as long as 14 days, so it's possible that the effect is not visible yet.

Regardless of the incubation period length, I was confused by Capak's statement because I cannot think of a statistical method I would use to make that inference. Does anyone know what analyses was Capak referring to? What statistical analyses would be appropriate to determine if there was an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Croatia due to the earthquake?

The number of coronavirus cases in Croatia can be found here: https://github.com/viborccom/data/blob/master/covid-19/croatia/time-series.csv?fbclid=IwAR2ekRN44WnKwlTQJAgpfYyJTz01GedrqJupB28d-g_KoGBnroIGWt8Jb58
","you might wonder whether an increased infection rate during a short period could be observed in the figures of reports on infected cases or the death rate.  however, this is not feasible with the data available   the effect get is diluted the effect is likely to be very small in the observations  unless the infection rate is very large .    if there is an increase in transmission then this will occur only in a small group, which gets diluted by the larger total number of zagreb and the surroundings.  also the time of the event is only very short and the contact between people is very local. social distancing is nothe way to go , but it matters with which persons and how long you have contact.   complete strangers in a supermarket are much more a risk than your neighbors  if your neighbors got the virus than you are already at high risk to get the virus as well, being outside is not gonna change this a lot . there is a large multitude of ways how the virus can spread. if we are traveling a lot, moving around over long distances, then the virus is moving a large distance quickly and will infect a lot of people quickly. the local transmission is of less concern  in terms of speed of transmission, and flattening the curve, the local transmission is eventually determining how many people get sick. the long range transmission is determining how fast people get sick  .  ad hoc ergo propter hoc even if there is a change in the trend/growth in the number of infections or the number of death cases, then it will be very difficult to connect this observation to a specific event. there are too many variables that are changing such that it is not possible to draw strong conclusions about causal relationships based on correlations.  the current cases in zagreb and croatia are very small. so the number will be expected to rise, already without an earthquake. this rise will occur with lots of uncertainty  . the information and background information is so noisy that it is not possible to make a lot of sensible predictions.  see the past reports on the cases below. the curve is not a nice straight line and is varying in growth rate and bumpy. it is very difficult to make a specific relation between specific events and this curve. that is because the time between infection, start of symptoms, and start of registration/confirmation occurs with an unknown delay.   time delay also, there is a delay in reporting of the numbers. this makes the above effects count stronger. it will take two weeks before the effect of increased transmission is measurable. but at that time many more events have happened which may cause an effect as well. and also the time delay is a random value. what happens now in a single day, will not create a sudden peak of a single day two weeks later, but instead it gets spread out over multiple days and becomes less noticeable  and then there are also large high noise levels in the measurements which might be a fourth point .  denominator. furthermore, there is always a few weeks of delay in death registration and reporting. hence, the euromomo mortality figures for the most recent weeks must be interpreted with some caution.      a simple model that shows how the reduction in the long-range transmission is having a strong effect and going on the streets and have local community spread is slightly less worrisome. i used the code from this answer which made used of a  r 0  for short distance transmission and a  r 1  for long distance transmission. i did two computations, one with  r 1   0.25 , r 0   2.25  and one with one with  r 1   0 , r 0   2.5 . the total reproduction rate,  2.5 , is the same, but the models deviate quickly once the infection reaches the edges of the neighborhood.    in the netherlands the officials were counting on a very specific rise of cases in the intensive care. now... they are surprised that it did not turn out to be that specific number and it is a larger number than predicted  they were expecting 1600 people in the intensive care at some date, and not this is gonna happen a week earlier than expected   me... i am surprised that they are surprised about the number turning out to be different. these sort of predictions should have been made with a very wide confidence interval indicating that there is very little certainty about the forecasts.

1 Derivation of the LS estimator

1.1 definitions


Let's consider the dataset $D_T\triangleq\{y_0,\dots,y_T\}$ up to the observation horizon $T$, where $y_t\triangleq[S_t, I_t, R_t, D_t]'$ is the vector of the observed values at time $t$ for the variables $S,I,R,D$. Here $'$ denotes the transpose operation, thus $y_t$ is a column vector in $\mathbb{N}^{4\times1}$;
Let $\theta\triangleq[\alpha, \beta, \gamma]'$ be the generic vector of parameters. The prediction model $\hat{y}_t(\theta)$ is $(1)$, so
$$\tag{2}
    \hat{y}_t(\theta)\triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    S_{t-1}-\alpha\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N}  \\ 
    I_{t-1}+\alpha\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N}-\beta I_{t-1}-\gamma I_{t-1}  \\  
    R_{t-1}+\beta I_{t-1} \\  
    D_{t-1}+\gamma I_{t-1}
\end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots   
$$
with the convention that $\hat{y}_0(\theta)\triangleq 0$;
Let $V_T(\theta)\triangleq \frac{1}{2}\sum _{t=0}^T \|y_t-\hat{y}_t(\theta) \|^2$ the quadratic cost up to $T$. Here $\| \cdot \|$ denotes the euclidian norm. The least square estimator $\theta_\text{LS}$ of the 'real' parameter $\bar{\theta}$ is defined as
$$\tag{3}\theta_\text{LS}\triangleq \arg\min_{\theta \in \mathbb{R^3}} V_T (\theta)$$
i.e. the minimum for the cost $V_T$.


1.2 analitic solution of $(3)$ 

the idea to solve $(3)$ is to use the standard technique by solving with respect to $\theta$ the equation
$$\tag{4}\frac{\partial V_T(\theta)}{\partial \theta}=0$$
the solution is a minimum for $V_T$ since $(3)$ is a convex problem under mild assumptions regarding the dataset $D_T$ (invertibility of the next matrix $R_T$ defined below). In order to solve $(4)$, let's start by observing that the prediction model $(2)$ is linear in their parameters. In fact we can write that
$$\tag{5}\hat{y}_t(\theta)=\varphi_t \theta + y_{t-1} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0, 1, 2,\dots$$
by introducing the regression matrices in $\mathbb{R^{4\times3}}$
$$\tag{6}\varphi_t \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    -\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N} &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\ 
    \phantom{-}\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N} &amp; -I_{t-1} &amp; -I_{t-1}  \\  
    0 &amp; \phantom{-}I_{t-1} &amp; 0\\  
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; \phantom{-}I_{t-1}
\end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots$$
with the conventions that $\varphi_0, y_{-1}=0$. From $(5)$ it follows straightforward that the gradient of the cost $V_T$ is
$$\tag{7}\begin{align}\frac{\partial V_T(\theta)}{\partial \theta} &amp;= \sum_{t=0}^T - \frac{\partial \hat{y}_t (\theta)}{\partial \theta}[y_t-\hat{y}_t(\theta)]\\
&amp;=-\sum_{t=0}^T \varphi_t'[y_t-(\varphi_t \theta + y_{t-1})] \\
&amp;=\sum_{t=1}^T \varphi_t'[\varphi_t \theta - \Delta y_t] \\
&amp;=\left(\sum_{t=1}^T \varphi_t '\varphi_t\right)\theta - \sum_{t=1}^T \varphi_t'\Delta y_t
\end{align}$$ 
where $\Delta y_t \triangleq y_t-y_{t-1}$. If we introduce the matrix $R_T\in\mathbb{R}^{3\times3}$ and the vector $\tilde{\theta}_T\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
$$\tag{8}R_T\triangleq \sum_{t=1}^T \varphi_t '\varphi_t \qquad \tilde{\theta}_T\triangleq \sum_{t=1}^T \varphi_t'\Delta y_t$$
the gradient in $(7)$ gets the following final sintetic expression
$$\tag{9}\frac{\partial V_T(\theta)}{\partial \theta} = R_T\theta-\tilde{\theta}_T$$
now, by combining $(4)$ with $(9)$ and by resolving with respect $\theta$, we can finally conclude that the least square estimator that we are searching is
$$\tag{10}\boxed{\theta_\text{LS}=R_T^{-1}\tilde{\theta}_T}$$

2 Naive implementation in Python

2.1 dataset

I want to estimate $\bar{\theta}$ for the COVID-19 epidemy in Italy, so I've built the  dataset by retrieving from worldometers.info the number of infected $I_t$, recovered $R_t$ and dead $D_t$ individuals day by day. Since $S_t+I_t+R_t+D_t=N$ is costant in time, the number of susceptibles day by day is $S_t=N-(I_t+R_t+D_t)$.  

2.2 least squares estimation of the parameters

in order to compute $(10)$, we need: 


to build $\varphi_t$ and $\Delta y_t$. For the former we can use the definition $(6)$, for the latter we can observe that

to build $R_T$ and $\tilde{\theta}_T$. The idea to compute $(8)$ is to accumulate during the time the products $\varphi_t ' \varphi_t$ and $\varphi_t '\Delta y_t$.


After this 2 simple step the estimation is given by $(10)$.

2.3 simulation  

for the simulation we use the prediction model $(1)$ with the least squares parameters that we have just found. For the initial condition of the simulation I consider the situation where in the population there is only one infected individual that spreads the  disease to the other people.

$$\begin{cases}
S_{0}&amp;=N-1 \\ 
I_{0}&amp;=1 \\
R_{0}&amp;=0 \\
D_{0}&amp;=N-(S_0+I_0+R_0) \\
\end{cases}$$
here the starting number of dead individuals is obtained by imposing the costraint $S_0+I_0+R_0+D_0=N$.

I can't understand if somewhere I have made some mistake or if the estimation that I'm using cannot provide good predictions.

 text for   , , t 0, 1, 2, dots    2  also you compute the derivative   varphi  based on the matrix that contains values of  s, i ,r, d  that are the observed values, but   varphi  should relate to the modeled values.    3  i am not sure whether you can continue your attempt to solve this analytically after correcting those mistakes. it looks a bit like how people solve equations with the finite element method and potentially you could solve it in that way as well  but it will be an approximation in terms of polynomial functions, and is not exact .   another way to solve it is to put the equations as a function, and have some solver optimize it  you can have the solver estimate the gradient . you can read about that here: fitting sir model with 2019-ncov data doesn  39 t conververge  in addition: you can recast the equations into a single differential equation. for the sir model this is demonstrated here:  tiberiu harko, francisco s. n. lobo, m. k. mak exact analytical solutions of the susceptible-infected-recovered  sir  epidemic model and of the sir model with equal death and birth rates arxiv:1403.2160  q-bio.pe   the sird model is almost analogous. it is nearly the same model, with only the r split up in two. so you can use this differential equation to make initial estimates of parameters.     also  fitting this kind of data to some model might be a bad idea. the sir type of models are some sort of logistic growth type models where the growth starts approximately exponentially but eventually the growth rate decreases. it is due to such terms like  di/dt   i    factor   where the factor is decreasing as  i   and  r  and  d   grow  in the case of logistic growth the factor is  1-i , for the sird model it a bit more sophisticated but not much different .  however, in the case of the corona epidemic, you get a decrease in the growth rate for a multitude of reasons.   weather changes   r 0  is not a constant  spatial distribution  this virus spreads in from place to place, and should not be considered with compartmental models that assume homogeneous mixing  a person in milan is much more likely to infect their family, neighbors, co-workers than a random person in the rest of lombardy  stochastic time effects. the article that you refer to tries to bring autocorrelation into the mixture, but you also have some stochastic behavior, people are not gonna get sick exactly at the same time. some people will get sick earlier than others and this will be according to some function that increases in time and that will make an increase of cases or deaths that might appear as an exponential growth that relates to a transmission model, but it might be not.  sampling bias. we can also see rapid increase in the sampling due to biassed sampling. definitions of the disease are changing  this gave a rapid bump in the curve for chinese , tests might be limited  several countries are limiting their testing which might give false ideas of reduction in the growth of the cases , positive reinforcement  once people have discovered the disease suddenly many other cases might become assigned to the same cause, and this may potentially occur inaccurate because a single cause of death is not always possible to assign   the last to points sampling bias and stochastic time behavior might have occured in the outbreak of sars  2003  in amoy gardens where hundreds of people got sick in a very short time frame. instead of fitting a model to it, one could also assume that all these hundreds of cases were infected by a single person  and that might be a more likely scenario . possibly such a situation may have occurred in italy as well, an initial heavy seeding by unnoticed cases that is now spreading with some time effect and causes the initial exponential decrease  currently the growth looks more like a quadratic curve . last but not least, people respond to the virus which may cause it is spread to increase/decrease. currently heavy measures have been taken and this restricts to a large extend the ability of the virus to spread. you can not model this with a model that has parameters that are constant in time  well, you can, but the outcome will be meaningless    the logistic sir type models will interpret all those reasons for a reduction in the growth rate as a reproduction rate very close to 1 or a low population parameter  you fixed it at the size of the population under study, but this is arbitrary, and also not everybody is gonna be susceptible, possibly many people might have some sort of immunity and get little infected, e.g. a hoskin is effect or some other effect might make only/mostly the elderly population susceptible .  this makes the seemingly mechanistic model, meaningless regarding the parameters. the outcome will be unrealistic.

Can kids get coronavirus?,"yes, but kids rarely have severe symptoms.  reports from china include children who have contracted covid-19, but those children typically had very mild symptoms and the majority of cases were diagnosed in adults. severe complications from coronavirus, like acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock, are rare among kids. similar to adults, children with underlying health problems may be at increased risk risk for complications associated with covid-19.

"I came by some cash a year ago, so I put $20,000 in a Certificate of Deposit which will end this weekend (at about $20.5K). Now I'm wondering what to do with it. I don't really know much about investing, so I'm wondering what the most logical long-term move would be for me right now.


My bank currently has CDs from 6 months to 5 years, all at 0.75% interest.
But I've heard that investing in stock indexes is low risk over long periods of time. If I were to put this money in an index now (while the market is plummeting) would this be a smart way to start saving for retirement?
Or should I hold on to the cash and try to buy a rental property?
Or is there a fourth, smarter option?


Specific Goals [Edit]

I'm specifically looking for a low-risk, low-maintenance option that makes the most sense over a long period time (30 years-ish?). Stashing it away until retirement would be my first thought for the money, but I'm not sure if it might be smarter to keep it available just in case.

About me:

I'm in my 30s, living in the US. I don't own any property. I'm currently making below the poverty line, but I'm getting by. I have no debt. I have $2K in a savings account. I may be moving across the country for graduate school in a little over a year.
","if you do not expect to need the money for the next 30  years, the best thing you can do is invest in the stock market.   the return on investment for cds is abysmal. they are only a good choice if you need absolute certainty that your investment will not lose value  or, will not lose value too quickly after adjusting for inflation . real estate is risky, particularly on the small scale. a single stroke of bad luck can wipe out your entire investment. the stock market is also risky, but unlike with real estate, you have got enough money to mitigate that risk by spreading your investment  eg. with a mutual fund, an index fund, or simply buying a wide variety of stocks . expect your investment to lose value in the near future -- the market is way down, but i do not think it is quite hit bottom yet, and long-term fallout from the covid-19 pandemic will keep things unsettled for a year or more.

"I'm planning a trip to the Netherlands mid-April, and I've already made reservations. I understand that because of the current coronavirus pandemic, I may have to postpone my trip or cancel it entirely.

However, instead of deciding now, I'd like to decide later (in April) if I should continue with my trip plans or cancel it (depending on travel advisories issued by my country (India) and the Netherlands, which would apply at that time). Which requires that I proceed with my visa application now (as I must apply at least 15 working days earlier). I understand that it is quite likely that I may have to cancel or postpone my trip (the global travel situation seems unlikely to get better by next month, but I want to stay optimistic, or at least not regret that I could have applied for visa in March if situations in mid-April do get favourable for a trip).

My concern is if the current coronavirus pandemic can be cited as a reason for visa refusal by the Netherlands embassy. I.e., does the current pandemic increase the likelihood of visa refusal when compared to normal circumstances? Are there any rules in visa policy of Schengen Area that concern with situations like this?

UPDATE: To clarify, my concern here is if the current pandemic will increase the likelihood of visa refusal. (Whether or not I'll be able to travel to the Netherlands in April is a different issue). The reason I'm separating these two concerns is because with new EU visa rules, I may qualify for a long validity visa (as I've been issued multiple Schengen visas in past), so if in the unfortunate case I've to postpone my April trip, I can do so &amp; re-plan on a much shorter notice. Whereas if I don't apply for a visa now and do so later, I'll have to plan for weeks in advance again (as I must apply for a visa 15 working days / 3 weeks in advance).

UPDATE: If the Netherlands issues a travel restriction in near future, will that result in a visa refusal or application rejection?
","there are restrictions in place, but afaik no current restrictions for indian citizens/residents applying for dutch visa. on the other hand, the czech republic closed their visa processing centers in china and hong kong several weeks ago, effectively preventing residents of china from applying for a czech visa. it is at the moment difficult to predict what happens tomorrow or in the next days, but it is of course not impossible, that more schengen countries will follow and impose restrictions on visa issuance.  independent of the visa, it may also by mid-april be impossible to travel to the netherlands. several schengen countries have today or in the past few days established very strict travel regulations or bans, effectively preventing many or most tourists and visitors from entering.

"The US has enacted law H.R.6201 - Families First Coronavirus Response Act which seems to mainly tackle elementary/secondary students' food availability, but also expanded FMLA among other things. I've seen various posts on Facebook that are, at best, outdated or, at worst, straight-up false. Some of the posts I've seen state that the US is requiring 2-week paid leave. But the summary of the law makes it sound like that falls to the state's unemployment program. When reading the actual text of the law regarding paid leave, it states that the first 10 days are unpaid; any leave after that is paid. So what does paid leave look like then?

For example, my place of business is shutting down next week, March 30th, and maybe subsequent weeks. I'm told that I can use PTO (of which I have none) or draw unemployment. Assuming that COVID-19 cases skyrocket in my county and we shutdown for more than 10 days, do I start getting paid on Day 11?

To further muddy the water, there is an exemption for businesses with fewer than 50 employees. I think this replaces the previous exemption of businesses with more than 500 employees. 

If the above is correct, let's say my factory (in Kansas) has 150 employees, but is owned by a company (national, but headquartered in Michigan) with >>500 employees. The company is a subsidiary of a larger, international corporation (I have no idea how many are employed under the corporation). 

Do I still qualify for paid leave on Day 1? Day 11? Not at all (this is America; bootstraps etc)? 

Assume that I am a healthy, essential employee with no children. Why we're still shutting down despite being deemed essential is beyond me.
","the department of labor has a nifty q amp a page  questions 2 and 3 in particular . in short, private sector corporations are considered as a single employer and thus count each employee within the company. if the employee count is greater than 500 the corporation in question is exempt from paid leave due to covid-19  for what kind of coverage a smaller company can expect, this fact sheet also provided by dol states that:    generally, the act provides that employees of covered employers are eligible for:      two weeks  up to 80 hours  of paid sick leave at the employee is regular rate of pay where the employee is unable to work because the employee is quarantined  pursuant to federal, state, or local government order or advice of a health care provider , and/or experiencing covid-19 symptoms and seeking a medical diagnosis  or  two weeks  up to 80 hours  of paid sick leave at two-thirds the employee is regular rate of pay because the employee is unable to work because of a bona fide need to care for an individual subject to quarantine  pursuant to federal, state, or local government order or advice of a health care provider , or to care for a child  under 18 years of age  whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to covid-19, and/or the employee is experiencing a substantially similar condition as specified by the secretary of health and human services, in consultation with the secretaries of the treasury and labor  and  up to an additional 10 weeks of paid expanded family and medical leave at two-thirds the employee is regular rate of pay where an employee, who has been employed for at least 30 calendar days, is unable to work due to a bona fide need for leave to care for a child whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to covid-19.     to summarize, paid leave applies if the private sector employee shows symptoms of covid-19, is told to self-quarantine by health care provider, is quarantined by federal/state/local order, or if employee is taking care of a family member that qualifies for one of the above reasons or if employee is child ren  is stuck at home due to school/daycare closures related to covid-19.  federal employees are still covered by title ii of the family and medical leave act, which was not amended by the families first coronavirus response act.

"Sweden has adopted a far less radical set of policies in reaction to COVID-19 than most other European states. Many other European states are in ""lock-down"", with severe restrictions on people's free movement, with people being advised to only leave their homes for food/medicine. In Sweden, by contrast, people are largely carrying on with their normal lives.


  While every other country in Europe has been ordered into ever more stringent coronavirus lockdown, Sweden has remained the exception. Schools for pupils up to 16 years, kindergartens, bars, restaurants, ski resorts, sports clubs, hairdressers: all remain open, weeks after everything closed down in next door Denmark and Norway.
  
  As the rest of Europe lives under lockdown, Sweden keeps calm and carries on - The Guardian, March 28, 2020


What social and political factors underlie this decision, and why is it so dramatically different to other European countries response?
","the reason for sweden is rather hands-off approach compared to other european countries was summed up rather well by lead epidemiologist of the public health agency of sweden, anders tegnell, who said in an interview with cnbc:    my view is that basically all european countries are trying to do the  same thing -- we are trying to slow down the spread as much as possible  to keep healthcare and society working ... and we have shown some  different methods to slow down the spread,  ...  sweden has gone  mostly for voluntary measures because that is how we are used to  working, and we have a long tradition that it works rather well.   this tradition of  laissez-faire-ism  that tegnell talks about was explored by johan norberg in his 2013 essay how laissez-faire made sweden rich. this is quite long but well worth a read. notably, norberg argues that rather than sweden is economic and social successes being a result of the sap  managing to tax, spend, and regulate sweden into a more equitable distribution of wealth--without hurting its productive capacity , sweden is greatest successes both economically and socially  took place when sweden had a laissez-faire economy .  sweden is approach to the current pandemic, then, would seem to be influenced by the political traditions of its past. i should note that although tegnell is hopeful that the current strategy will be successful, he does not rule out the implementation of more stringent measures should the data suggest that the laissez-faire tactics are not working.  as far as social factors that have influenced sweden is response go, one such factor is how sparsely spread its population is. this article from our world in data notes how sweden consistently ranks near the top of metrics related to single-occupant households, and the country also ranks 50th out of 54th for population density amongst other european countries.  it is likely that another factor has been the reluctance of the government to negatively affect the economy more than is required. for example, although taking a hands-off approach with regard to restricting personal liberties, it has taken a far more active role in ensuring the continued functioning of business, and on march 27th announced that it will guarantee 70  of bank loans provided to companies that are experiencing financial difficulty as a result of the pandemic.  in conclusion, sweden is response so far seems to be a combination of the reluctance of swedes to accept restrictions on personal liberty - note the outcry by opposition parties when a proposal to rule by decree was announced, a tradition of past laissez-faire approaches, and distinct social factors that will potentially help provide a natural defence against the virus.

"Disclaimer: I am a scientist, but this is not my main field so sorry if I've not used the correct terminology at this busy time...

Since the coronavirus protein bonds with and gains entry to the cell by bonding to ACE2 receptor, does anyone happen to be currently working upon inhibition of the ACE2 receptor?

Obviously it's not straight forward just to use an inhibitor of some sort without accounting for side effects, but is this form of therapy a potentially practical avenue?

I anticipate that this relationship with ACE2 is why we get pneumonia with COVID19 since ACE2 is abundant in the lungs, heart and kidneys... And that perhaps it's why people with cardiovascular disease and problems have the highest mortality?

From my understanding, there would be potential cardiac and renal issues. Possibly the negative effects of inhibitors may be reduced or managed by IV infusion of angiotensin 1-7, or supporting drugs (I.e. a vasodilator) as ACE2 won't be able to work on converting angiotensin 2?

To anyone whom is working in this area specifically, what I am really asking is, is this a viable avenue to consider, as a management strategy to reduce spread of the virus in-vivo?

The infection route and effects make me wonder how many people that recover from COVID19 may unfortunately suffer later cardiological or renal issues due to damage in ACE2 expression within the lungs... And not just lung damage from the virus or resulting pneumonia. (I.e fibrosis of cardiac tissues, etc)

I've found this: https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijpep/2012/256294/ 
Which seems to suggest that it has been studied to an extent in animals, but find limited information.

*** Note I'm talking about ACE2 inhibition not ACE inhibitors that are often used in heart failure
","the problem appears to be that the sars-cov-2 virus binds to the ace2 receptor and carries the receptor into the cell where the rna of the virus is then released. because the cell now lacks ace2 surface receptors this leads to intracellular damage due to lack of inhibition of at1-r in the renin angiotensin system.   the cells that are damaged in the lung are deep alveolar cells that make surfactant and this collapses the alveoli causing acute respiratory distress syndrome. interestingly lung infiltrates are seen early in the disease hence the use in china of ct chest scans for screening before rapid pcr became available. ace2 are also found widely throughout the heart and gut the latter where it assists enzymes that are transporting amino acids. the ace2 receptor bearing cells are found in cardiac tissue, lung, gut, macrophages etc and the main clinical effect of their loss of function is to cause cardiopulmonary damage.  if you were to create a drug that targeted the ace2 receptor then you would be replicating the deleterious effect of the virus which inter alia blocks the protective effect of ace2 on pulmonary and renal damage.  there is been some experimental work showing that a fully humanised soluble ace2 receptor can bind to the virus and blocks entry into the ace2 bearing cells. it works like a neutralising antibody to the virus.   this treatment is currently awaiting chinese fda approval for clinical trials.  josef penninger  http://youtu.be/jaw6vbwtiaa ",66

"In response to the spread of COVID-19 disease, all Californians were ordered on 19 March 2020 to stay at home, except for such necessary errands as trips to grocery stores, pharmacies, etc. On 21 March the San Francisco Chronicle reported that about $11\,500$ tests for the virus have been completed so far with $1206$ positive results among them. 

Can anything useful be said about the prevalence of the virus in California based on these results? If (a) the 11500 tests were from randomly chosen Californians and (b) the tests were of ""gold standard"" quality, then prevalence would be close to $1206/11500 =  0.1049 \approx 10.5\%.$

However, according to the Chronicle article, guidelines have centered on testing people showing symptoms of COVID-19 disease, care workers who have had contact with COVID-19 patients, and people who have symptoms of pneumonia, but test negative for pneumonia. Moreover, tests are ""coming from a growing list of private companies, private labs, and public and private universities,"" so there is no way to know proportions of false positives and false negatives for any one test, let alone the overall rates for whatever mix of tests accounts for the 11,500 reported results.

In my answer below, I will extend my answer to this question to give prevalence values resulting from various assumptions about the sensitivity and specificity of the tests involved. I use the notation of that page. This analysis may help to answer the question for whatever population produced the specimens tested.

Additional answers are welcome, perhaps showing alternative methods or based on
additional information that may become available as the pandemic

Is it safe to eat takeout from restaurants? Can I get coronavirus through food?,"yes, it is safe to eat takeout.  there is no evidence to suggest coronavirus is transmitted through food, the cdc says. it is mainly spread through respiratory droplets.  even if coronavirus does get into your food, your stomach acid would kill it, said dr. angela rasmussen, a virologist at columbia university.   when you eat any kind of food, whether it be hot or cold, that food is going to go straight down into your stomach, where there is a high acidity, low-ph environment that will inactivate the virus,  she said.  but it is a good idea to disinfect the takeout containers, cnn chief medical correspondent dr. sanjay gupta said. coronavirus is a respiratory virus, and it is easy to touch your face without realizing it.  if you do not have disinfecting wipes, use your own plates or bowls to serve the food. just make sure to wash your hands after transferring food from the containers.",14
How did it start?,"the virus is one of the few that can be transmitted from animals to humans. it is believed to have originated in bats, which perhaps infected live animals and seafood sold at a  wet market  in wuhan, a crowded, not so sanitary dense marketplace. bats are also hosts for ebola, hiv, and rabies.    the first person who contracted the virus on december 1, 2019, had no connection to the outdoor market, making it unclear how he contracted it in the first place.     others who shopped there came down with viral pneumonia from covid-19.",12
"I have heard several times now, from both people I personally know and from others who have posted their stories online that they do not qualify for COVID-19 testing.

From the stories I have heard, to qualify you have to:
1. Had contact with a known case of COVID-19
2. Been to a country heavily infected with COVID-19
3. Have symptoms that have progressed to the point where hospitalization is required

We now have a reported 1339 cases in the US with likely many more undiagnosed by medical professionals or the CDC.

Why, when we are in a state of pandemic and all countries scrambling to get a handle on the virus, are clinics, primary cares, and even hospitals not administering tests to those who exhibit symptoms unless one of these other criteria are met?

With an incubation period of 2-14 days, it is entirely possible to have contact with someone who has it and not know you got it from them.
","there is yet another reason: a test can provide only a certain amount of information gain. if the probability to have contracted covid-19 before the test is too low, even though we know more after the test we may not be able to draw practical conclusions that are any different from the recommendations without test. in other words, if the recommendation goes from  stay at home and avoid contact to others  to  stay at home and avoid contact to others  the test would be wasted.  the covid-19 tests are not suitable for screening purposes  i.e. searching for infections among a population where infections are  still  very rare . they are to sort out who is infected and who is not among high-risk populations where 1 in 10  or more  are actually infected.     you may want to look at my longish answer to how accurate are coronavirus tests  for relevant background.    e.g., with the newly emergency approved roche test, we may say that a positive test result increases the odds of having covid-19 by factor of somewhere around 30 - 100, a negative result decreases the odds by a factor of 1/50 - 1/17.   if you are in a risk group with a prevalence of 8  , the pre-test odds of 8 : 92    increase to  240 to 800  : 92 or a post-test probability of having covid-19 of 70 to 90   with a positive test result, and decrease to 8 :  4600 to 1564 , i.e. the post-test probability of having covid-19 is somewhere around 0.5 to 0.2     these post-test probabilities allow practical conclusions: if you are negative, you are fine and can be let to meet the public, if you are positive you need to go to quarantine and/or treatment.   8   prevalence is my guesstimate for those who are currently  mar 15th  tested in the us  and incidentally, also in germany .  now consider the overall us population. with currently 1629 cases and a population of 328 mio., we would get pre-test odds of 1629 : 328 mio .   the test results change this to    positive result:  27700 to 162900  : 328 mio or a post-test probability of having covid-19 of 0.008 to 0.005   negative result: we do not even need to calculate this, because the pre-test probability was only 0.0005  , post-test probability is lower.   even if we assume that there is a dark number of yet unknown covid-19 cases, say, a factor 20 over the known cases, the post-test probabiliy after a positive test is about 0.2   to 1 .   what would be the practical conclusion  well, probably that the positive case should stay at home as much as possible and avoid contacts. certainly not that they can rely on acquiring immunity against sars-cov-2.  even for low risk groups who have flu-like symptoms but no known contact to covid infected people  or other high-risk situations  the pre-test probability of having covid is too low to allow the test to make a meaningful difference: after all, even if it is  only a common flu , they should stay at home, get well and not infect others meanwhile.  while the pre-test probability is likely to increase  because more people get infected , in order to keep the health system/hospitals working the recommendation will probably not change: stay at home in self-quarantine as long as the symptoms are mild, so that the health system is not burdened by cases that get well on their own.  we may also say that were the whole us population to be tested in that situation, the 32500 true cases of covid would be drowned in 3 - 10 mio. false positve cases.     328 mio - 1629     328 mio ",19

"I stumbled upon this boiled down news article which makes the statement that if we get the doubling time for coronavirus cases above the incubation period (5.8 days), we will be able to effectively ""flatten the curve"".

Could someone explain to me the logic behind that statement? Can't wrap my head around it. Even if the doubling time  is 6 days, in theory (I realise the curve will naturally flatten as a result of population size and number of people already infected) you're still going to see an exponential increases in cases (i.e. 50000, 100000, 200000, 400000...)
","one of the issues with covid-19 is the fact that it is transmissible even by people who are asymptomatic. you have probably heard about r0, which is the basic reproduction rate of a disease, that takes into account transmission modes and contact rate, among other things. i am not an epidemiologist, but i am operating under the assumption that someone who is obviously sick will infect relatively fewer people than someone who is asymptomatic, assuming similar contagiousness - the sick person should quarantine themself and clearly take measures to avoid spreading their sickness. a seemingly well individual, on the other hand, may not reduce their contact rate and unwittingly spread the disease.   under this assumption, consider what happens when the incubation time is equal to the doubling rate. suppose we have 1000 individuals who have the disease, but do not know it yet because they are still in the incubation period. 5.8 days later, there are now 2000 people with the disease, 1000 of which now feel sick, and 1000 of which still feel fine. those 1000 sick people quarantine themselves, dramatically lowering their rate of infecting others, let is say to 0 for the sake of simplicity. 5.8 days later, the 1000 asymptomatic people now feel sick, after having infected another 1000 people, although the 1000 already-sick individuals have not infected anyone else. at this rate, we have a linear increase in the number of cases, since old cases are quarantining themselves at the same rate new cases are spread - the number of people spreading the disease unwittingly remains constant   i have made several assumptions here, like that the transmission rate for asymptomatic individuals is higher than that of symptomatic individuals  although some symptoms, like cough, increase infectivity, and not all symptomatic individuals quarantine appropriately . i am also not sure this is really an appropriate use of  doubling time  - strictly speaking, if 1000 people quarantine, and 1000 asymptomatic people infect 1000 others, it is not a doubling of cases. the statement also seems a bit of tautological red herring - if you are able to lengthen the doubling time, you have already flattened the curve, regardless of the incubation period. but i think the general idea is that a longer doubling time can lessen the impact of asympomatic, but contagious individuals spreading the disease.

"While school’s out, can my child hang out with their friends?","  the key to slowing the spread of covid-19 is to practice social distancing. while school is out, children should not have in-person playdates with children from other households. if children are playing outside their own homes, it is essential that they remain 6 feet from anyone who is not in their own household. to help children maintain social connections while social distancing, help your children have supervised phone calls or video chats with their friends. make sure children practice everyday preventive behaviors, such as washing their hands often with soap and water. remember, if children meet outside of school in groups, it can put everyone at risk.  revise spring break plans if they included non-essential travel.   information about covid-19 in children is somewhat limited, but current data suggest children with covid-19 may have only mild symptoms. however, they can still pass this virus onto others who may be at higher risk, including older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions.

How concerned should I be -- how does COVID-19 compare to the flu?,"concerned.  stay on top of cdc updates and guidance, as well as from state and local health departments. take the time to sit down and plan for what you will do if local transmission of the virus occurs in your city.  even the experts are not completely sure what is going to happen.   it is hard,  said dr. stanley perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the university of iowa, who described receiving a text message from his son asking whether he should stock up on canned goods.   i would be inclined not to,  perlman said.  we know from other cases that it actually tends to make things worse, because people stock up and then we do not have anything.   covid-19 appears to be more fatal than the flu, with some studies pegging covid-19 is fatality rate at around 3.4 , while the flu is fatality rate is less than 1 . still, experts anticipate that covid-19 is mortality rate will fall when more people with mild symptoms are diagnosed with the virus. typically, the sickest people tend to seek health care treatment first. compared to past coronaviruses, such as sars and mers, however, most covid-19 cases are mild.   for most people, it is going to mean no disease or a mild illness,  merson said. unfortunately, that mildness could also explain why covid-19 is spreading more rapidly than highly fatal diseases do. hiv, for example,  was very fatal, but hard to transmit,  he added.",28
"Could one be injected with an infinitesimal amount of Covid-19 viral particles, in a way that it would trigger an immune response long enough before the virus overran the body? Could it be injected into tissue that was far enough away from the lungs, so that some immunity could build up before the virus reached the lungs?

I am talking about something similar to variolation, which was a method used to control the spread of smallpox. Material from smallpox sores (pustules) was given to people who had never had smallpox. This was done either by scratching the material into the arm or inhaling it through the nose.

People usually went on to develop the symptoms associated with smallpox. However, fewer people died than if they had acquired smallpox naturally.
","what you are describing is a live-virus vaccine. the only live-virus vaccines ever used were the early smallpox vaccines, which carried a significant risk of causing the disease rather than building immunity. even attenuated vaccines  using a live but weakened form of the virus  can cause disease  most cases of polio these days are caused by the oral polio vaccine. vaccines using inactivated viruses or virus fragments are strongly preferred.

"I have been an employee at the company for over 5-year and I had requested time off work (4-months) to do sabbatical with some travelling. It was granted by my line manager. The request was made in person and then finalised in email.

However, fast-forward to now and due to the coronavirus pandemic, I have had to return home early from my travels, at great financial cost. As such, I am keen to start working again as soon as possible and can do so from home with ease. FYI, before leaving I was working from home once a week anyway!

I having had a call with my line manager, he says it won't be possible to return before the original return date, almost 2-months away. I am certain that in any normal situation (e.g. sans corona) they would be pleased to have me back early. After all, there was a reluctance to let me go in the first place. When I pressed him on why, I was told my pay wasn't in the budget for April and due to corona they were already down in their P&amp;L.

However, the UK government is willing to reimburse companies pay 80% of people's wages if the coronavirus has stopped them from working, so this seems a weak reason.

Either way, this leaves me in a very strange situation: I am employee but I am not being payed.

Therefore my questions are as such:


Can my company legally stop me from returning to work, if it is not from something such as illness, etc? Alternatively, there is a mechanism in place that can allow me to return to work earlier?
If I am not allowed to return to work, what does this mean for my employment status? If I was unemployed I could claim certain benefits, however, I would consider myself employed so I feel rather in limbo right now!


Any advice on this would be REALLY appreciated.

TL;DR


I requested 4-months leave
I have asked to start again 2-months
early
I am being denied that
Do I have a right to start again early?/Are they obligated to allow me to return early?




Outcome

It seems that I am in a rather strange, but probably not entirely unique position, so I will detail some findings for those that might find them useful.

My employment status remains ""Employed"", as suggested in the answers. However, I wrongly assumed this excludes me from claiming Universal Credits. As I am not current earning I can still apply (in fact you can apply if you are earning, that just take this into accounts and give you less). Hopefully this is useful to someone else in my position.

Can high or low temperatures kill coronavirus?," generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods of time at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments. however, we do not have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point,  the cdc says.    the necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.   president donald trump suggested this coronavirus could subside by the warmer summer months, but scientists say it is too early to tell. and the fact that coronavirus keeps spreading in the southern hemisphere during its summer months suggests this strain might not succumb to warmer temperatures.    the short answer is that while we may expect modest declines in the contagiousness of  novel coronavirus  in warmer, wetter weather and perhaps with the closing of schools ... it is not reasonable to expect these declines alone to slow transmission enough to make a big dent,  wrote dr. marc lipsitch, director of the center for communicable disease dynamics at harvard is t.h. chan school of public health.",10
"I am confused about the needed ratio of bleach to water required to disinfect COVID-19 from surfaces.

The guide on CDC states that: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/home/cleaning-disinfection.html


  Diluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for application and proper ventilation. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted.  
  
  Prepare a bleach solution by mixing:  
  
  5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water or  
  
  4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water


This is a 2% ratio. My problem is that it is not clear what ""bleach"" means. Chemically I guess it's Sodium hypochlorite. What's not clear is that what is the strength of the solution I can buy in shops.

Wikipedia states that bleach in stores can be anything between 3-25%.

Does CDC recommend the final strength of Sodium hypochlorite : water to be 2% or ""bleach in stores"" : water to be 2% (which can be anything between 0.06% - 0.5%

","perhaps i can help answer your microbiology question which is really about sars-cov-2 which is an enveloped mrna virus. there is a lot of misunderstanding about sars-cov-2 and the medical disease it causes, covid-19. the confusion is understandable as this is a novel coronavirus with a high rate of transmission  amp  people around the globe are still in a learning curve about it. it is important to understand how to decimate sars-cov-2 whenever possible. i am an rdn  amp  years ago i went to grad school on an allied health traineeship thanks to citizens of the u.s.a. although now retired, as well as having been a clinician, i am a former prof. i believe in giving back to society which has supported me.  many pieces in the press unfortunately use terms of sars-cov-2 and then covid-19 interchangeably, which they should not. this adds to public confusion. keep in mind that disinfection in this instance pertains to decimation of the virus sars-cov-2 per se.  cleaning should precede disinfection. disinfection is biocidal elimination on fomite surfaces of microorganisms, in this instance sars-cov-2. after applying disinfecting dilution be sure to allow it adequate action time and then allow surface to air dry.  when cdc says to use  5 tablespoons  aka 1/3 cup  bleach per gallon of water  or  4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water  that is in effect 1000 ppm. cdc guidance assumes household bleach concentration to be 5-6.25 , even though most naocl manufacturers int the u.s.a. went to 8.25  back around 2012-2013. check any bottle you have  or box it came in  for the naocl concentration for that batch of bleach. when first manufactured concentration is higher, but over time actual available free chlorine level drops and adequate potency passed by 1 year out from manufacturing date. if stored at higher room temperature, cut that down to 6 months which is more realistic. adequate 1000 ppm of naocl for enough time  minimum 1 minute  can kill sars-cov-2. if the non-porous fomite surface happens to be a countertop where inadvertently later food might be placed on, then after first cleaning, then disinfecting, be sure to rinse with potable h2o, then use a sanitizing solution dilution and allow to air dry.  see:  covid-19 -

"I have been studying the Feynman path integral and its various derivations, and I've run into a bit of a problem. The standard Feynman path integral appears as follows:
$$
\int \mathcal{D}[x(t)]\exp\left(\frac i \hbar \int_0^t d\tau\ \left( \frac m2 \dot{x}(\tau) - V(x(\tau) \right) \right)
$$
Where the path integral is defined by passing the following into the continuum limit:
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty}\idotsint d^{n-1}x\ \mathcal{N} \exp\left( \frac i \hbar \sum_{j=1}^n \left( \frac m2 \left( \frac{x_{j+1} - x_j}{\Delta t} \right)^2 - V(x_j) \right) \Delta t \right)
$$ 
where $\Delta t = t/n$. In this form, we independently integrate each $x_j$ from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$, and hence there is no innate notion that the paths considered must be continuous; $x_{j+1}$ and $x_j$ can be as far apart as we please. 

In doing readings, I have found multiple sources that claim that the paths we consider are continuous, for example in this paper. In transforming to imaginary time ($-t \to -i\tau$), this claim makes sense, since discontinuities in the path will blow up the the sum and they will be exponentially suppressed. However, in the form presented above, I am not quite sure where and how we can make this claim.

I have seen the argument that paths that deviate greatly from the classical path will lead to extreme oscillatory behavior from our phase, and hence will be suppressed since they will on-average integrate to zero. However, I don't think I am satisfied with this argument to claim we must have continuity. This shows which paths contribute the most, but I don't think it rules out discontinuous paths. Does anyone have insight into this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
","the paths of a feynman integral do not always have to be continuous, and the first example that comes to my mind is the feynman integral in the feynman-vernon formalism, which is used to study the spin-boson model, among other things.  for the spin-boson problem, the  x t   paths written in your question, are discontinuous. if the spin in your spin-boson problem is a spin-1/2 particle, then  x t   will be either -1/2 or  1/2 at each time  t , and the feynman integral will be over all possible paths, of which i will give four examples below:     x t     -1/2 for all  t .  x t      1/2 for all  t .  x t     -1/2 from  t 0  to  t  5ps, and  x t    1/2 for the rest of the time.  x t     -1/2 from  t 0  to  t  5ps,  x t    1/2 from  t  5ps to  t  10ps, then  x t   -1/2 for the rest of the time.   if you allow all possible flips between spin-up and spin-down between  t 0  and the rest of your desired time for the feynman integral, there will be an infinite number of such paths.   the software feyndyn  feynman dynamics  can calculation such feynman integrals for up to 16 spin-1/2 particles  or 16 qubits, if simulating a quantum computer in the presence of noise  and more information about this whole  feynman-vernon  formalism can be found in this paper  i have given a free link to the pdf rather than the original journal, in case covid lockdown has caused you not to be on a campus where you can download papers easily .

"NOTE: Please do not delete this question.  It is not a personal health question.  The question has broad utility, in cases where others find themselves in social-distancing or quarantine with need for surface sanitizer, and their only available ingredients are water and powdered oxy-bleach.

I need a quantity of surface sanitizer to decontaminate boxes delivered to the house during the Coronavirus19 social-distancing period.  

CDC and WHO say 0.5% hydrogen peroxide solution will destroy coronavirus19.  And powdered oxy-bleach a.k.a. Sodium percarbonate contains 32.5% by weight of hydrogen peroxide, I'll call it roughly a third.

So to make a water solution of hydrogen peroxide using powdered oxy-bleach, I'm thinking I need to add enough powdered oxy-bleach (by weight) to equal 3 x 0.5% of the weight of the water. I.e, for a gallon of solution, 1.5% of 8.3 pounds, thus 0.12 lb, or ~2 oz.

A friend checked this and agreed, saying:
""A 0.5% H2O2 solution in water will consist of (per gallon): 0.42 lbs of H2O2 and 7.9 lbs of H2O. To get 0.42 lbs of H2O2 out of Oxy-bleach (32.5% H2O2), divide 0.42 by 0.325, which = 0.128 lbs or 2.0529230769 ounces...😁""

","yes, do use household dilute h2o2 but, in general, do not use commercial percarbonates powders as they can contain an additive to convert the friendly percarbonate into more powerful peracetic acid  paa . the latter allows the otherwise weak bleaching power of the h2o2 to compete with chlorine-based bleaching. however, this comes at a price  safety . hence, the dire warning labels, usually in at least two languages, on oxi-bleach and generic related products.  i quote myself on this subject:    sodium percarbonate is chemically just an addition compound of na2co3 and hydrogen peroxide.    also, while sodium carbonate and sodium percarbonate  basically na2co3 and 3na2co3.2h2o2  are often listed as the main ingredients in typical chlorine free bleach, an additive, taed, which acts as a key activator  see, for example  is not even listed on the label. tetraacetylethylenediamine is apparently commonly employed as a bleach activator in many laundry products  see this . taed reacts with h2o2 in alkaline conditions  referred to as perhydrolysis  creating, in part, peracetic acid. the latter paa is actually preferred over sluggish h2o2 for bleaching. in other words, it is not the h2o2 as the active bleaching agent, but paa created in situ. so, other than possibly misleading implying that eco friendly hydrogen peroxide is the active agent, it is, in reality, paa, a probematic compound with associated health concerns  see marquand, e. c.  et al. , 2007.  asthma caused by peracetic acid-hydrogen peroxide mixture . j. occup. health. 49  2 : 155-158. . here is a msds on an actual paa mix   76-61  water, paa 20-35 , 3  acetic acid and 1  h2o2  available at which is far from friendly but does eventually totally decompose into harmless o2, co2, h2o,...    as such anyone using a commercial percarbonate product should at least be aware of safety issues and that one is likely employing a peracetic acid mix.   however, such more powerful paa based mixtures do have their use and is recommended by the u.s. military as a chemical/biological warfare decontamination protocol  see  development of bicarbonate-activated peroxide as a chemical and biological warfare agent decontaminant  . so, it is up to the user to weigh the relative risks of the situation.

How is it transmitted?,"the first cases of covid-19 were believed to be linked to a live-animal market in china, but the virus has since been spreading from person to person.    person-to-person transmission is most likely between people in close contact, about 6 feet. when a person infected with novel coronavirus sneezes or coughs, respiratory droplets could land on people nearby or could possibly be inhaled by those people.    while the virus can be transmitted by touching objects or surfaces contaminated with covid-19, health experts do not currently believe that is primarily how it is transmitted.",2

"I need to cancel or possibly change an international flight on United with a non-refundable ticket (class T). When I log in to the app and hit cancel, the credit shown is the exact amount I paid for the ticket - $953.

I'm scared to hit the confirmation button. Will I get back a full credit of $953? Thanks!
","united airlines uses a  new money  concept for change fees.  basically this means that you can cancel your flight at this time and receive a  953 credit voucher. however in order to use that voucher at a later stage you will need to pay  400  new money   ie, the  400 can not come out of the voucher value , and then you will be able to use the full  953 value of the credit.  depending on when the trip is, you may want to wait until it is a little closer to the date to see if they add rome to their waiver list for areas affected by the coronavirus. if they do that you will likely be able to  at least  avoid paying the change fee. the refund amount/change fee will not change over time, so as long as you cancel at least a day or two before the flight there is no reason not to wait.

"The genome of Covid-19 was mapped in early Feb. The gene for a protein spike was used to produce these spike proteins. 3-D microscopy of this synthesized spike has been produced. Quoting McLellan from this article:


  ""the molecule looks really good; it's really well behaved; the
  structure kind of demonstrates that the molecule is stable in the
  correct confirmation that we were hoping for,"" McLellan said. ""So now
  we and others will use the molecule that we created as a basis for
  vaccine antigen.""


Also saying:


  In theory, the spike protein itself ""could be either the vaccine or
  variants of a vaccine,"" McLellan said. When you inject this
  spike-protein-based vaccine, ""humans would make antibodies against the
  spike, and then if they were ever exposed to the live virus,""


The article goes on to say:


  Their colleagues at the NIH will now inject these spike proteins into
  animals to see how well the proteins trigger antibody production.
  Still, McLellan thinks a vaccine is likely about 18 to 24 months away.
  That's ""still quite fast compared to normal vaccine development, which
  might take like 10 years,"" he said.


My question is: Why not inject, or drink, these spike proteins for immunity to Covid-19? Why expect an 18-24 month wait? The anti-body production response should occur(and be detectable) in days?
","vaccines need extensive testing before they can be used. there is essentially no medical intervention which requires more testing than vaccines, which are used in extremely large numbers of healthy patients.  generally this involves basic research, animal testing, phase i testing   is it safe in humans  at what dose   , phase ii testing   is it effective  at what dose  are there side effects   , and phase iii testing   is it safe and effective across all different subpopulations   .  as just one example of what could potentially go wrong: many/most covid-19 deaths involve cytokine storms which are, roughly, damaging inflammatory immune overreactions. priming the immune system could potentially worsen them and increase deaths by strengthening the immune response.  it does not seem likely, but this is why we test.

"Everywhere in the news we hear about numbers of corona-virus infections, deaths and recoveries.

In lots of the publications the numbers (especially the infections) are compared with previous days. Mostly the presented numbers are 'growth' of new infections in per cent and the total number of infections so far. Then the numbers of different countries are shown. 

I tried to get something out of these numbers (of infections) and realized that some important information is not told: the amount of tests done. And even further, who is tested? Which criteria? And this varies a lot between countries. Then there is the accuracy of tests. 

The number and kind of tests done everyday change as well as more capacity is created or less capacity is available due to overloads or work restrictions.

I told myself the amount of deaths, as horrible as it sounds, is a good indicator of stabilization or regression. But no, people are not effected the same way regarding their previous medical condition. At some point in time, people at risk will ""disappear"" (again sorry for the word-choice).

I have the feeling that there so many variables and factors we are not able to gather regarding this pandemic (at least currently) that statistics are at their limit. Announced trends are most likely wrong. 

How sure can we be about statistics in the current situation? Are trends viable? What can be compared what not? Is all current information foundationless?
","do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good  many of the issues you have raised are perfectly reasonable concerns. having said that, it is important to distinguish between cases where reported data is wrong, versus cases where reported data is correct, but is limited in its usage due to the omission of other relevant information. the latter case is really quite ubiquitous in statistical analysis, since it is very rare that we have all the data we would ideally like to have. in such circumstances, it is also important not to make the perfect the enemy of the good by presuming that the absence of a comprehensive dataset on every variable we would like to know about precludes any reasonable inferences being made from the data we have.  the main comprehensive public dataset we have available for the covid-19 virus is the data held and updated by the john hopkins coronavirus resource centre at john hopkins university. this is the repository of data that is being used for the vast majority of media reports and data visualisations on the spread of covid-19. the database has data on confirmed infections, recoveries, and deaths, plus gis data on where these occurred. the data is sourced from the who and various national health departments, and it is being updated frequently.  it is certainly true that there are a lot of other things we would ideally like to have data about, to assist in understanding the path and severity of the virus. as you have suggested, it would be wonderful if we could also obtaina comprehensive dataset on all the tests that have actually been conducted  including the negative results , and the characteristics of all the affected patients, including their age, sex, and health factors. at this early stage it is probably overly ambitious to expect all of this data to have been collected and collated, but hopefully the various health departments of the world will eventually be able to bring some of this data together. health departments cannot legally disclose health information on particular patients in a way that would make them identifiable, so it is an extremely complex task to collate this type of data if the goal is to make it available for public analysis. no doubt there will be some efforts to obtain and collate more detailed data, but it will be a difficult task.  when interpreting limited data, it is desirable to describe that data in a way that makes it clear how it was collected, and this collection mechanism forms a caveat on analysis. thus, we can refer to the reported numbers of infections, recoveries, deaths, etc., from each of the reporting countries, while noting that there may be disparities from these figures to the actual true numbers. most health departments around the world are set up so that they can obtain these figures with reasonable accuracy, so that large diparities between reported figures and the true values are unlikely, except in the case of countries that make a deliberate effort to suppress this information. notwithstanding the lack of the ideal data you would like, from the reported data there are certainly some things that we can reasonably infer. for most countries, the data is likely to be a reasonably representation of the number of infected, recovered, and dead patients out of those who have been properly tested.  of course, i take some of the data, such as the recent numbers from china, with a large degree of scepticism.  it is also likely that there are other infected and recovered people who have not been tested, and who therefore do not form part of the reported statistics. even so, this data gives us a pretty good look at growth rates for the infection in various cities and countries around the world, which allows us to see where the virus has progresssed most rapidly, and where it has been relatively contained. these numbers also allow some attempt at extrapolation, which allows health authorities to make predictions on the likely number of cases at future dates, and the health burden this will create in different places.  your question appears to assert that most of these trends are likely to be  wrong  due to the absence of data on other factors such as total testing and patient health. in my view, that is not the correct way to look at it. rather, the reported trends may be correct, in the limited descriptive sense, but there may still be underlying non-reported factors that would give reason to anticipate future changes in those trends. personally, i am extremely impressed at how rapidly these various organisations have coordinated a large data collation and made public online platforms reporting on the infection and updating it frequently. i can log on every day and see updated graphical information showing the progression of the infection in virtually any city or country in the world  the data may not be perfect, but i would think it would bear enough of a resemblance to reality to be valuable information. i think the effort is quite amazing, and it far past what we could do even ten years ago.

"I am asking this question because I believe it would be great if the statistics community could make a contribution to solving this serious puzzle until more evidence is available. 

The UK Royal Office of Obstetricians and Gynecologists publishes guidelines on neonatal and prenatal treatment of Corona positive women and babies of Corona positive women. There is insufficient evidence to give an advice whether breastfeeding is safe in the sense of not passing virus from mother to child via the mother milk. There are other infection ways but mother milk could be expressed and fed while keeping distance, e.g. by father.

A source is quoted in the guidelines (p. 27) that 6 Chinese women's breast milk was tested Corona negative; that is, six of out six samples were negative. If we consider these tests independent events, where the event is to sample a woman who passes the virus via the mothermilk, we have a binomial trial.

Which confidence or credibility statements can we make about the probability to pass on the virus to the mother milk? This probability is estimated at zero in this trial, of course. 

Some statements can be made; for example if the probability was 0.50 the likelihood of the data would be 0.015. If it approaches 0, the likelihood approaches 1, but it is not differentiable at zero, so standard likelihood inference fails.

Please note: The same guidelines advise in section 4.8.2 to continue breastfeeding by COVID-19 positive women: ' In the light of the current evidence, we advise that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. The risks and benefits of breastfeeding, including the risk of holding the baby in close
proximity to the mother, should be discussed with her.' (p. 27)
","there is the rule of three saying     if a certain event did not occur in a sample with  n  subjects, the interval from  0  to  3/n  is a 95  confidence interval for the rate of occurrences in the population.   you have  n 6 , so says   0, 3/6 0.5   is a 95  confidence interval for the binomial  p  of transmission. in non-technical language: 6 non-events is way too few for any strong conclusions. this data is interesting, suggesting something, but no more.  this rule of three is discussed at cv multiple times is rule of three inappropriate in some cases , when to use  and not use  the rule of three, using rule of three to obtain confidence interval for a binomial population and certainly more ... a more principled approach is here: confidence interval around binomial estimate of 0 or 1 and using code from an answer to that question:  binom::binom.confint 0, 6, method c  wilson ,  bayes ,  agresti-coull  , type  central     method x n mean lower upper 1 agresti-coull 0 6 0.00000000 -0.05244649 0.4427808 2 bayes 0 6 0.07142857 0.00000000 0.2641729 3 wilson 0 6 0.00000000 0.00000000 0.3903343  ",131
"Due to the coronavirus KLM canceled all flights from China about a week ago. Naturally we are entitled to a full refund. According to European Union air passenger rights, passengers are also entitled to up to €600 Of compensation in the case of a canceled flight. However, we requested a cancellation of our tickets five days before they announced the cancellation of our flight but after it became public that China closed down Wuhan with the risk of other cities. So we wanted to leave as early as we could. KLM had given notice that they offer rebookings and cancellations at that time. 

Are we therefore also entitled to a 600€ refund Or would we have had to first give KLM the chance to offer us an earlier flight before booking a flight with another airline and canceling theirs? Or should we have waited 5 days until they cancelled the flight to be entitled to receive both the refund + compensation?

So in short, what does the compensation depend on? Also, does the corona virus qualify for the airline to waive the compensation penalty because it’s an “extraordinary circumstance” in the legal sense?

Edit: the cancellation &amp; approval of the refund claim of my ticket came into effect yesterday, 5 days after the flight would have taken place. We received no confirmation of cancellation neither for our specific request nor any warning of the airline itself that the flight was cancelled in general. This suggests that they A cancelled our tickets and therefore B didn’t consider us a passenger anymore at the time of cancellation. Still, it’s odd that they never gave us confirmation of the ticket cancellation. Just a “pending approval for refund request” state. 
","the airline did not cancel your flight. they cancelled a flight that you were not booked on at the time of the cancellation. it is as simple as this. you were not booked on the flight, so you are due no compensation.  if you had not already canceled your tickets, and you were still booked on the flight at the time of the cancellation, then you might have been due compensation under eu261, but it is very likely that the airline would consider an epidemic to be  extraordinary circumstances  which removes the need for the airline to provide compensation.  addition to address the update to the question : simplistically speaking, airline bookings have two parts - a  reservation  which covers the booking on specific flight segments on specific days, and a  ticket  which basically shows that you have paid for those flights. when you book a flight, first a reservation is created, then you pay, and then a ticket is issued.  when you cancel flights, the reservation of those flights is cancelled. at that point, you are no longer booked on those flights, although you still potentially hold a ticket. this will happen immediately that you ask for the flights to be cancelled, as the airline wants to be able to free up the seats so they can sell them to someone else. no refund will be made as a part of cancelling a reservation.  at this point, you hold a ticket that states you have paid  x for, but which contains no flight segments as they have been cancelled. depending on the airline, the actual ticket you purchased, and any special conditions the airline might allow  such as allowing refunds during an event like an epidemic even if the ticket does not normally allow refunds , the value on that ticket might be lost entirely, might be only able to be used to book a future flight, or might allow a refund.  in order to actually get the refund, whoever issued the ticket  which might be the airline you were flying, another airline, or a travel agency  will need to cancel it and process the refund back to you. this is a separate step in the process, and it could happen hours, days, or even months after the reservation was cancelled.  however none of that changes the fact that once the reservation has been updated, you were no longer booked on that flight, and thus no longer due compensation.

Why are medical workers getting sick with or dying from coronavirus if they’re wearing protective gear?,"many health care workers do not actually have enough protective gear to handle the growing influx of coronavirus patients.   some have resorted to using plastic report covers as masks. the cdc said medical providers might have to use expired masks or reuse them between multiple patients.  this shortage is why the general public should not buy medical masks and instead make cloth masks at home.   but it is not just subpar protective gear that puts medical workers at risk. it is also the amount of virus they are exposed to.    the viral load -- the amount of virus - does determine the severity of your illness,  emergency room physician dr. leana wen said.  so that could happen in the case of health care workers who are exposed to a lot more covid-19 as a result of their work -- that they get more severely ill.

","the additional check in time is needed for all the extra paperwork. repatriation flights are organized and approved by governments to help return citizens to their country of origin. they can not let anyone on board who is simply willing to pay the fare. they must check and double check your passport, citizenship status, etc. moreover, scheduling a repatriation flight is not the same as regular commercial flight operation. the planes often arrive empty, without a regular gate to occupy, without a regular slot to fly and the whole operation can be changed at the last-minute. if you really want to get on the flight then it is best to be there extra early to deal with the unexpected.

I've heard that taking drugs like ibuprofen to ease COVID-19 symptoms could actually worsen the progress of the illness. Is that true?,"the world health organization and many infectious disease experts say that there is no good scientific evidence establishing a link between ibuprofen and worsening of covid-19. the notion that such a link exists was sparked last weekend when a tweet by the french health minister warned people not to take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs -- a category of pain relievers and fever reducers that includes ibuprofen -- because, he said, some french covid-19 patients had experienced serious side effects. the warning was also included in a bulletin from the french health ministry, which counseled that patients should instead use acetaminophen, the generic name for tylenol. but experts say that warning is not based on data.  based on currently available information, who does not recommend against the use of ibuprofen,  the who stated on its official twitter account, adding,   we are also consulting with physicians treating covid-19 patients and are not aware of reports of any negative effects of ibuprofen, beyond the usual known side effects that limit its use in certain populations.  dr. angela rogers, a pulmonologist at the stanford university medical center and chair of its intensive care unit is covid-19 task force, notes that tylenol is the go-to medication for patients who are sick enough to be hospitalized for any infection. that is because these patients are at higher risk of damage to internal organs, including kidneys. and kidney damage can be a side effect of ibuprofen for some patients who use it long-term in higher doses, says rogers, whose research focuses on the kind of acute respiratory distress experienced by the most severe covid-19 cases. tylenol, like any medicine, is not risk-free either  rogers notes that acetaminophen can cause serious liver damage in high doses. in low doses, though, she says, tylenol is  very effective  for reducing fever and  very safe.

Are there such (comparative) statistics available for US states? E.g. did these numbers fall in NY (which was hardest hit by the pandemic) more than elsewhere in the US?
","yes, google has published these statistics at a per-state level for the united states.   to use the example in your question of new york, compared with a state with far fewer covid-19 cases currently, such as west virginia, we can see that new york has seen large reductions in mobility trends across every category except residential, while west virginia has relatively smaller reductions, and in fact a large increase in mobility trends for parks.   this seems to be similar across the board, with the statistics for nebraska, with a similar number of cases as west virginia also showing smaller reductions in most categories, a smaller increase in residential mobility trends, and a whopping 109  increase in mobility trends to parks. new jersey, however, another state which has been fairly badly hit, sees a large reduction in the statistics across the board.  at a first glance, then, this would seem to support your theory that these numbers fell more significantly within states that have been hardest hit by the pandemic so far, meaning that social distancing measures are being complied with and taken more seriously in these states. further analysis would need to be performed on the full data set, including the range of social distancing regulations and enforcement levels in the individual states in order to draw full conclusions.  google themselves state in their reports that  location accuracy and the understanding of categorized places varies from region to region, so we do not recommend using this data to compare changes between countries, or between regions with different characteristics  e.g. rural versus urban areas .

"Are we aware of a ""bug"" (virus, bacterium, prion, ...) that has completely exterminated an entire species? Either through direct observation or maybe some form of archeological evidence? If not, are there realistic scenarios where this could happen?

I am primarily interested in cases where the disease was the driving factor of extinction of an otherwise well established and healthy population, but examples of species that were in bad shape to begin with are welcome as well.

My understanding is that this is unlikely, since very deadly infections tend to burn out or evolve towards being less deadly. Killing your host is not conducive to your survival. But maybe it would be possible to reduce the number of individuals so much that reproduction became problematic. I imagine a species confined to an island or something might be susceptible.

I'm asking this because in an interview I saw, an epidemiologist said that his usual research interest are ""bugs with species ending potential"". The interview was on COVID-19 so he didn't elaborate on what he meant by that or give any examples.

For the special case of humans, I was able to find this article that claims such an event to be unlikely, but I suppose we are the best equipped species that has ever existed on this planet to deal with such a threat.
","from the vantage point of other species, humans might be considered  bugs  in the sense that we are organisms that are causal in the ongoing extinction of numerous species. we are doing a pretty good job of it, so far:    the included extinctions span numerous families of plants 4  and animals, including mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and arthropods. with widespread degradation of highly biodiverse habitats such as coral reefs and rainforests, as well as other areas, the vast majority of these extinctions are thought to be undocumented, as the species are undiscovered at the time of their extinction, or no one has yet discovered their extinction. the current rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than natural background rates.

  Trump's pro-economy death-permissive stance during the COVID-19 crisis


What are the facts backing this claim?
","i can not speak for rebecca is judgement in interpreting those words of trump, but for instance a nyt article says:     our people want to return to work,  mr. trump declared tuesday on twitter, adding,  the cure cannot be worse  by far  than the problem      in essence, he was raising an issue that economists have long grappled with: how can a society assess the trade-off between economic well-being and health   ...      we put a lot of weight on saving lives,  said casey mulligan, a university of chicago economist who spent a year as chief economist on mr. trump is council of economic advisers.  but it is not the only consideration. that is why we do not shut down the economy every flu season. they are ignoring the costs of what they are doing. they also have very little clue how many lives they are saving.   ...      making people poorer has health consequences as well,  said kip viscusi, an economist at vanderbilt university who has spent his career using economic techniques to assess the costs and benefits of government regulations.    jobless people sometimes commit suicide. the poor are likelier to die if they get sick. mr. viscusi estimates that across the population, every loss of income of  100 million in the economy causes one additional death.    government agencies calculate these trade-offs regularly. the environmental protection agency, for instance, has established a cost of about  9.5 million per life saved as a benchmark for determining whether to clean up a toxic waste site.    other agencies use similar values to assess whether to invest in reducing accidents at an intersection or to tighten safety standards in a workplace. the department of agriculture has a calculator to estimate the economic costs -- medical care, premature deaths, productivity loss from nonfatal cases -- of food-borne disease.   so, the argument  in there  is that governments always make such trade-offs/choices, whether they are incredibly open about them or less so.    i should also mention  here, in case comments get purged again  that the nyt article discusses in a bit more depth the finer points of balancing the economic losses from lockdowns with those that would occur in an unchecked epidemic. this topic has been a addressed in some recent economics publications, e.g. eichenbaum et al. discussed in the nyt article  but see also a simpler  lockdowns 101 economics . for the broader economic aspects of the crisis see also  the economics of coronavirus  on econ se.

How do you practise safe sex during a pandemic?,"if you live with your partner, they count as being part of your household. if neither of you is showing coronavirus symptoms and you are already in close contact, having sex will not increase the likelihood of you catching the virus from one another. if one person does have symptoms, they should be self-isolating in a separate room. using contraception such as condoms will not alter your risk of catching the virus, as having sex will bring you into close physical contact anyway.  if you are going to touch each other is genitals it is likely that you will potentially be kissing at the same time - and we know the virus is passed through saliva,  dr alex george told the bbc is newsbeat.  essentially, any possibility of transfer of coronavirus - from your mouth to your hands, to genitals, to someone else is nose or mouth - increases the risk of passing on coronavirus.

"From (answers to) a related question, the WHO had mostly changed their public stance on the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 after Jan 22, while giving mostly ""negative signals"" on this matter of human-to-human transmission before Jan 22.

Interestingly, on Jan 17, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) put out a rapid report saying that: 


  The occurrence of a few cases having no history of contact with the implicated market
  or other any similar market suggests the possibility of the infection source being more widely distributed, or of human-to-human transmission similar to other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The occurrence of a few family clusters also supports this latter hypothesis. However, there is currently no knowledge on the transmission mode or risk factors for transmission. Furthermore, there is no information on the disease spectrum or risk factors for severity. In light of these unknowns, we cannot exclude the possibility of low-level virus circulation in the Wuhan community and thus the possibility of other clusters occurring in the near future. [...]
  
  
  There is a high likelihood of case importation in countries with the greatest volume of people travelling to and from Wuhan (i.e. countries in Asia).
  There is a low likelihood of importation of cases in EU/EEA countries, due to the less extensive traffic of people with Wuhan. 
  


For comparison, what did the US CDC say on this matter (human-to-human transmission) within this period (i.e between Jan 14 and 21), and did they also asses back then (like the ECDC did) the likelihood of importation into the US?



Insofar I was able to find, by Jan 31, the US CDC was clearly convinced of human-to-human transmission:


  On January 31, 2020, CDC published updated PUI guidance (8) in response to the evolving global epidemiology of 2019-nCoV, including the rapid geographic expansion and documentation of person-to-person transmission (9). Updated guidance emphasizes 2019-nCoV testing for symptomatic persons in close contact with patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, persons returning from Hubei province in addition to Wuhan City, and persons from mainland China requiring hospitalization because of fever and lower respiratory tract illness. Additional refinements to this approach likely will be needed in the future as understanding of 2019-nCoV epidemiology continues to improve.


But what did they say roughly two weeks earlier, before the WHO had confirmed human-to-human transmission?
","on january 17th, the cdc announced that covid-19 screening would begin at  three u.s. airports that receive most of the travelers from wuhan, china: san francisco  sfo , new york  jfk , and los angeles  lax  airports.   they also state in this press release that:    cdc is actively monitoring this situation for pertinent information  about the source of outbreak, and risk for further spread through  person-to-person or animal-to-person transmission. cdc may adjust  screening procedures and other response activities as this outbreak  investigation continues and more is learned about the newly emerging  virus. entry screening alone is not a guarantee against the possible  importation of this new virus but is an important public health tool  during periods of uncertainty and part of a multilayered government  response strategy. as new information emerges, cdc will reassess entry  screening measures and could scale activities up or down accordingly.   this indicates that an assessment of the likelihood of importation of the virus into the us was completed, and a decision was made that only the airports with the largest amount of traffic needed to be screened. they do however note that this is not a guarantee that the virus will not be imported. further on in the briefing, they mention that:    china health officials report that most of the patients infected with  2019-ncov have had exposure to a large market where live animals were  present, suggesting this is a novel virus that has jumped the species  barrier to infect people. chinese authorities additionally report that  several hundred health care workers caring for outbreak patients are  being monitored and no spread of this virus from patients to health  care workers has been seen. they report no sustained spread of this  virus in the community, however there are indications that some  limited person-to-person spread may have occurred. cdc is responding  to this outbreak out of an abundance of caution, ready to detect  people infected with 2019-cov.   this briefing suggests that while the cdc was preparing for human-to-human transmission to be confirmed, and may have even thought that this was likely, it did not have the data to confirm this.  later on, on the 21st, the cdc released another briefing after the first covid-19 positive patient was identified in the us. the briefing notes that the patient returned from china on the 15th, before the screening mentioned above was implemented. this release, however also does not state that human-to-human transmission is confirmed, but mentions that    while originally thought to be spreading from animal-to-person, there  are growing indications that limited person-to-person spread is  happening. it is unclear how easily this virus is spreading between  people.   at this point the cdc also implemented screening at two more airports, atlanta and chicago.  it seems clear, therefore, that the cdc did not have access to data which confirmed human-to-human transmission, although the steps taken to implement health screening at airports, and the advice given to healthcare providers on january 8th indicates that it certainly thought that the likelihood of this was great. clearly the health screening also proves that spread from wuhan was seen as a possibility, although we can infer from the fact that this was initially only set up at three airports that this was either not seen as a large possibility, or that the spread via air-travel was not expected to be high enough to warrant a complete lock-down.

Is there a recommended technique for propagating it myself so I don't run out, and have enough to share?
","absolutely there is a way to propagate yeast, it is as simple as making a starter with it. most of the time these days people create starters for sourdough using natural yeasts, but you can use them to feed any kind of yeast. all you would do is put flour and water in a container with some yeast, let it get to work and once you start to get bubbles put it in the fridge to slow it down. you would then use half of it for every batch of bread you make, replacing the flour and water to keep it at the same quantity.   if you do not use any of it for a few days you would want to throw half away and refill in order to give the yeast a fresh supply of food. you can share this with as many people as you like, just split it into two, give each a fresh supply of flour and water, and repeat as many times as necessary. using this technique a small amount of yeast could theoretically supply the entire planet.   note: during the coronavirus outbreak it is worth noting that corona can survive on surfaces for quite some time, so you should take great care to ensure that your yeast propagation does not lead to virus propagation  ",125

"I have been reading about the spread of virus and understand comparisons that are being made with the flu.  The flu propagates through a population with vaccinated people while a new virus has an unvaccinated population.  I would like to understand the limitations of using data from the flu and making inferences to dealing with Covid19 given their populations are fundamentally different.

When you look at how contagious a virus is they talk about transmission rates without indicating if the rate is the base rate or the effective rate.  The flu and Covid19 have similar base rates, however 40% of the US population is vaccinated from the flu.  Does that mean that the flu actually has a much higher transmission rate in un-vaccinated people and the average works out to a number similar to Covid19 in an unvaccinated population?  Or does in mean that vaccine doesn't stop the spread as much as it really stops the disease?
","reproduction numbers  first of all, the basic reproduction number   r 0   refers to the contageous person meeting susceptible people only: the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. so  r 0  is not affected by vaccination status  or acquired immunity  of the population, but it includes factors such as being contageous already during incubation period  i.e. while still free of symptoms, how contageous a single virus particle is, how long a virus particle lasts under  normal  circumstances, ...   in contrast, the effective reproduction number r includes the effects of vaccination, acquired immunity, behaviour and other measures to reduce infection risk.  the wiki page linked above lists  r 0  for covid-19 as 1.4-3.9 and for the spanish flu of 1918 as 2-3.  now, for the countries that still have just a few covid-19 cases and that are just beginning to take measures to slow the spread, the effective reproduction number will be roughly the same as the basic reproduction number: noone is immune yet, and no measures to reduce the number of contacts yet.     does that mean that the flu actually has a much higher transmission rate in un-vaccinated people and the average works out to a number similar to covid19 in an unvaccinated population    sort-of, but rather the other way round: it means that the effective reproduction number is lower for the flu even though their  r 0 s are similar.   this review paper gives an r of about 1.8 for the 1918 flu and about 1.3 for the  normal  seasonal flu.    vaccination    or does in mean that vaccine does not stop the spread as much as it really stops the disease    that can also happen. of course, the best and intended outcome of vaccination is that the acquired immunity is sufficient to prevent infection. which means that the vaccinated person cannot spread the disease. however, not all vaccinatione we have and use achieve this - we still use them if they greatly reduce the severity of the disease. e.g. even with varicella vaccination 10 - 30   of the exposed to get chickenpox  but even with them, serious disease is avoided .   for the flu, the difficulty is that new strains appear regularly. this is also the reason why flu vaccination is done annually with a newly developed vaccine while e.g. for mmrv, pertussis, polio boosting with the existing vaccine every 10 years is sufficient  immunity actually may last even longer, up to lifelong , but that varies by person, and since many vaccines have not been around that long, we do not know for which that is the case . in fact, flu strains appear so often that the development of the annual flu vaccine includes educated guesses which strains are going to be important for next season. sometimes that guess is off. wikipedia on flu vaccination has a table giving effectiveness  actual reduction of infection risk  between 10 - 60   for different years. even if the acquired immunity by vaccination is for the wrong strain, one may still benefit from cross-immunity    in that the disease will be milder and possibly shorter.      also acquired immunity after a disesase does not always last life-long, e.g. a pertussis infection will achieve immunity for 4 - 20 years only  4 - 12 years for vaccination  ",50
"Following the recent Coronavirus outbreak, various mortality rates have been published.

Most of these are simply the ratio between the deaths and the total verified cases, which is not a very accurate indicator as many of the verified cases are ongoing and could result in deaths.

I know some statistics from university but I am in no way an expert. I was wondering if there was any commonly used statistical model to predict with some accuracy the mortality rate of an ongoing epidemic. If there is, I'm guessing some of the variables would be the time between the onsetting of symptoms and death/healing for resolved cases.
","a natural  and perhaps naive  way to model mortality would be a binomial model, i.e.,     x  sim  text binomial  n, p      here  x  is the number of deaths,  n  is the total number of people infected, and  p  is the mortality rate, or the probability of dying given that you have the disease.  when we say something is distributed according to a binomial distribution, we mean that the observed counts  x  are the result of  n  independent trials, each with probability of  success   in this case, death   p . these are usually termed  bernoulli trials .  we can now examine the likelihood of  p  given  x  and  n  -- i.e., how likely it would be to see the data we have observed, given different values of  p . imagine we had 100 cases, 50 of which resulted in deaths:  n  lt - 100 x  lt - 50 s  lt - seq 0, 1, length.out 1000  plot   s, dbinom x, size   n, prob   s , type  l ,  xlab    mortality rate  p  , ylab    binomial likelihood        this shows that a point estimate  the maximum likelihood estimate  would be 0.5, which of course makes sense. something important to consider here is the amount of data we have observed. since we have a good amount of observations, the likelihood is fairly narrow. this means that there is a relatively small range of values for  p  for which the data we observed would be likely to occur.  now, imagine if we had only 10 cases, 5 of which resulted in deaths:  x  lt - 5 n  lt - 10 s  lt - seq 0, 1, length.out 1000  plot   s, dbinom x, size   n, prob   s , type  l ,  xlab    mortality rate  p  , ylab    binomial likelihood        when we do not have much information, the likelihood is quite broad, indicating that the data would be fairly likely for a wide range of values for  p .  it can be helpful in cases like this to incorporate a prior, or how likely we think different parameter values are, based on our existing knowledge. for example, imagine that we knew that the distribution of mortality rates across all known human diseases looked something like this:  s  lt - seq 0, 1, length.out 1000  plot   s, dbeta s, 32, 64 , type  l ,  xlab    mortality rate  p  , ylab    proportion of diseases        this is a beta prior with   alpha 32  and   beta 64 , i.e.,   p  sim  text beta  32, 64  . we might want to use this prior information to guide our inferences about the mortality rate of a new disease for which we have very little information. we can combine this prior information with the likelihoods we have already plotted. if you want details about how this is done, one great starting point is this blog by david robinson. basically, the posterior distribution over our parameters is a beta distribution. for parameters we take the   alpha  of our prior and add  x , and take the   beta  of our prior and add  n-x .  s  lt - seq 0, 1, length.out 1000  n  lt - 100 x  lt - 50 plot   s, dbeta s, shape1   32   x, shape2   64   n - x ,   type  l , xlab    mortality rate  p  , ylab    posterior density        as you can see, this prior information  pulls  our estimates downwards towards the distribution of existing mortality rates. however, if we had strong enough evidence  for example, thousands of infections and deaths  we could still produce an estimate outside of where the prior distribution is concentrated. when we have a small amount of data, a prior can be particularly helpful to avoid results that are purely the result of sampling noise - for example, imagine the first 10 people with a disease happen to die, and the next 90 survive. the estimate after 10 people would be 100 , which is extremely unlikely, given what we have seen about human disease in the past.  s  lt - seq 0, 1, length.out 1000  n  lt - 10 x  lt - 5 plot   s, dbeta s, shape1   32   x, shape2   64   n - x ,  type  l , xlab    mortality rate  p  , ylab    posterior density        when we have very little data, this prior information really shrinks our estimates towards what we believe is a reasonable estimate of mortality, given what we have observed in the past about other diseases.  you can continually update this posterior distribution as new data comes in by adding deaths to the   alpha  parameter and survivals to the   beta  parameter of the beta distribution.  this is all just general  i have no real expertise in disease modelling. none of the parameters values i have chosen have any basis in reality.

How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses different?,"the speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. influenza has a shorter median incubation period  the time from infection to appearance of symptoms  and a shorter serial interval  the time between successive cases  than covid-19 virus. the serial interval for covid-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. this means that influenza can spread faster than covid-19. further, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre-symptomatic transmission -transmission of the virus before the appearance of symptoms - is a major driver of transmission for influenza. in contrast, while we are learning that there are people who can shed covid-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver of transmission. the reproductive number - the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual - is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for covid-19 virus, higher than for influenza. however, estimates for both covid-19 and influenza viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct comparisons more difficult. children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community. for covid-19 virus, initial data indicates that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0-19 age group are low. further preliminary data from household transmission studies in china suggest that children are infected from adults, rather than vice versa.while the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different. for covid-19, data to date suggest that 80  of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15  are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5  are critical infections, requiring ventilation. these fractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection. those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed. for covid-19, our current understanding is that older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection.mortality for covid-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. while the true mortality of covid-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio  the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases  is between 3-4 , the infection mortality rate  the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections  will be lower. for seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1 . however, mortality is to a large extent determined by access to and quality of health care.",122

"On Apr 9 2020, the Fed for the First Time Can Buy Junk Bonds. That Should Help ‘Fallen Angels.’


  The Federal Reserve is making its first-ever foray into the junk-rated corporate bond market, saying it will consider buying noninvestment-grade corporate bonds and exchange-traded funds.
  
  As part of an effort to make available \$2.3 trillion in new loans amid the coronavirus crisis, the central bank said Thursday that it would buy the bonds of “fallen angel” companies, or companies that get downgraded from investment grade to junk. Companies will qualify if they had an investment-grade rating on March 22 and have since been downgraded to one of the top three tiers of the high-yield bond market (BB+, BB or BB-).


Bloomberg has a title ""Moral Hazard"".  Can't companies ""leverage themselves into oblivion and when they all [fail] the Fed will just buy their worthless bonds""?


  But the nature of the Fed’s actions pass the traditional boundaries of the central bank to purchase lower-rated debt and the credit of municipalities, raising questions about its future role.
  
  ”That does present some moral hazard but a lot will depend on how these programs are executed and how they’re unwound,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. “Are they executed in a way that doesn’t unduly benefit people? If the programs are devised effectively, hopefully that won’t be the case.”


Are these Reddit comments below correct? I edited r/economics.


  Let’s call it what it is, junk bonds. They don’t care about municipalities, this is buying up corporate garbage debt to bail out the rich. Corporate bonds was bad enough, junk bonds are straight garbage that WAS SUPPOSED TO BE RISKY so why is the Fed buying it. This is no benefit to Main St. at all. If your argument was the municipalities need to issue debt to function and this helps grease that market, the right answer is that municipalities that cannot clearly afford projects should not issue debt. Let’s be honest, boomers had so much money they threw it at high yield, enjoyed the gains but now it’s garbage so the taxpayer is bailing them out.
  
  This is the end of capitalism and free markets. You could argue that a few banks were too big to fail, maybe they should have. Now you are talking about 100’s of companies like Best Buy and Macy’s that we’re already doing bad so we are throwing cash at them in the form of loans and also bailing out their debt to people who shouldn't have bought it. Don’t forget how much these CEOs and boards make.
  
  I hate to be political but let’s remember T[ARP] actually made money, it was risky but the QE was limited in amount and by assets that were “good”. Look at the group of individuals in charge now and their financial history, the idea that the Fed will get its money back is an absolute joke.
  
  Junk bonds are junk because they are risky.
  By definition they don't deserve to be saved by the government.
  
  Its purpose is to place cash on the balance sheets of organizations that invest in securities like junk bonds in the hopes that they will wake up and see credit risk and roll the cash into the stock market to bolster the President's re-election chances.
  
  [Source] Buying junk bonds is stupid - these shitty companies are all getting free money from the fed while at the same time laying off and furloughing millions of workers. Banks and other people with money then buy up ownership in these companies that won’t fail (arguably many should), benefiting from rising stock prices while the companies pay out no wages to workers. It’s all fake and will prop up the wealthy people who own businesses and leave the rest of America in line for food stamps. There is no reason for this insane rally in stock prices when upwards of 10 million Americans are unemployed.

"In light of the coronavirus outbreak centred in Wuhan, many countries have taken steps to either prevent entry or require a quarantine period for arrivals from the affected area.

"This question comes about from another virology question concerning the common cold (Would being infected with every kind of cold virus strain at once be a good immunization or dangerous?).

The original edit stated that there are over 200 different viruses which cause the common cold, and after reading the linked Wikipedia article, it said just under the intro panel (the bit with a representation of a virus) what I believed to confirm my initial thought, that it is virus strains not different viruses.


  Well over 200 virus strains are implicated in causing the common cold, with rhinoviruses being the most common.


So I commented the fact and after editing to suit, the author responded with (emphasis mine)


  @Chris Rogers How do you explain this from wiki?The common cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. The most commonly implicated virus is a rhinovirus (30–80%), a type of picornavirus with 99 known serotypes.[29][30] Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronavirus (≈ 15%),[31][32] influenza viruses (10–15%),[33] adenoviruses (5%),[33] human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and metapneumovirus.[34] Frequently more than one virus is present.[35] In total over 200 viral types are associated with colds.[3]


I have not been able to find anything online the difference between the two (if there are any). Are the rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, metapneumoviruses etc. involved different strains of the same virus or are they different viruses all together?
","it is often said that a common cold can be caused by more than 200 different  specific viruses   rhinovirus, influenza virus... , which suggests 200 virus species, but there are other levels of categorization of viruses  families, genera,  types,  etc. , so this can be a bit of apples and oranges situation, but in any case, 200 specific viruses does not mean 200 strains.    more than 200 different viruses are known to cause the symptoms of  the common cold.  national institute of health     the common cold is an upper respiratory infection that is caused by  several families of viruses. within these virus families, more  than 200 specific viruses that can cause the common cold have been  identified. the virus family that causes the most colds is called  rhinovirus. rhinoviruses cause up to 40  of colds, and this virus  family has at least 100 distinct virus types in its group. other  important upper respiratory virus families are named coronavirus,  adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. since so many viruses can  cause cold symptoms, development of a vaccine for the common cold has  not been possible.  harvard medical school    each species of a virus can further appear as different strains.    in biology, a strain is a low-level taxonomic rank used at the  intraspecific level  within a species .  wikipedia    for example, all different strains of influenza virus will be still called influenza virus and the detailed name will be used only for laboratory/research purposes, not for the  public.      every year different strains of influenza virus appear, so every year a new vaccine targeted to those strains needs to be developed to be effective.

Apparently on the same show another fairly high profile US politician said


  SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): For a small segment of our population, it's true, the coronavirus can kill you. For a small segment.
  
  But you know what else can kill you? Poverty. Hunger. Losing the entire economy.
  
  And we need to stop thinking about the next election and try to think a little more about the next generation and what we leave to them, which is going to be the little end of nothing if we let this economy collapse.


According to CNN (which alas doesn't link to the actual polls they mention):


  The often-dismissive messaging from Fox News hosts was notable, given that the viewers who make up the network's audience skew older and are thus more vulnerable to the disease.
  
  Polls from both Gallup and Pew Research revealed that Republicans — who are largely distrustful of mainstream news organizations and primarily turn to Fox News and other right-wing sources for information on current events — were much less likely to take the risks of the coronavirus as seriously as their Democratic counterparts.


Of course, this being a rather emotionally charged judgement, it probably matters a lot how one phrases such a question/choice. Still, I want to know if there any surveys in the US on how much the public sees the mortality risk posed by COVID-19 (which as we know is most elevated for the elderly) as acceptable in balance with preserving the ""American way of life"", ""keeping America great"", or some other equivalently formulated socioeconomic normality [for the US]?



Before I get anymore downvotes, please note that I'm not endorsing those views... but they do exist in various shapes, e.g.


  As fears of COVID-19 spread, so too have ageist messages suggesting that the coronavirus is a disease of the old, with internet memes referring to the virus as a ‘boomer remover.’ 


On the less frivolous side, the NYT has an article [sub]titled: ""Shutdown Spotlights Economic Cost of Saving Lives. President Trump and others have asked if halting normal life and commerce to fight the coronavirus is worth the cost. Here’s how economists figure it. [...]


  “Economists should be doing this cost-benefit analysis,” said Walter Scheidel, an economic historian at Stanford University. “Why is nobody putting some numbers on the economic costs of a monthlong or a yearlong shutdown against the lives saved? The whole discipline is well equipped for it. But there is some reluctance for people to stick their neck out.”


(For more on economics aspects of the crisis, see this econ SE question.)

So I think I'm well justified in asking this question, i.e. how widespread such views might be, especially when it comes to making a [hard] choice.
","in the most recent polls i found  and there are a helluva lot of polls on coronavirus in the us  from march 26:    about seven-in-ten adults  71   say that to address the coronavirus, it is necessary to require most businesses other than grocery stores or pharmacies to close. a larger share of democrats and democratic-leaning independents  81   than republicans and gop leaners  61   view this requirement as necessary.   so most are  now  approving of not-business-as-usual measures to combat the epidemic. actually, a bit later, this pew poll details the public response to a few more specific measures, although this is aftery had been anounced/implemented:    as some  polling  pundits predicted a week ago after commenting on those old-by-now polls  of march 20 or so :    pew shows that 59  of democrats and democratic-leaning independents say the  outbreak is a major threat to the health of the u.s. population as a whole,  while only 33  of republicans and republican leaners agree.    it is certainly possible that this significant partisan gap in views of the coronavirus situation will narrow in the weeks ahead. partisans take cues from the statements of their leaders, and trump and other republican politicians initially were publicly skeptical of the significance of the virus, in some instances claiming that it reflected a partisan effort by democrats and  the media  to criticize trump. now, trump and his allies have begun to move away from that previous posture and are at the forefront of proclaiming the seriousness of the crisis. as media observers have noted, this in turn has brought about shifts in the tone of the coverage by fox news, and these shifts may narrow the partisanship gap in the days and weeks to come if rank-and-file republicans follow the cues given by their favored thought leaders.

This is in stark contrast to the publicly disseminated value of ~2% mortality, so have I made a mistake in my calculation or assumptions, or is COVID-19 much more dangerous than commonly claimed?  

[After a helpful discussion in the comments, 'mortality rate' is not the correct term to use here, instead I should say 'Case Fatality Rate'.]
","the definition of mortality rate that you have given does not match any practical definition i am familiar with.   when people talk about the mortality rate of a disease, what they usually mean is the case fatality rate or the death-to-case ratio, which is simply defined as nd / ni, where nd is the number of deaths attributed to the disease over a given time period and ni is the total number of new cases of the disease observed during the same time period. by this definition, the current case fatality rate of 2019-ncov according to your quoted figures is 362 / 17491     2.07 .   the tracker seems to have been updated since you asked your question, and now lists a total of 20679 confirmed cases and 427 deaths, for a cfr of 427 / 20679     2.06 .      as a theoretical definition of the mortality rate in the long run, when all infected patients have either died or recovered, it can sort of make sense. but then it becomes equivalent to the usual definition of the case fatality rate.    to compare this with your definition of  mortality rate   as nd /  nd   nr , where nr is the number of individuals who have recovered from the disease , we need to start by observing that there is no single universal and unambiguous definition of what  recovering from a disease  means. commonly used definitions tend to be something like  no symptoms for x days  and/or  viral load below n particles per ml for x days  or simply  whenever a doctor declares that you are healthy again and lets you out of the hospital .  now, let is say that we are using a  somewhat  objective definition of recovery like  no detectable symptoms for two days . the first observation is that any epidemic first observed less than two days ago would, according to your definition, inevitably have a mortality rate of 100  simply because none of the people infected so far would have had time to be considered definitely recovered yet.  that is assuming that at least one person had died from the infection  otherwise both the numerator and the denominator would be zero, and the rate thus undefined.   further, even after some of the earliest cases have been symptom-free long enough to be counted as recovered, your definition would still yield a highly upwards biased estimate of the  true  long-term fatality rate during the early phase of the epidemic, when the number of new cases per day is still increasing. this is because, for most infectious diseases, any deaths typically occur when the disease is at its most severe state, whereas those who survive the disease will then experience a gradual decline in symptoms as their immune system succeeds in halting and reversing the progress of the infection.    for an illustrative example, let is consider a hypothetical disease with a theoretical 1  long-term average cfr -- that is to say, exactly 1  of all  recognizably  infected patients will die of the disease. let is further assume that this disease typically takes two days to progress from the initial onset of recognizable symptoms to the state of maximum severity, which is when most of the deaths occur. after this, assuming that the patient survives, the symptoms gradually decline over the following three days. as remission is possible  but rare , doctors will generally consider a patient recovered only after showing no symptoms for at least two days. thus, a typical case would progress as follows:    onset of symptoms - increasing symptoms  2 days  - peak severity - declining symptoms  3 days  - no symptoms - observation  2 days  - officially recovered  total time: approx. 7 days from onset    or, for the 1  of patients for whom the disease is fatal:    onset of symptoms - increasing symptoms  2 days  - death  total time: approx. 2 days from onset    now, let is assume that, during the early period of an epidemic when the infection is still spreading exponentially, the number of new cases increases by a factor of 10 every three days. thus, during this period, the number of new cases, recoveries and deaths per day might grow approximately as follows  assuming for the sake of the example that exactly 1 , rounded down, of the patients diagnosed on each day will die two days later :     cases   recovered   deaths        day   new   total   new   total   new   total   nd / ni   nd/ nd nr    ---- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- --------- ------------   1   1   1   0   0   0   0   0.00    n/a    2   2   3   0   0   0   0   0.00    n/a    3   5   8   0   0   0   0   0.00    n/a    4   10   18   0   0   0   0   0.00    n/a    5   20   38   0   0   0

table above, naively calculating the case fatality rate as  total number of deaths  /  total number of cases  during this exponential growth period does underestimate the true long-term cfr by a factor of  in this case  about 5 due to the two-day lag time between infection and death. on the other hand, using your formula of  total deaths  /  total deaths   recovered  would overestimate the true cfr by a factor of about 30   meanwhile, let is assume that, after the first 12 days, the growth of the epidemic saturates at 10,000 new cases per day. now the total numbers will look like this:     cases   recovered   deaths        day   new   total   new   total   new   total   nd / ni   nd/ nd nr    ---- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- --------- ------------   13   10000   18888   50   88   20   38   0.20    30.2     14   10000   28888   99   187   50   88   0.30    32.0     15   10000   38888   198   385   100   188   0.48    32.8     16   10000   48888   495   880   100   288   0.59    24.7     17   10000   58888   990   1870   100   388   0.66    17.2     18   10000   68888   1980   3850   100   488   0.71    11.2     19   10000   78888   4950   8800   100   588   0.74    6.3     20   10000   88888   9900   18700   100   688   0.77    3.5     21   10000   98888   9900   28600   100   788   0.80    2.7      as you can see, the two measures of mortality rate do eventually start converging as the growth of the epidemic slows down. in fact, in the long run, as the majority of patients either recover or die, they do both end up converging to the  true  long-term case fatality rate of 1 . but by then, the epidemic will be basically over.  there are various ways to obtain a more accurate estimate of the long-term fatality rate even during the early exponential growth phase of an epidemic. one such method would be to look at the outcomes of a single cohort of patients diagnosed at the same time. for our hypothetical example epidemic, looking e.g. at just the 1000 patients diagnosed on day 10, we could get an accurate estimate of the cfr by day 12 simply by dividing the 10 deaths within that cohort by the total number of patients in the cohort. furthermore, observing multiple cohorts would give us a pretty good idea of how long after diagnosis we would need to wait before the estimated case fatality rate for each cohort gets close to its final true value.  unfortunately carrying out this kind of cohort analysis for 2019-ncov would require more detailed information than the tracker you have linked to provides. even the time series spreadsheet the tracker links to does not directly provide such detailed cohort data, although it might be possible to obtain better estimates from it by making some more or less reasonable assumptions about the typical progress of the disease.    addendum: a few preliminary cohort studies of the kind i describe above do appear to have already been published for 2019-ncov.  in particular,  a novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern  by wang et al. and  clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in wuhan, china  by huang et al., both published on january 24 in the lancet, note that, out of the first 41 patients diagnosed with 2019-ncov before jan 2, 2020 in wuhan, six had died  and 28 had been discharged, leaving seven hospitalized  by jan 22, giving a case fatality rate of 14.6  in this cohort.  however, they do advise treating this figure with due caution, noting a number of reasons  besides just the small number of cases examined  why it may not fully reflect the eventual long-term cfr:     however, both of these  cfr  estimates  of 14.6  from the 41 patient cohort and of 2.9  from all 835 cases confirmed at the time of writing  should be treated with great caution because not all patients have concluded their illness  ie, recovered or died  and the true number of infections and full disease spectrum are unknown. importantly, in emerging viral infection outbreaks the case-fatality ratio is often overestimated in the early stages because case detection is highly biased towards the more severe cases. as further data on the spectrum of mild or asymptomatic infection becomes available, one case of which was documented by chan and colleagues, the case-fatality ratio is likely to decrease.    there is also a later paper titled  epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in wuhan, china: a descriptive study  by chen et al., published on jan 30, that examines a cohort of 99 patients diagnosed between jan 1 to jan 20 and reports a cfr of 11  within this cohort. however, the study only followed these patients up to jan 25, by which time more than half of them  57 out of 99  still remained hospitalized.

"In CNN's video Scientist says Coronavirus vaccine could be ready by 2021 after about 00:25 'Robin Shattock, the Head of Mucosal Infection and Immunity at Imperial College London' says:


  We were able to access the sequence that was published by Chinese scientists and made globally available, which was a tremendous thing to do. And we went from that sequence to identifying part of the sequence that encodes for the surface proteins of the virus. And we’re using that sequence to manufacture our vaccine.
  
  We’re using a particular approach where we make a synthetic vaccine based on RNA, so essentially it’s essentially genetic code, we package that in essentially a lipid droplet, and use that to inject in a muscle; it expresses that protein, and the body recognizes that as foreign and it makes protective antibodies.


I'm assuming that this is mRNA and so once it reaches the cytoplasm of the vaccine recipients muscle cells it will be expressed and somehow returned to the cells' membrane where it will be recognized as foreign by passing lymphocytes.

Questions:


Is this basically correct as far as it goes? 
If so, what causes the lipid droplet to fuse with muscle (or other) cells in the first place?

","i can not give an authoritative answer on this because my phd work was based on mrna delivery using peptides instead of lipids, but many of the concepts are the same. i also do not have time to provide proper citations, but this is probably too much for a comment.  anyway, mrna is a very fragile molecule, it can be broken down extremely quickly in the blood by serum nucleases. therefore we must protect the mrna by mixing it with some other chemical, in this case a mixture of positively charged lipids. the positively charged lipids are attracted to the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the mrna, and form a nanoparticle trapping the mrna inside and hiding it from the nucleases. the lipids are often, but not always, pegylated, which means that a molecule of polyethylene glycol  peg  is attached to the lipid. the peg groups form a layer on the outer surface of the nanoparticle that helps prevent protein binding.  these mrna lipid nanoparticles are then injected into a patient. this will probably be an intramuscular injection so that the particles are most likely to be taken up by muscle cells. the exact mechanism explaining why lipid nanoparticles are attracted to cells is not entirely clear, but it is likely a combination of electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nanoparticle and the negatively charged cell membrane and proteins that bind to the nanoparticle and are then recognized by receptors on the cell surface.  after the particle is taken up by a cell it is usually trapped inside a membrane-bound structure called an endosome. as the endosome matures it is acidified, and as the ph drops from about 7 to about 5.5 the nanoparticle is disrupted. the lipids that made up the nanoparticle can merge with the lipids that make up the endosomal membrane, disrupting that membrane and breaking open the endosome, allowing the mrna to escape into the cytoplasm.  once in the cytoplasm the mrna will find a ribosome and produce protein. just like you said, the protein in this case will be membrane bound and expressed on the outer surface of the cells for eventual immune recognition.

What factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing whether the risks are acceptable or not?,"for countries not currently known to be experiencing community transmission of covid-19, the priority consideration will be whether the planned mass gathering event substantially increases the risk of the virus entering the country and becoming established, as well as the risk for participants to importing infection back to their home country and further increasing global spread. in making this assessment, the organizers and their national or local health authorities should recognize that the risk of imported cases of covid-19 is naturally linked to international travel. they should also recognize that it is neither realistic or desirable to aim for zero risk. when organizers and health authorities are determining whether to hold a mass gathering, they should determine what is an acceptable risk and what additional measures should be implemented to mitigate the risks.for countries where covid-19 has already started to spread in the community, key consideration will be: aiming at containing or at least slowing down the spread of the virus in the local community/country.preventing participants from other countries being infected with covid-19 in each case the risk should be considered in the context of the known features of covid-19, its severity, its transmissibility and the effectiveness of measures to prevent or reduce transmission. the strain already placed on the local health system in responding to covid-19 outbreak s , and the additional strain the mass gathering might place on the system also need to be taken into account.you can find more advice on what to look at in the who document key planning recommendations for mass gatherings in the context of the current covid-19 outbreak of 14 february 2020. see: http://www.who.int/publications-detail/key-planning-recommendations-for-mass-gatherings-in-the-context-of-the-current-covid-19-outbreak",75

","i can only speak of drug design  and even then i am terrible at turning down the jargon .  in the case of drug design, this is pretty much plan c. namely, none of compounds that entered clinical trial at the start of the year work  let is call this plan a  and none of the vaccines that are entering now clinical trial work  let is call this plan b although vaccination prevents so is a better solution . clinical trials take a lot time as they need to be thorough  cf. the infamous thalidomide from the days with more lax testing   there are several bottlenecks in drug design. these are technical based on our imperfect understanding of things, which results in less than ideal models. cpu time is not really an issue. empirical validation is required at many steps along the way. this is greatly increased by automation. the xchem team at diamond light source have done a fragment-screening against the sars-cov-2 main protease at an insane pace: things are changing fast   drug screen  there are many ways to make a drug. in one way, a test system was set up  a reporter assay  that gives you a measurable read-out, say mm of clearance of bacteria on a petri dish  viability  around a cellulose dish soaked in different separated natural extracts --and you might find that penicillium chrysogenum has a compound of interest. what you are doing is drug screen. screening a large panel of compounds  of varying purity  does not necessarily require knowing the protein target.  rational drug design  fast forward to this decade and it becomes possible to predict the free energy release upon binding of a small molecule against a protein --mostly.  this requires a solved 3d structure of the protein by x-ray crystallography. crystallising a protein is a tricky business, as a pure protein sample has to come out of solution in a folded form to form a neat lattice as opposed to just making unfolded gunk. what salt conditions work  anyone is guess. some have done deep learning on it, but the best solution is to have a robot try a very large range of combinations.  once you have a protein structure you can predict what fits into the part that you want to target, say an active site or an interface. this is not done by simple cartesian geometric shape fitting like lego bricks as there are many molecular forces involved. so a mathematical model of these forces is made, called a force field. many have been made, a lot of study has gone into these, but they are not perfect. it is all made worse by the fact that we cannot really model water properly --most models use a proxy  implicit solvent  or use non-polarisable water. this is all while made worse by the fact that a protein is not static but wobbles  following the same mathematical models . so a ligand does not slot in really like a key in a lock, but has an induced fit. modelling all this is accurately is problematic, but one can still try: calculating where exactly a ligand binds to a protein is called for which one gets energy difference upon binding. and one can try an inordinate amount of small molecules --zinc db contains 230 million purchasable compounds. this is called a virtual screen. one can even start with the natural substrate and  weaponise it  by adding chemical groups that do a chemical reaction that breaks the protein. however, a metabolite is very different from a drug  cf. lipinski is rule of five  as the latter must cross membranes etc. but generally the accuracy is not great without multiple steps of empirical validation.  to improve the results from a virtual screen the most common approach is to do a fragment screen to guide it. this is to automatedly soak protein crystals with a large library of small compounds and see which crystal contains a bound hit. the hits can be expanded into bigger fragments in a virtual screens and the short list of compounds tested  these are not cheap  by soaking and crystallising again. in the case of covid19 virus, the cool thing is that this whole process is open in the aforementioned current campaign  diamond is a government owned synchrotron and not a big pharma . what is really nice about this is that for the second cycle comp-chemists from everywhere have done their own guided virtual screen and have submit compounds  which you can see publicly .  it should be said that drug screens that are not rational design are still a thing. the recent antibiotic-discovering deep-learning paper in cell 6 is such an example, although it should be said that it was a feat not only in ai but also in automated empirical testing.  future  automation via better and open software will definitely improve. with a small drive possibly from the dissemination of easy to use and to code off-the-shelf electronics, such as rasperry pis or arduinos. but mainly with more complex machines such as the opentron system  a python-controlled robot .  but indubitably where the greatest improvement can come is better mathematical models. possibly even with deep learning. after all researches were amused last year-ish  2018 competition  when deepmind  won  the protein 3d structure  fold  modelling competition  casp13  and there have definitely been some really nice results in the field of docking with hybrid models. so deep-learning may still surprise us yet...  lastly, open science will be a strong driver: using premade packages or tools on github and code snippets from stackoverflow etc. will accelerate these.

"I want to do a multi day cycle tour in Germany, but campsites are closed.

According to the interior ministry (Coronavirus: Fragen und Antworten) 


  Der Aufenthalt im öffentlichen Raum ist nur alleine ... gestattet."" (I can go into public places on my own).


2 questions


Can I do a multi-day cycle tour? Mainly in the Saarland and Rheinland-Pfalz. Perhaps also Hessen. 
Can I camp in public spaces?


The questions are in the context of the Corona virus. In previous years in summer I have seen people camp out in the open along various rivers (Mosel, Rhine, Saale, Fulda). Myself I have camped in the open in the Blackforest, Erzgebirge and various other parts of Germany. But there was no Corona virus. I do not want to know if stealth / wild camping is allowed in normal times. 

I am also worried that with a touring bicycle (bags on rear and front racks), the authorities will immediately see that I am doing a tourist activity and not simply going to work.

(I am already legally in Germany.)
","tl dr: you can, possibly, in some places, but it may not be a great idea.  whether it is legal depends on the bundesland  state  -- to put it simply, the federal government has no authority in these matters, and each state put down their own rules. there are federal rules for entry into germany, but these do not apply as you are already in the country.  example rules  for example: in saarland they implemented a lockdown  possibly due to their proximity to the heavy-hit regions of france : you may only leave your home due to  important reasons . on the other hand rheinland-pfalz has a  contact prohibition , which means that you can free to go wherever you want, as long as you are with no more than one other person.   also, individual cities have the right to be more restrictive.  things change  case numbers will rise in germany and regulations may become more strict at any moment. in which case it may be difficult for you to go back home  also: do not count on any restrictions being lifted until well after easter -- at best   infrastructure is shut down  however, even in rheinland-pfalz accommodations are not open for touristic purposes. this will include campgrounds.  wild  camping is only regulated by the lander, but generally there will be restrictions, and camping spots may be cordoned off.   also, most public services that are useful for travellers are also shut down.  enforcement  it is difficult to say how things will be enforced. generally there is no formal requirements in germany, unlike in italy or france. they will still stop and fine you if you blatantly flout the rules. my guess is that nobody will go and check for wild camping in the middle of nowhere, but they may check popular camping spots to make sure people do not congregate there.  responsibility  cycling alone is not really an  additional  risk, as long as you do not meet people. however, the question is if it is going to be a fun trip if you   can not go in places like the saarland, keep to yourself all the time, have to find a remote spot to pitch your tent each night, and have no access to sanitary facilities, have to bring/buy and cook your own food  there will be no restaurants .   plus, germany is a densely populated country -- it will be hard to really be alone. and as soon as more than one person pitches their tent in one place, the police will likely see that as a  congregation  and break it up.   in all honesty, it is probably a better idea to stay put in one place. if the local laws allow it, you can still go cycling and return to your home each night.

","the accepted knowledge is that boiling water for 1 minute kills viruses. however, that is not necessary for sars-cov-2. any food you eat is going to be cooked for longer than a minute, and packaging can left for a couple of days for the virus to inactivate naturally.    the standard recommendation for boiling water is a full rolling boil for one minute and cool before use. the term rolling boil facilitates communication and assures that an effective pasteurization temperature is reached to kill or inactivate waterborne pathogens. some agencies recommend boiling for longer periods, but this extra time is not necessary and can cause unnecessary power demand and increase safety concerns.   for cardboard boxes:    on cardboard, no viable sars-cov-2 was measured after 24 hours   and on plastics/stainless steel    sars-cov-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard, and viable virus was detected up to 72 hours after application to these surfaces  figure 1a , although the virus titer was greatly reduced  from 103.7 to 100.6 tcid50 per milliliter of medium after 72 hours on plastic and from 103.7 to 100.6 tcid50 per milliliter after 48 hours on stainless steel .   so, it can last for 72 hours at least though at greatly diminished amounts of viable virus. so, use soap/water to wipe these surfaces down. soap disrupts the virus capsule, and also forms a surfactant around the virus so it can be dislodged from surfaces. some people do recommend you wash your vegetables of unknown provenance in soap and water.   http://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/water/drinking/boilwater/response information public health professional.htm  http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/nejmc2004973 ",107

"I am an organizer for a graduate student conference in Mathematics occurring in April. My co-organizers and I are debating on a plan for what to do if the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States worsens. Right now, most of the participants are from states with no confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but this may change rapidly as the situation develops between now and the conference.

This is an issue other conferences throughout history have surely had to deal with, so I wanted to ask StackExchange if there were any best practices around for dealing with an issue like this. Some questions:


How far out should the go/no go decision be made? If the conference is late April, should we be planning to let participants and speakers know by early April so they can cancel flights and so on?
What criteria should best inform whether we cancel or not? Number of cases in the participants' states for instance?
In the event we are to cancel the conference, how can we still give the speakers a chance to advertise their results? Have there been successful ""video conferences"" before where the organizers collect video for each talk and then upload them and participants can make comments? 

","regarding remote conferences, these have been successful. often the motivating factor has been mitigating climate impact. for example, yale climate connections wrote an article giving advice for running virtual conferences. author sara peach presents three kinds of virtual conferencing, all of which have been done successfully:    remote presentations in a traditional conference format. if people choose to not travel, they can still remote in or follow the session on social media.  example: agu  hub-based conference, where people gather in regional clusters. each hub has some of its own content but are able to watch each other is presentations.  example: international conference on music perception and cognition  an entirely remote conference, where people record and upload videos of presentations and conferencegoers have weeks to ask questions and interact.  example: a nearly carbon-neutral conference model    i will add that an entirely virtual synchronous conference has also been done successfully. one example is nacada, the global community for academic advising, which ran a 24-hour live-streaming virtual conference.   the mixed-conference or hub models may or may not be feasible, since they would still involve people gathering in some models, and you are not sure yet whether that will be feasible on any scale. also, developing regional hubs would take time you do not have. thus, if you decide to go entirely virtual, a synchronous-with-live-streaming conference and a asynchronous recorded approach have been done, and the resources linked should provide a way to start researching or planning that model. i also advise contacting your own it department about the possibility.

"I have heard about the saying “It’s the economy stupid”, but I’m not sure about how true it is now. 

Let’s use Trump’s approval as an example. Even though there is a “rally around the flag effect” that is typical of leaders during crises (it is a lot smaller than governors and foreign leaders and especially President Bush in 2001), it does show that despite the stock market crashing, his approval continued to rise before presumably hitting a ceiling of about 46% on 538. For more context, in the years before, at 538, his approval was hovering at around 43% despite a relatively strong economy. 

I have read that the economy is not affecting people’s voting habits nearly as much as it used to. Is that true?
","firstly, to address the example of the covid-19 pandemic, and its effect on the popularity of donald trump  the level of correlation between the performance of the economy and us presidential popularity is well studied. for example, lse research in 2013 found that presidential approval is highly sensitive to changes in the share index:    a positive change in the index, when controlling for other relevant  factors, on average produces an increase in the president is approval.   interestingly, the effect is even more pronounced when we look at  market acceleration or deceleration. when the market is growing at an  increasing rate, voters reward the president, but when growth is  decelerating, the president is punished.   you are right that president trump is current opinion polls would seem to buck this trend, as the stock market has plummeted, with the dow jones crashing around 8000 points since the end of february, while the president enjoys record high approval ratings of 49  according to gallup. however, i would argue that instead of an indication that these two measures are no longer intrinsically linked, they are rather an exception to the rule, precedent for which already exists.  we can, for example, consider the performance of the stock market in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, with the nyse and the nasdaq closing for almost a week, the dow jones falling 14 , and the nyse market falling by 7.1 , a record at the time. clearly in normal times, this would have led to a dramatic fall in presidential approval. however, as you note in your question, president bush is approval rating soared to around 90 , the highest ever for a us president, and would go on to gradually lower over his tenure as president.  another example might be the gulf war in 1991. although this took place in the middle of a recession, which had lowered the approval of president bush snr., his victory in the crisis gave him record approval ratings. this lead was, however, squandered over the next year, as gallup puts it:  americans  attention shifted from the persian gulf to the struggling u.s. economy . he would, of course, go on to lose the 1992 election to bill clinton.  it seems, therefore, that rather than this incongruency representing a break from the established conventional wisdom that presidential approval, and as a result, us political outcomes, mirrors the stock market, it is at least at the moment a reflection of previous examples of the  rally around the flag  effect that you note in your question. whether or not trump is approval rating continues to stay at this high level will depend on how his response to the crisis is judged by the american public.  secondly, to evaluate the scope of your question more generally, there is a growing body of research which seems to support your notion that the aforementioned link between the performance of the economy and the electoral outcomes of incumbent politicians is becoming weaker, at least in the us.   for example, the nyt conducted a survey  notably before the current pandemic  weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the united states, in which public opinion regarding trump is handling of the economy was tested. the full results can be found here. their analysis suggests that:    economic conditions have historically been among the best predictors  of presidential elections, and models based on those patterns suggest  that mr. trump would be favored to win re-election if the economy  remains more or less on its current path through election day. but it  is unclear whether historical lessons hold in an era of heightened  partisanship.   in particular, surveymonkey, who conducted the poll, note that    when asked which political party in general does a better job handling  the economy, the public is locked in a 45-45 deadlock. republicans  overwhelmingly  95   favor the republican party, while democrats  overwhelmingly  88   favor the democratic party. independents are  split, with 39  favoring the democrats and 36  favoring the  republicans.   it would seem according to this research, that although  jobs and the economy  remains the most important issue for the largest proportion  24   of the survey participants, their other partisan beliefs are unlikely to shake their party loyalty in the wake of a change in economic fortunes.  in addition, 538 has a great article on this, which i will not go into too much detail on because this answer is already pretty long, but in particular, silver notes that:    in particular, we do not have enough data to make overly specific  claims about the economy. that is, any time you see what you might  call a  magic bullet  claim, such as that second-quarter gdp is  crucial or that per-capita disposable income is the key economic  variable, you should be wary.   although he also echoes the misgivings of the nyt article, that partisanship could dull the response to a recession, he maintains that the performance of the economy is still very important to the outcome for the incumbent party -  the better off america is by november, the more likely he is to be re-elected.   in conclusion, then, although there is evidence to suggest that the conventional link between the economy and the fate of incumbent officials is weakening due to increased polarization and partisanship, the link is still undeniably extant. while in this specific case around the covid-19 pandemic the incongruency can perhaps be explained by the  rally  round the flag  effect, it seems likely that the ultimate fate of trump is 2020 campaign will be defined by his response to the pandemic and the underlying economical issues over the coming months. it is still far too early, in my opinion, to write off our conventional knowledge based on a few opinion polls conducted during a crisis.

"This article shows us that some US institutions rely on very old systems (written decades ago, which is very long in IT time perspective):


  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy says that the state is looking for
  volunteers with skills that can be used to help in the COVID-19
  coronavirus outbreak, and one of those skills is knowing your way
  around a 61-year-old programming language used on big, old, mainframe
  computers. 
  
  COBOL is an old computer programming language that was first developed
  in the 1950′s in conjunction with the Department of Defense. Today,
  most programmers prefer and use more modern languages, but there are
  pockets where old software written in COBOL remains in use,
  particularly financial applications and in large enterprises or
  government agencies.


I understand that state institutions are typically much slower that private companies when it comes to IT investments, but having such old systems seems strange. Relying on systems written so much time ago incurs lots of issues which translates to wasted time and money:


initial developments done way before modern software development frameworks were around us
it is much harder to find specialists which know the language, but also are able to adapt to such an old software development style
inability to act in a timely fashion when changes or maintenance must be performed (e.g. Coronavirus outbreak)


It makes for banks to be reluctant to rewriting their systems due to big costs and risks, since they must also make profit. But a public institution is not profit based and in theory can easier invest in modernizing their software systems.

Question: Why did some US institutions not migrate their very old software systems to use somewhat newer ones?

Note: I am not thinking about big leaps, but at least to work with languages and frameworks that are at most 20 years old, not 60 years old. 



While the main arguments are related to software development risks, I am interested in the political aspect of the ""why"", since we are talking about public institutions making the decision to partially / totally rewrite some systems. Such aspects might be related to the size of projects or quality of management in the public sector.
","it is not just us institutions, there are many countries, institutions - including banks - and companies running on ancient software and hardware.  there are multiple reasons for that:  first, from the business standpoint, replacing software costs money. why spend money to replace something that already meets requirements  if you have software a that does what you want, already exists and is  free , since you already own it, and software b, which does not exist yet, costs years of development time, probably requires new hardware and has the associated costs for all of that, which would your boss or your  often very much non-technical  boss  is boss approve  what would a government employee with a tight budget approve  what would a politician calling for less government spending approve   secondly, the exact workings of the system are often lost in time. no one actually knows what the system does exactly, but it interfaces with dozens of other systems through apis that are equally unknown, obscure or deprecated. creating a specification for such a system that a contractor/contracted company can work with is difficult, if not impossible. there is a huge risk that the resulting system will not replicate the behavior of the old system and stuff will stop working. it might do things like round .5 up instead of rounding to even like the old system, which could cause all the bills or transactions to suddenly be off by 1 cent compared to the previous system. in government, a broken system could mean that the unemployed might not get their benefits, the tax payers not their yearly tax payback or any number of things that will lead to an elected politician not being reelected. politicians like being reelected, so even if they understand the technical need, which is rare anyways, they might avoid the risks for political reasons. often there were attempts at replacing the system, which then failed and then those failures get pointed at whenever someone proposes replacing the system.  thirdly, the old systems usually have a very bad user interface. a new system will have a shiny, new interface, sometimes because creating the old interface would not even be feasible in a new application. this requires training people. people that have worked in the company or institution for 40-50 years and are very set in their ways. those people often have a lot of blocking power, which can completely halt development on the new system, because their requirements, i.e.  do not change anything,  are not met. they are usually also very hard to fire and replace, so the institution has to hire new people without firing them, which requires a bigger budget, which comes back to the first point.  in summary, as technical people we might understand that those systems will someday inevitably go  poof  and everything will break down catastrophically. other people either do not know that it can happen, or they just hope that it will happen after their time, because in the end no one wants to pay the money, take the risk and take the blame for a project that will probably fail.

"How long will it remain potent outside an organism?

I tried looking at the coronavirus Wikipedia page and have not found anything there.

I did find somewhere that a flu virus would typically not remain potent for more than 14 days outside of an organism, but I'm not sure if this applies to all viruses.  
","since it seems unlikely that these data are available already from the novel virus, i will refer to other coronavirus strains associated with outbreaks, the sars-cov coronavirus associated with an outbreak in 2003 and mers-cov.  in reference to the stability of the virus outside the body for sars-cov, the who consensus document said:    data from the chinese university in hong kong indicated that sars-cov has  been isolated from stool on paper, a formica surface and a plastered wall after 36 hours, on a plastic surface and stainless steel after 72 hours, and after 96 hours on a glass slide.  hospital environmental samples from a number of sites, including walls and the ventilation  system, tested pcr positive in canada.   a later follow-up confirmed that sars-cov is viable possibly for days in the right conditions:    in the present study, we have demonstrated that sars cov can survive at least two weeks after drying at temperature and humidity conditions found in an air-conditioned environment. the virus is stable for 3 weeks at room temperature in a liquid environment1   1chan, k. h., peiris, j. s., lam, s. y., poon, l. l. m., yuen, k. y.,  amp  seto, w. h.  2011 . the effects of temperature and relative humidity on the viability of the sars coronavirus. advances in virology, 2011.  this suggests that sars-cov was better at surviving in the environment than other related strains, especially in cool temperatures. however, there was still a substantial decrease in viral titre by 1 week.  for mers-cov,    mers-cov virus could still be recovered after 48 hours2   ...on plastic and steel surfaces, though not at 72 hours, at 20c. the virus degraded more quickly at higher temperatures.  2van doremalen, n., bushmaker, t.,  amp  munster, v. j.  2013 . stability of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus  mers-cov  under different environmental conditions. eurosurveillance, 18 38 , 20590.    assuming the new 2019-ncov virus is similar to these, there is a risk of environmental transmission particularly in high-exposure locations like hospitals. it seems far less likely to be a risk after multiple weeks, but there is still little known about the new strain.  i was unable to find more than speculation about rates of actual infection due to exposure in these conditions, but that speculation is mostly focused on the health care setting and in particular on transmission in health care settings despite extensive precautions.  it is very difficult to connect culture viability to actual transmission risks, and not really ethical to swipe different concentrations of a coronavirus on the surfaces of a room and let people wander through to see how many get sick. therefore, the best evidence for surface transmission of these viruses is when other methods of exposure can be mostly ruled out, and this is a very imperfect estimate.

Can infected people who recover get it again?,"can infected people who recover get it again  it is not known. a few reports from china say some people had covid-19, recovered and then fell ill again. it is unclear if that is a relapse, a new infection, or a case where the person never fully recovered in the first place. scientists at the at the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle say the 30,000-letter genetic code of the virus changes by one letter every 15 days. it is not known how many of these changes would be needed for the virus to seem different enough to the immune system of someone who had a previous version of it for it to cause a fresh infection. fauci told congress on thursday that it was unlikely that someone could get reinfected.  we have not formally proved it, but it is strongly likely that that is the case,  he said.  because if this acts like any other virus, once you recover, you will not get reinfected.

We're about to exchange on a house but have been advised by the solicitor not to. When will restrictions on house purchases be lifted?,"there are currently no formal restrictions on moving house, although the government has strongly advised against it where possible. it says that while there is no need to pull out of transactions, buyers and renters should delay moving so they can observe social distancing and self-isolating guidelines.    if the house you are moving into is empty, it is fine to carry on as long as these rules are observed during the removals process. if the property is occupied, the government is encouraging the buyer and seller to find an alternative moving date further down the line.    mortgage lenders have also been tightening their restrictions, with some requiring a deposit of at least 25 . but this does not affect mortgages which have already been agreed. many lenders are offering customers who have already exchanged the option to extend their mortgage offer for up to three months so that they can move at a later date.    this timeframe may give you some idea of how long all of this could go on for, although nobody knows for sure.    the house buying process differs between scotland and england and wales, but the advice on delaying a move is the same.",52

Why is COVID-19 spreading faster and wider than SARS? What other factors have let COVID-19 reach pandemic levels, while SARS was contained and eradicated? Could the R0 factor be higher than believed? Was it initially slower to be contained?

Full disclosure, I'm not in medicine or a medical scientist. I'm a software developer and data scientist, and this has peaked my interested in the spread of infectious disease.
","the viruses are acting differently. sars2-ncov-19 virus is much more infectious with a much higher viral replication rate, and with people exhaling the virus in the pre-symptomatic phase whereas sars this was not happening. once the infected individual becomes symptomatic their bodies are producing antibodies which helps shut down viral particle shedding though virus is still being transmitted by cough which aerolizes the virus at a further distance then just by exhalation.    the nine patients, who were admitted to the same munich hospital, were studied because they had had close contact with an index case. cell cultures and real-time polymerase chain reaction  rt-pcr  were done on throat swabs and samples of sputum, stool, blood, and urine. throat swabs showed very high viral shedding during the first week of symptoms.    the findings contrasted starkly with those from the 2003 outbreak of sars in terms of viral load.  in sars, it took 7 to 10 days after onset until peak rna concentrations  of up to 5x105 copies per swab  were reached,  the researchers wrote.  in the present study, peak concentrations were reached before day 5, and were more than 1,000 times higher.    but the mean incubation period is 5 days.  http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses ",31

"Common advice given is that if you decide to become an active or passive investor, you should stick with the choice you've made. That you're less likely to be successful if you try to pursue both active and passive investing strategies.

But why is it a bad idea to combine both strategies?  For example, passively invest in index funds, but when an opportunity arises where it seems that you'll make a lot of money by actively trading, go with that strategy instead? For example with recent events, people are betting heavily against the S&amp;P500, as we're still in the beginning stages of the coronavirus pandemic as of this writing.
"," common advice given is that if you decide to become an active or passive investor, you should stick with the choice you have made.   no you should not. it is perfectly fine to supplement an active portfolio by passive index funds, or to supplement an index fund portfolio with several carefully chosen stocks.  what is bad advice is to buy lots of various active funds  leading to index returns, because there are so many of the active funds, without low costs of index investing . if you believe in active investing, you should select only a fund or at most two in the same market, having fund managers you can trust.  what is also bad advice is to buy quasi-active funds, funds that claim to be active but do not really take any active risk because the fund manager fears losing to the index return. in this case, too, you pay for active management but get passive returns.  let me propose a case where you could supplement an index portfolio with some actively chosen stocks. if you, for example, like traveling a lot more than most people. unfortunately, traveling uses oil, so it might be a good idea to buy stocks of oil companies. traveling also requires aeroplanes, so it might be a good idea to buy aeroplane manufacturer stocks. you of course travel with an airline, so it might be a good idea to buy airliner stocks.  or, if you drive a lot with an electric car. in this case, it might be a good idea to supplement your index portfolio with stocks of tesla and electric utility companies, especially those that produce electricity with fixed cost structure like hydropower or nuclear power.  let me also propose a case where you could supplement an active portfolio with some index funds: you run out of ideas. simply said. you have so much money to invest but you can not find any companies where you would like to increase your ownership. in this case, it is perfectly fine to buy index funds. or, you could hire a monkey to throw darts into a list of stocks to select new investments for you. but it is much simpler to buy index funds than to hire a dart-throwing monkey.

","age is a red herring, only a secondary characteristic correlating to death rates.  it is people that are already seriously ill or already have weak immune systems that are most likely to die soon after contracting covid-19. and it is when people are clustered in a close community that they are most likely to contract the disease.  in our society, the people in those circumstances tend to be old and in health-care facilities. as a result, most of our deaths so far have involved people over 80 years old.  in other societies, a lack of old people does not necessarily mean a lack people living in close quarters, that are weak or sick.  there is certainly no shortage of such conditions in many parts of africa.  from coronavirus disease  covid-19  - our world in data:   ",66
"A couple of colleagues suggested in a discussion that the virus that causes COVID-19 appears to be made by humans, since nature could not have produced such an efficient virus — that spreads so fast and whose patients are contagious quite some time before showing signs of infection.

Since my knowledge of biology is very limited, my only counterargument for such a conspiracy theory was along the following lines:


there is a consensus that the most probable source of the first infection was in an animal market in China.
since that animal market was actually composed of a plethora of animals belonging to various species (mixed with humans), a virus had a bigger chance of evolving a mutation that might infect an individual from another species (a thing that is way less unlikely in the wild since many of those animals do not sit close to each others or next to humans).


Clearly, I have made a little story that might be quite far away from how SARS-CoV-2 infected humans, so I am interested in a scientific arguments to support my cause.

Question: What are the main scientific arguments that can be used to debunk COVID-19 being engineered by humans?

Answers that also include explanations more accessible to laymen are greatly welcomed.
","at the moment, there is very little scientific literature about this, but i found two papers that address the problem and are fairly easy to understand. you can find them in the references. reference 1 is probably the most interesting and is the basis for this answer. edit: it is also interesting to read reference 2 on the origin of sars-cov-2, the article also addresses some of the conspiracy theories.  as far as i can see, there are a few major points taken up by conspiracy theories.  1. sars-cov-2 leaked from a lab, in which research on the bat cov  ratg13  was done:  unlikely, since both viruses share only around 96  sequence homology which translates into more than 1100 sites where the sequence of sars-cov-2 viruses is different from ratg13. the mutations are distributed throughout the viral genome in a natural evolutionary pattern, making it highly unlikely that sars-cov-2 is a direct descendant from ratg13. for comparison, the original sars-cov and the intermediate host palm civet sars-like cov from which it originated shared 99.8  sequence homology, showing a much closer relation.  2. the s  spike  protein from bat sars-cov cannot be used to enter human cells via the human ace2 receptor and therefore has been adapted in the lab:  this is untrue, since a 2013 study of a novel bat corona virus was published showing the ability of the virus to enter cells via the ace2 receptor. see reference 3 for details.  3. the spike protein of sars-cov contains a unique inserted sequence  1378 bp  located in the middle of its spike glycoprotein gene that had no match in other coronaviruses:  as shown in reference 4, the sequence comparision of the sars-cov-2 with closely related other corona viruses shows that this sequence is not unique to the new virus but is already present in older strains. it shows some difference due to inserted mutations.  4. the claim that sars-cov-2 contains four insertions from hiv-1:  the paper claiming this has now been retracted due to severe criticism, and additionally a renowned hiv expert published an analysis  reference 5  demonstrating that the hiv-1 claimed insertions are random rather than targeted.  5. the claim that the sars-cov-2 virus is completely man-made:  to design such a  weapon grade  virus in the lab, the design would usually start from a known virus backbone and then introduce logical changes  for example, complete genes from other viruses . this cannot be seen in the genome of the virus, rather you see randomly distributes changes throughout the genome coming from virus evolution and not directed cloning. it is more likely that this virus originates from the recombination of a bat cov  to which it is closely, but not directly related  and another, not yet known cov in an intermediate host, like the palm civet for the 2003 cov.  references:   no credible evidence supporting claims of the laboratory engineering of sars-cov-2 the proximal origin of sars-cov-2 isolation and characterization of a bat sars-like coronavirus that uses the ace2 receptor is sars-cov-2 originated from laboratory  a rebuttal to the claim of formation via laboratory recombination hiv-1 did not contribute to the 2019-ncov genome  ",118

Why it's said a coronavirus vaccine wont be ready for using in 12-18 months when for the H1N1 2009 outbreak there were vaccines available in 6 months?
","sorry this is a cut and paste answer from http://pharma.elsevier.com/pharma-rd/approaches-for-creating-a-covid-19-vaccine/    before the coronavirus disease 2019  covid-19  pandemic, no one had ever heard of the causative agent 2019 novel coronavirus  sars-cov-2 . there were no approved antivirals or vaccines for this virus or for any related coronaviruses  e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus  sars-cov  or middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus .    problems with covid-19 vaccine development    developing vaccines from scratch--which is required for covid-19--is typically not a good option for stopping an ongoing pandemic. the extensive time required to develop a safe and effective vaccine that can prevent future disease in vaccine recipients  average of approximately 10 years   1  means that the public health threat will end long before a candidate vaccine is licensed.    vaccine development requires extensive planning regarding vaccine design, vaccine production and purification, preclinical testing in animals  to ensure some safety in humans , and multiple phases of clinical trials in humans  phase 1 for safety and phases 2 and 3 for efficacy . companies taking the risk and proceeding with vaccine development for sars-cov-2  at least 13 companies as of march 7, 2020   2  are banking on the virus continuously circulating, so they have a population to conduct phase 2 and 3 trials with. if the virus disappears from circulation in china--or the perceived risk the virus poses to human health substantially declines--before phase 2 trials end, vaccine development will probably end.    vaccine design approaches    vaccines that are safe and stimulate the right immune responses that confer protection from disease are challenging to design. there are a number of different strategies companies have used: live attenuated or inactivated viruses, virus-like particles or other protein-based approaches, viral vector-based vaccines or nucleic acid-based vaccines. of the potential sars-cov-2 vaccines in the pipeline, four involve nonreplicating viruses or protein constructs, four have nucleic acid-based designs, two contain live attenuated viruses and one involves a viral vector  2 . regarding the previous sars pandemic, one inactivated sars-cov  3  and one dna-based vaccine  4  made it through phase 1 trials before vaccine development ended.    the different approaches for vaccine design all carry different advantages and disadvantages  5 . approaches involving replicating viruses stimulate robust immune responses, but safety is often a concern. protein vaccines and nucleic acid-based vaccines are often safer but typically have less immunogenicity, and they require adjustments to induce stronger immune responses. nucleic acid-based vaccines are typically the fastest to get into phase 1 studies, but no nucleic acid vaccine has been licensed for use in humans as of yet.    because of safety concerns involving older populations  who have higher risk for severe disease , using a live attenuated virus might not be the best approach  6 . patients with severe disease typically have t-helper 2 responses  immune responses typically induced against extracellular parasites , so vaccines known to elicit this type of immune response  inactivated viruses, virus vectors  might also be best avoided. vaccines involving protein-based  virus protein subunits, virus-like particles, nanoparticles  or nucleic acid-based  dna or rna encoding virus structural proteins  designs, which do not have known safety disadvantages, might be the best approaches for sars-cov-2.    unfortunately, our knowledge of the immune response is not advanced enough for us to accurately predict vaccine safety and efficacy. what we have to do  testing multiple different strategies  is exactly what is being done. only with results from more extensive research will we know the absolute best approaches for sars-cov-2 vaccine development.    furthermore experts have said that the sars-cov-2 virus is heavily glycosalated so that potential immune epitopes are hidden from the immune system.

How long does the virus live on an object like a dollar bill?,"depending on the type of surface, the virus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days, according to the who. a recent study by scientists in the u.s. found that viable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel.     however, a subsequent report from the cdc found that genetic material from the virus can live on surfaces for more than two weeks. the cdc found traces of the virus  rna, not the coronavirus itself, on surfaces in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers on the diamond princess cruise ship - 17 days after passengers had left the cabins.    it is possible that you can become infected if you touch your face after touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, according to the cdc. but scientists do not think surfaces are the main way that the virus spreads  the most common form of infection is from respiratory droplets spread by a person is cough or sneeze, the cdc reports.    meanwhile, the who says it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, traveled and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. that means the virus cannot spread through goods manufactured in china or any country reporting coronavirus cases.    at the same time, the who is reportedly encouraging people to use as many digital payment options as possible. viruses can survive on hard surfaces like coins for days in some cases. u.s dollars, a blend of fabric and paper, are harder for viruses to stick to.",110

","at the very least, coffee  caffeine actually  can can have a complex interaction with pain medication.   caffeine can actually enhance the pain-relief effects of some medications, like aspirin, which is why it is included in some  combo  otc painkillers in some countries.  but if you take these regularly and drink caffeinated drinks too, you may well exceed the daily rda for caffeine, 400mg/day according to the fda.   however:    oddly enough, what makes caffeine effective in pain relief can also cause headaches.    since caffeine narrows the blood vessels that surround your brain, when you stop taking it they expand again, and that can cause pain.   i have also heard that if you do not take any pain meds, coffee will usually enhance your feeling of pain, but i can not find any  reliable  sources to back this up, even though in some circles it is recommended you do not drink caffeinated drinks when you have some  painful  medical  or quasi-medical e.g. tattoo, piercing, laser hair removal  procedures scheduled. ymmv.  actually a 2018 paper found that habitual coffee drinkers have decreased sensitivity to pain.   there are probably more aspects to consider including rigors and diuresis/sweating, both of which are probably modulated by caffeine.   webmd says  in an md-reviewed article :    these drinks will not help you get over your cold or flu, and some could do more harm than good.  ...       coffee. if you are going to sip a hot drink, might as well get your daily dose of caffeine in it, right  wrong. try to stick with water and nutrient-rich soups.     but rather disappointing they do not offer any reasons why coffee should be avoided in this case, except that it is inferior to  nutrient-rich soups . but this seems hardly a flu-specific argument, i.e. you can not expect your diet to be just coffee anyway.  the cdc flu  patient  guide makes a similar recommendation:    if the sick person is not eating well, encourage  them to drink liquids. avoid alcohol or drinks  with caffeine in them such as colas, tea, and  coffee.   while apparently no reason whatsoever for avoiding coffee is given in there, this is put under the  tips to prevent dehydration  heading, so it is probably due to sweating/diuresis being enhanced by caffeine. this seems to be a really controversial topic, e.g. a time mag article cites some experts saying otherwise, so it is probably better left for a separate question.    it is true that caffeine is a mild diuretic, which means that it causes your kidneys to flush extra sodium and water from the body through urine. if you are peeing frequently, and thus losing lots of liquid, it is logical to think you could become dehydrated -- but it actually does not work that way, explains dr. daniel vigil, an associate clinical professor of family medicine at the david geffen school of medicine at the university of california los angeles.     when you drink a cup of coffee or you drink a glass of iced tea, you are necessarily taking in a volume of fluid along with that dose of  caffeine ,  vigil says. even though caffeine is a mild diuretic, vigil says, you will not lose more fluid through urine than you take in by drinking a caffeinated beverage. your body is able to absorb as much fluid as it needs and expel the rest, he says.   some studies seem to back up this latter view, but they involve healthy individuals.

What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?,"stay aware of the latest information on the covid-19 outbreak, available on the who website and through your national and local public health authority. many countries around the world have seen cases of covid-19 and several have seen outbreaks. authorities in china and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. however, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.      you can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading covid-19 by taking some simple precautions:     regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. why  washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.     maintain at least 1 metre  3 feet  distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. why  when someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. if you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the covid-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.     avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. why  hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. from there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.     make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. this means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. then dispose of the used tissue immediately. why  droplets spread virus. by following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and covid-19.     stay home if you feel unwell. if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. follow the directions of your local health authority. why  national and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area.      calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. this will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.      keep up to date on the latest covid-19 hotspots  cities or local areas where covid-19 is spreading widely . if possible, avoid traveling to places - especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. why  you have a higher chance of catching covid-19 in one of these areas.",46
"There is a fundamental discrepancy or paradox that has been keeping myself, and many others, away from the stock market. Before I explain it, let me mention some selected popular questions on this site in which the consensus is that in the long term a broad investment in the stock market will yield a substantially positive average annual return rate:

Why should we expect stocks to go up in the long term?

Why do people claim that Stock Markets are broadly exponential in the long term?

Why isn't everybody rich?

Stock market long term risks

Is it a lie that you can easily make money passively in the stock market?

Are Index Funds really as good as “experts” claim?

In view of all this consensus, we can almost say that it has become ""common knowledge"" that investing in the broad stock market (sufficient diversification) on a long term perspective (several decades) is a very good investment strategy. More precisely, the consensus seems to be that there is some average annual return rate, say 3% (replace this number by something higher/lower if you prefer), such that if your investment is diversified enough and your timespan is long enough, the risk that your actual average annual return rate drops below that rate tends towards zero.

Now comes the first question: Why doesn't any (serious) bank offer a savings account with a fixed 2% interest rate for an unlimited amount of time? 

After all, a large bank has the optimal prerequisites for diversification and holding stocks for many decades, and if the above is true, then they would still earn at least 1% of their customer's account values each year by essentially doing not very much except buying and selling some index funds according to what customers want to withdraw or pay in. 

My own first objection to the question would be the following: If there is a market crash and at the same time a lot of customers want to withdraw money from their accounts, the bank might be in big trouble because the total value of the stocks owned by the bank could be less than what the customers want to withdraw.

However, I feel that this is not really an objection because even without the above ""obvious product"" banks will always be in trouble if their customers want to withdraw too much money at once. 

What's bothering me even more is the

Second question: Why don't all banks borrow a huge amount of money from the central bank and invest it in the stock market on a broad, long-term basis? 

As far as I know, banks can borrow money from the central bank at quite low interest rates (much less than the expected long-term average annual return rate of the broad stock market), in Europe that interest rate is currently even negative. So why don't all banks just buy index funds using this free money and just hold them forever, watching them grow in value?



Edit: After the first few answers (and some downvotes) I immediately realized that it was a big mistake to specialize the question in the sense that I only asked why banks don't do the ""obvious"" things, rather than having simply asked why no-one or  no specialized company does the ""obvious"" things. I am very glad that in the further course of events my question was received in a slightly more abstract way. Thank you all for your answers and upvotes, earning me a gold badge with my very first question on this site! If one could only trade in those badges for their real world counterparts... ;-)
","fundamentally, i think there is a high level  and perhaps unsatisfying  answer to this. it is because that is not  banking  as a business, and a bank is established to do banking, not to get into the stock market. in other words, this question strikes me about the same as asking,    why do not ice cream shops stop selling ice cream, and instead get in the business of selling pancakes  after all, you can make a lot of money selling pancakes.   well yes, you can get rich selling pancakes, but not every business is a pancake shop. certainly, some businesses get rich selling pancakes, but other businesses with different motivations and risk tolerances decide to sell ice cream instead.  to make this clear in your banking context: such a business would essentially be called a hedge fund or investment management company, not a bank. it is fine if a company wants to be a hedge fund, but a company that is calling itself a bank can not secretly switch over to being a hedge fund, and still call itself a bank while supporting  banking  activities for normal consumers.  from a more practical perspective, most jurisdictions have carefully developed regulations that would essentially prohibit a business calling itself a bank from doing what you are discussing. essentially, these regulations exist because of my first point - the business model you are describing is not  banking.  and, regulations are designed around that, in the sense that regulations keep banks acting like banks and stop them from trying to act like something that is not a bank.  i am editing to clarify a portion of your question, as an example of this disconnect. you said,    as far as i know, banks can borrow money from the central bank at quite low interest rates   that is not really the whole story. think of it this way. imagine if you were to walk into a retail bank right now, and ask for a loan for a million dollars. the bank would certainly ask you some questions, including asking what you intended to do with that money and how you could show proof that you are able to pay it back. if you were able to prove that you have a large and stable income, and that you were planning on using the million dollars to purchase a home that is actually worth a million dollars, you might get approved. but what if you told the bank,  i am actually empty handed, but i am going to go invest this in the stock market, i think i have a proven way to make a positive return  - they might deny you on the spot, or at least they might have a lot more questions for you   the relationship between central banks and retail banks is fundamentally similar. a retail bank can not just call up the central bank and say,  please wire me a billion dollars  and instantly, the money shows up. retail banks essentially have to go through a process of validating their operational intentions, showing proof that they can pay the loan back, and perhaps even putting up collateral, before the money changes hands. and, a retail bank with no collateral who indicated that they wanted to play the stock market would almost certainly get turned down by the central bank.  i am making another edit to address another core flaw in your assumptions. you said,    we can almost say that it has become  common knowledge  that investing in the broad stock market  sufficient diversification  on a long term perspective  several decades  is a very good investment strategy   while that may be a sound theory it is not a practical method for a bank to keep or invest assets, because of liquidity and predictability. it may be accurate to say that  in the long term  a diversified stock portfolio can be bulletproof. but banks can not issue cash to deposit customers based on long term theories. they have to be able to predict the availability of funds very well - the stability of their outcomes, not just the expected result. in other words, if a bank has  10 billion in assets, they need to know precisely how much of that will be available to them tomorrow, or next tuesday, or in six months. your stock market theory may have the right expected outcome  positive growth , but it is got far too much potential variance on any particular day. yes,  in the long run  you may make money, but can you tell me exactly how much cash you will have next tuesday  no, you can not. you might have an acceptable expected outcome on average for all  next tuesdays  - but what if coronavirus takes off in the us this weekend  or something else happens  banks are not just concerned about the expected outcome, they are also concerned about variability in the range of expected outcomes. people do  banking activities  like deposit their paycheck into a deposit account, or take out a credit card loan, with the expectation of stability and availability of funds. those  features  which are essentially the definition of retail banking come as a trade off in terms of a slightly lower return  compared to your stock market portfolio .

"This article describes the efforts of several European Union countries to agree to issue ""corona bonds"" or ""Eurobonds"", which are a joint EU mechanism to issue joint debt shared between different countries. This measure is being proposed in order to ""mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus"". It says:


  “We need to recognize the severity of the situation and the necessity
  for further action to buttress our economies today,” the heads of
  state of Italy, France, Belgium, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Ireland,
  Slovenia and Luxembourg said Wednesday in a joint letter seen by CNBC.
  
  [...]
  
  “We need to work on a common debt instrument issued by a European
  institution to raise funds on the market on the same basis and to the
  benefits of all Member States,” the nine heads of state said.


Given that there doesn't seem to be any restriction on European Union countries issuing their own government bonds, what are the benefits of these new proposed instruments over this conventional measure?
","expanding on the answer by tin nguyen, the euro is a a common currency for nations with separate economic policies and separate national debts. being a member of the eurozone stops nations from devaluating their currency to compensate for changing economic fundamentals.  before and during the 2007 financial crisis bonds from e.g. greece or italy had a risk premium compared to german bonds despite the fact that both were government bonds in the same currency. there were even signs that futures traders were driving this premium up by betting against certain governments, or on nations leaving the eurozone. the famous  whatever it takes  speech by draghi calmed that.  the financial consequences of the corona pandemic are not yet known, but it is clear that italy and spain will be hit hard. that will increase the risk on a default on national debt which increases the interest which investors demand. of course that further hinders economic recovery.  if the eurozone members jointly guarantee bonds, that lowers the interest payments for the less stable economies and possibly increases the interest for the more stable ones. this might or might not be to the benefit of the eu as a whole and the stronger members individually  since they all benefit from a strong eurozone , but the more or less clearly voiced suspicion is that corona is used as an excuse to enact a permanent transfer mechanism.

I am under 28, male and have no disease or anything similar - as far as I know, anyway. 
I intended to travel to Barcelona from 15th March to 05th April, 
getting there by train via Hannover-Cologne (ICE), Cologne-Brussels (ICE),  Brussels-Paris (Thalys) and Paris-Barcelona (TGV). On the return journey: Barcelona-Paris (TGV), Paris-Frankfurt (TGV), Frankfurt-Hannover (IC). 
The plan was to go to a language school by midday and in the afternoon, get to know Barcelona itself. This trip is being offered by my scholarship that I have for my studies. 
I haven't reached out to them yet, because usually, if canceling a trip to a a language school, they require you to pay the entire fee of 1,000 € (no spelling error), unless you prove you were ill (by going to a doctor). But maybe, they make an exception due to the circumstances - I think I should reach out to them soon. 
I currently live in Germany in a big city and my dad is a taxi driver who often has guests from the airport as well, so the question is: Aren't I equally exposed to the Corona-virus in Germany, i.e. at home? 
On the 6th April, my term officially starts, and from mid-April, I wanted to start my Bachelor Thesis, so it would be great if I weren't in quarantine in April. 
Also, I care about getting the virus to my home community - I mean, who doesn't? But then, the question is, shouldn't my dad stop taxi driving for a while? I told him my opinion, but he said we need money for a living. 
I have already booked the tickets for 360€ and after having informed myself, I probably would get back only 44€. However, I understandably don't care about the money right now. 


EDIT: Alright, I searched for an alternative and found one: I could take a ""Flixbus"" from Frankfurt (Main) Central Station to Barcelona directly and vice versa. The costs for the entire trip would be around 100€, and I can get easily from Hannover to Frankfurt/from Frankfurt to Hannover with an IC(E). However, the only question is whether I have to travel or not ... I mean, if the situation should escalate in Barcelona/Spain/Europe, then I could be in quarantine and that wouldn't be great. 

EDIT EDIT: If sb wants to now, I decided to cancel my trip. I will lose around 1,050 € at least, since my scholarship isn't ready to officially cancel the trip.

","spain itself does not seem particularly risky, it is not the country most impacted in europe, it has fewer cases than either france or germany, most of them tourists or imported cases and is not considered a  risk area .  still, there are several things to be aware of:   traveling in general does increase your exposure  to this and other viruses , you would be spending hours in enclosed spaces and at times crowded public transportation, which, everything else being equal, is riskier than staying at home in either of the countries you would be crossing. the itinerary you describe would have you going through france, which is developing into one of the most severely affected countries in europe. there are several clusters whose source has not been fully elucidated, including one very close to paris. at this moment, the french government does not advise against travel in general  only in the oise and haute-savoie departement  but the situation could evolve quickly. it did activate  stage 2  of its emergency plan meaning the virus is circulating through the population and the focus is on slowing it down rather than isolating clusters and risk areas. if the situation worsens, you could conceivably be putting others at risk. there are few restrictions on travel in europe and blanket bans or border closures seem unlikely but if anything, spanish authorities should be more concerned about people like you coming from france than you should be about being in spain. it is possible the outbreak would develop further while you are in spain to the point of making your return more difficult or, indeed, mean isolation would be recommended when coming back to germany. you cannot know this before leaving  and i speak from experience as this just happened to me coming back from italy .

When will there be a vaccine?,"a covid-19 vaccine is probably still at least a year away. the university of queensland has developed a vaccine candidate, and it is being tested on animals at the moment. human clinical trials will follow in a few months if the vaccine looks like it is going to be effective. but getting a vaccine to the market is a slow process, because health authorities have to be 100 per cent sure it is safe. even once a vaccine is shown to work and to be safe, scaling up production of the vaccine can take time, so it will probably be a year to 18 months before a vaccine will be available.",15
Help me understand the economic fallout.,"it is felt a lot like 2008, has not it  peter s. goodman, an economics correspondent for the times, says there is a key difference between that economic turmoil and today is: the utter unpredictability of the outbreak is spread.  the disaster feels eerily familiar, with trillions of dollars in wealth annihilated near-daily and deepening fears that businesses will fail,   he writes  http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/business/coronavirus-global- economy.html .  yet the traditional policy prescriptions seem no match for the affliction at hand.  the very means of controlling the health crisis -- keeping workers home, limiting travel and disrupting commerce -- risk making the economic crisis worse.  a sense of powerlessness is feeding the fear that is prompting investors to dump anything risky, which is in turn damaging economic prospects and reinforcing fear -- a feedback loop,  he writes.",148

How deadly is the virus?,"we do not entirely know yet. of the 81,191 confirmed cases, 2,768 people have died, a mortality rate of about 3 percent. that would be worse than the spanish flu, which had a mortality rate of about 2 percent, and substantially worse than a more ordinary influenza, which kills between one in a thousand and one in ten thousand people. but there are lots of unknowns. first, the bad news: only about 30,000 people have recovered from the virus, which leaves 50,000 or so still in some stage of treatment. not all of those people will recover, so the mortality rate is expected to rise at least a little bit. now, the good news: that 81,191 figure represents only the number of confirmed cases. it appears likely that many thousands more were infected and either did not suffer symptoms or suffered symptoms too minor to seek treatment. in that case, the mortality rate is probably substantially lower than the statistics make it seem.",70

"I first learned the logistic function in machine learning course, where it is just a function that map a real number to 0 to 1. We can use calculus to get its derivative and use the derivative for some optimization tasks.

Later, I learned it in statistic literature where there are log odds and bunch of probabilistic interpretations. 

Today I am reviewing some differential equation literature, and found the logistic function is a solution for the following system:

$y'=y(1-y)$, and $y(0)=0.5$.



So, my question is more like a ""chicken and egg"" problem: where does the logistic function come from? Do we first have the function or the ODE?
","i read from strogatz is book that it was originated from modeling the human populations by verhulst in 1838. assume the population size is  n t  , then the per capita growth rate is   dot n t /n t  . by assuming the per capita growth rate descreases linearly with the population size, we can have the logistic equation of following form:    dot n t  rn 1- frac n  k  ,   where  k  is carrying capacity of the environment. from the equation, we can see that when  n  is very small, the population grows approximately exponentially. as  n  grows until half of the capacity, the derivative   dot n  is still increasing but slows down. once  n  passes the half line, the derivative decreases so we can see a bending curve  we can see this actually from coronavirus cases  and the population asymptotically approaches the capacity. up to this point, we observe the properties of a logistic function. intuitively, when  n  is larger the capacity, the population decreases. by further mathematical simplification of the equation, we have an equation like this:    frac df x   dx  f x  1-f x  ,   which has analytical solotion as:   f x   frac e x  e x   c .   with  c 1  we have the logistic function.

","no, it is not about coronavirus. neither is  the eyes of darkness  by dean r koontz. coronavirus is actually a fairly well-known virus that has been around for quite some time. the cdc defines it as:    coronaviruses  cov  are a large family of viruses that cause illness  ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as middle  east respiratory syndrome  mers-cov  and severe acute respiratory  syndrome  sars-cov . a novel coronavirus  ncov  is a new strain that  has not been previously identified in humans.     coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between  animals and people. detailed investigations found that sars-cov was  transmitted from civet cats to humans and mers-cov from dromedary  camels to humans. several known coronaviruses are circulating in  animals that have not yet infected humans.   it is not uncommon to have a virus be very widespread and infect humans via an animal host. aids is also a virus which is believed to have spawned from animal to human contact.

"I have observed a strange phenomenon. I my mouth is very sensitive to very hot liquids (like, freshly made tea, or just freshly boiled water), so when I make my tea, I usually wait around 20 minutes before drinking it.

I am also a fan of a particular 3 in 1 instant coffee (3 in 1 meaning instant coffe + instant milk + sugar). I am taking one pack of mentioned coffee (21 grams in one package), pouring it with with freshly boiled water, mixing the coffee with water using a teaspoon in room-temperatured cup, then I am going to the toilet for ~5-7 minutes. When I come back from the toilet, my coffee is ready to drink. It is hottish, but I can drink it right away.

Later on (2-3 hours later), I am making a cup of tea, using the same cup, which is in the room temperature again. I am pouring two teabags (4 grams of tea) with the same amount of freshly boiled water, and I make my breakfast. It usually takes me around 10 minutes to make my breakfast, and when I am trying to drink my tea right after finishing making by breakfast, it is still hot as hell. I am usually waiting another 10 minutes, then the tea is still hotter than the coffee after 7 minutes, but it starts being acceptable for my sensitive mouth.

I have even bought a food thermometer to check the cooling speed of both liquids, but because of the coronavirus outbreak it hasn't arrived yet, but my ""internal"" thermometer - my lips, and isides of my mouth cannot be wrong. I can drink the coffee after ~7 minutes, and the tea after ~20.

I would understand a little change in cooling time, cause we are talking about 21 grams of instant coffee-sugar-powdered mix, the liquid is a bit densier, maybe there is more energy used to dissolve the coffee ingredients, the instant milk contains fat, but still - i am talking here about 13 minutes of difference between the time when my mouth can accept the temperature of both liquids, and we have to remember that the tea is still a hotter 20 minutes after I pour it with boiling water than the coffee 7 minutes, but it is drinkable.

Is there an explaination for this?
","i can think of two possible differences which might contribute this result, but i am not sure how you could test them. the different composition of the drinks will affect the surface tension. this could affect the rate of evaporation of the liquid. if this is the case, it may make a substantial difference to the rate of cooling as evaporation is probably the greatest cause of loss of temperature.  the other cooling effect which will be different is radiation. do you add milk to your tea  if the coffee is darker than the tea, it will radiate faster and cool faster for that reason.   if you do not add milk, the tea will be translucent. i am not exactly sure how that will affect things, because it means that radiation is possible from the interior, not just the surface. also it may not be translucent for the wavelengths radiated. but generally, i think a translucent substance will radiate much less.

"Romania has declared a state of emergency because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has a few effects. Two of which I consider relevant for this questions are:


they limit some of people's rights (like the right to move freely, for ex);
some decisions can badly affect certain categories of people (lose jobs, unable to get access to care, difficulty in access food, for ex).


Old people are the most affected and in extreme situations. They might die not because of the virus, but because of decisions that are taken to slow down the progression of the virus, like being unable to access care, or medicine, or food because people are restricted in what they can do and health services are restricted in what cases they treat.

My question is this: If Romanian politicians take bad decisions, or police and military enforce bad decisions and this causes deaths that could have been avoided if they had more... ""common sense"" let's say... after the state of emergency ends, are they accountable for their actions? Or does anything go during a state of emergency with no consequences for those in power?
","the general answer to this, which applies in most democratic countries, is that governments are not legally responsible for  bad  decisions, whether made during a state of emergency or not. the main reasons for this are:   who is to say what is a  bad  decision  it is rarely obvious, even with 20/20 hindsight, and the general view is that the electorate is responsible for deciding, which means: the redress for governments who make bad decisions is that at the next election the people will vote them out.   that said, a state of emergency does not mean  anything goes . governments are still responsible for illegal actions. if a government ordered random shootings of innocent people in the street that would still be illegal, even in a state of emergency, and any soldier who carried out such an action could be prosecuted. a state of emergency extends what is legal, but does not extend it indefinitely. it might be legal to force the closure of businesses in a state of emergency, but not to kill random people.

Question: Why does the Wuhan coronavirus genome end in 33 a's?
","good observation  the 3  poly a  tail is actually a very common feature of positive-strand rna viruses, including coronaviruses and picornaviruses.  for coronaviruses in particular, we know that the poly a  tail is required for replication, functioning in conjunction with the 3  untranslated region  utr  as a cis-acting signal for negative strand synthesis and attachment to the ribosome during translation. mutants lacking the poly a  tail are severely compromised in replication. jeannie spagnolo and brenda hogue report:    the 3  poly  a  tail plays an important, but as yet undefined role in coronavirus genome replication. to further examine the requirement for the coronavirus poly a  tail, we created truncated poly a  mutant defective interfering  di  rnas and observed the effects on replication. bovine coronavirus  bcv  and mouse hepatitis coronavirus a59  mhv-a59  di rnas with tails of 5 or 10 a residues were replicated, albeit at delayed kinetics as compared to di rnas with wild type tail lengths   50 a residues . a bcv di rna lacking a poly a  tail was unable to replicate  however, a mhv di lacking a tail did replicate following multiple virus passages. poly a  tail extension/repair was concurrent with robust replication of the tail mutants. binding of the host factor poly a - binding protein  pabp  appeared to correlate with the ability of di rnas to be replicated. poly a  tail mutants that were compromised for replication, or that were unable to replicate at all exhibited less in vitro pabp interaction. the data support the importance of the poly a  tail in coronavirus replication and further delineate the minimal requirements for viral genome propagation.    spagnolo j.f., hogue b.g.  2001  requirement of the poly a  tail in coronavirus genome replication. in: lavi e., weiss s.r., hingley s.t.  eds  the nidoviruses. advances in experimental medicine and biology, vol 494. springer, boston, ma   yu-hui peng et al. also report that the length of the poly a  tail is regulated during infection:    similar to eukaryotic mrna, the positive-strand coronavirus genome of  30 kilobases is 5 -capped and 3 -polyadenylated. it has been demonstrated that the length of the coronaviral poly a  tail is not static but regulated during infection  however, little is known regarding the factors involved in coronaviral polyadenylation and its regulation. here, we show that during infection, the level of coronavirus poly a  tail lengthening depends on the initial length upon infection and that the minimum length to initiate lengthening may lie between 5 and 9 nucleotides. by mutagenesis analysis, it was found that  i  the hexamer aguaaa and poly a  tail are two important elements responsible for synthesis of the coronavirus poly a  tail and may function in concert to accomplish polyadenylation and  ii  the function of the hexamer aguaaa in coronaviral polyadenylation is position dependent. based on these findings, we propose a process for how the coronaviral poly a  tail is synthesized and undergoes variation. our results provide the first genetic evidence to gain insight into coronaviral polyadenylation.    peng y-h, lin c-h, lin c-n, lo c-y, tsai t-l, wu h-y  2016  characterization of the role of hexamer aguaaa and poly a  tail in coronavirus polyadenylation. plos one 11 10 : e0165077   this builds upon prior work by hung-yi wu et al, which showed that the coronaviral 3  poly a  tail is approximately 65 nucleotides in length in both genomic and sgmrnas at peak viral rna synthesis, and also observed that the precise length varied throughout infection. most interestingly, they report:    functional analyses of poly a  tail length on specific viral rna species, furthermore, revealed that translation, in vivo, of rnas with the longer poly a  tail was enhanced over those with the shorter poly a . although the mechanisms by which the tail lengths vary is unknown, experimental results together suggest that the length of the poly a  and poly u  tails is regulated. one potential function of regulated poly a  tail length might be that for the coronavirus genome a longer poly a  favors translation. the regulation of coronavirus translation by poly a  tail length resembles that during embryonal development suggesting there may be mechanistic parallels.    wu hy, ke ty, liao wy, chang ny. regulation of coronaviral poly a  tail length during infection. plos one. 2013 8 7 :e70548. published 2013 jul 29. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0070548   it is also worth pointing out that poly a  tails at the 3  end of rna are not an unusual feature of viruses. eukaryotic mrna almost always contains poly a  tails, which are added post-transcriptionally in a process known as polyadenylation. it should not therefore be surprising that positive-strand rna viruses would have poly a  tails as well. in eukaryotic mrna, the central sequence motif for identifying a polyadenylation region is aauaaa, identified way back in the 1970s, with more recent research confirming its ubiquity. proudfoot 2011 is a nice review article on poly a  signals in eukaryotic mrna.

"Coronavirus has forced the French government to postpone the second round of local elections:


  France will postpone the second round of mayoral elections to June 21 due to the coronavirus outbreak, two political sources told Reuters on Monday.
  
  Sources also said that the results of first round of local elections on Sunday would remain valid.


However, nobody really knows how long SARS-CoV-2 will be a major issue. Theoretically, the desired scenario implies mitigating the infections over a large period of time to allow the medical system to cope with the patients. 

I am wondering if the second round can be postponed indefinitely.

Question: Is there a limit to how long the second round of French mayoral elections can be postponed?
","there is no limit because there is also no provision for that. article l56 of the code electoral even provides that:    en cas de deuxieme tour de scrutin, il y est procede le dimanche suivant le premier tour.   in other words, any run-off has to take place the week after the first round of voting.  but, absent any constitutional provision to the contrary, anything and everything that is defined in a statute can in principle be undone by the parliament. postponing the run-off at the last minute is a very ad hoc solution, not something that would be part of a well-defined procedure.  at this point, the government rescinded the decret calling the election and the parliament  both chambers  adopted a statute dealing with several issues arising from this  what to do with the results, etc.  in fact, that statute also extends the term of all town councils that have not been replaced, as it could otherwise be deemed to expire.  it also provides that before setting a new date the government must publish the conclusions of its advisory scientific committee and that if it turns out to be impossible to organise the run-off in june then the election would be completely cancelled and the process should be restarted from scratch  new candidates, new ballots, new campaign, etc.   obviously, from a purely legal point of view, all these dispositions are also liable to be changed at any time should the parliament agree to do so.

I also tried fitting with GAs (as in the paper), also to no avail.

My question
Am I making any mistakes or is there just not enough data yet? Or is the SIR model too simple? I would appreciate suggestions on how to change the code so that I get some sensible numbers out of it.

Addendum
I wrote a blog post based on the final model and current data: Epidemiology: How contagious is Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?
","there are several points that you can improve in the code   wrong boundary conditions  your model is fixed to i 1 for time zero. you can either changes this point to the observed value or add a parameter in the model that shifts the time accordingly.  init  lt - c s   n-1, i   1, r   0     should be  init  lt - c s   n-infected 1 , i   infected 1 , r   0    unequal parameter scales  as other people have noted the equation     i     beta  cdot s  cdot i -  gamma  cdot i    has a very large value for  s  cdot i  this makes that the value of the parameter   beta  very small and the algorithm which checks whether the step sizes in the iterations reach some point will not vary the steps in   beta  and   gamma  equally  the changes in   beta  will have a much larger effect than changes in   gamma  .   you can change scale in the call to the optim function to correct for these differences in size  and checking the hessian allows you to see whether it works a bit . this is done by using a control parameter. in addition you might want to solve the function in segregated steps making the optimization of the two parameters independent from each others  see more here: how to deal with unstable estimates during curve fitting  this is also done in the code below, and the result is much better convergence  although still you reach the limits of your lower and upper bounds   opt  lt - optim c 2 coefficients mod  2 /n, coefficients mod  2  , rss.sir, method    l-bfgs-b , lower   lower, upper   upper,  hessian   true, control   list parscale   c 1/n,1 ,factr   1     more intuitive might be to scale the parameter in the function  note the term beta/n in place of beta   sir  lt - function time, state, parameters     par  lt - as.list c state, parameters    with par,   ds  lt - -beta/n   s   i  di  lt - beta/n   s   i - gamma   i  dr  lt - gamma   i  list c ds, di, dr           starting condition  because the value of  s  is in the beginning more or less constant  namely  s  approx n   the expression for the infected in the beginning can be solved as a single equation:    i   approx   beta  cdot n -  gamma   cdot i     so you can find a starting condition using an initial exponential fit:    get a good starting condition mod  lt - nls infected   a exp b day ,   start   list a   infected 1 ,  b   log infected 2 /infected 1       unstable, correlation between   beta  and   gamma   there is a bit of ambiguity how to choose   beta  and   gamma  for the starting condition.   this will also make the outcome of your analysis not so stable. the error in the individual parameters   beta  and   gamma  will be very large because many pairs of   beta  and   gamma  will give a more or less similarly low rss.   the plot below is for the solution   beta   0.8310849   gamma   0.4137507      however the adjusted opt par value   beta   0.8310849-0.2   gamma   0.4137507-0.2  works just as well:      using a different parameterization  the optim function allows you to read out the hessian   gt  opt  lt - optim optimsstart, rss.sir, method    l-bfgs-b , lower   lower, upper   upper,   hessian   true   gt  opt hessian  b  b 7371274104 -7371294772  -7371294772 7371315619   the hessian can be related to the variance of the parameters  in r, given an output from optim with a hessian matrix, how to calculate parameter confidence intervals using the hessian matrix  . but note that for this purpose you need the hessian of the log likelihood which is not the same as the the rss  it differs by a factor, see the code below .  based on this you can see that the estimate of the sample variance of the parameters is very large  which means that your results/estimates are not very accurate . but also note that the error is a lot correlated. this means that you can change the parameters such that the outcome is not very correlated. some example parameterization would be:     begin array     c  amp   amp   beta -  gamma     r 0  amp   amp   frac  beta   gamma   end array     such that the old equations  note a scaling by 1/n is used :     begin array  rccl  s  prime  amp   amp  -  beta  frac s  n  amp  i   i  prime  amp   amp    beta  frac s  n - gamma  amp  i   r  prime  amp   amp   gamma  amp i  end array      become     begin array  rccl  s  prime  amp   amp  -c frac r 0  r 0-1   frac s  n  amp  i amp    i  prime  amp   amp  c frac  s/n  r 0 - 1  r 0-1   amp i amp   underbrace  approx c i    text for  t 0  when  s/n  approx 1      r  prime  amp   amp  c  frac 1  r 0-1  amp  i amp   end array      which is especially appealing since you get this approximate  i  prime   ci  for the beginning. this will make you see that you are basically estimating the first part which is approximately exponential growth. you will be able to very accurately determine the growth parameter,  c    beta -  gamma . however,   beta  and   gamma , or  r 0 , can not be easily determined.  in the code below a simulation is made with the same value  c  beta -  gamma  but with different values for  r 0    beta /  gamma . you can see that the data is not capable to allow us differentiate which different scenario is  which different  r 0   we are dealing with  and we would need more information, e.g. the locations of each infected individual and trying to see how the infection spread out .  it is interesting that several articles already pretend to have reasonable estimates of  r 0 . for instance this preprint novel coronavirus 2019-ncov: early estimation of epidemiological parameters and epidemic predictions  http://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549       some code:                  library desolve  library rcolorbrewer    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline of the 2019 e2 80 9320 wuhan coronavirus outbreak cases chronology in mainland china infected  lt -

"Let's say 15 minutes after a person coughs or sneezes, where does the droplet go? Up in the air and down to the ground? Is it different inside a building?
","data suggests droplets remain in the air up to 3 hours, and longer for droplet nuclei. where they go depends on the local temperatures, humidity and air flows.    the image shows a cough on the left and a sneeze on the right.     currently, the term droplet is often taken to refer to droplets  5 mm in diameter that fall rapidly to the ground under gravity, and therefore are transmitted only over a limited distance  e.g.   1 m . in contrast, the term droplet nuclei refers to droplets   5 mm in diameter that can remain suspended in air for significant periods of time, allowing them to be transmitted over distances  1 m  stetzenbach, buttner  amp  cruz, 2004  wong  amp  leung, 2004 . other studies suggest slightly different definitions, with ranges for  large  droplets,  small  droplets and droplet nuclei being  60 mm in diameter,   60 mm in diameter and  lt 10 mm in diameter, respectively  tang et al., 2006  xie et al., 2007 . the concept is that the naturally and artificially produced aerosols will contain a range of droplet sizes, whose motion will depend significantly on various environmental factors, such as gravity, the direction and strength of local airflows, temperature and relative humidity  which will affect both the size and mass of the droplet due to evaporation .   oops, breathing and talking can produce droplets yet health authorities continue to claim that masks are not needed  to stop wearers from broadcasting droplets into the environment     humans can produce respiratory aerosols  droplets  by several means, including breathing, talking, coughing  figure c.1, a , sneezing  figure c.1, b  and even singing  wong, 2003  toth et al., 2004 .   we are being told that the main droplets are the larger ones being emitted but talking for 5 mins can produce droplet nuclei the same as a cough    published data have suggested that sneezing may produce as many as 40 000 droplets between 0.5-12 mm in diameter  cole  amp  cook, 1998  tang et al., 2006  that may be expelled at speeds up to 100 m/s  wells, 1955  cole  amp  cook, 1998 , whereas coughing may produce up to 3000 droplet nuclei, about the same number as talking for five minutes  cole  amp  cook, 1998  fitzgerald  amp  haas, 2005  tang et al., 2006 . despite the variety in size, large droplets comprise most of the total volume of expelled respiratory droplets. further data on the behaviour of droplet dispersion in naturally generated aerosols are needed.   small droplets fall to the ground where they dry up before they reach the ground but some become droplet nuclei on their way down which allows them to remain airborne    in the classic study of airborne transmission, wells  1934  was able to identify the difference between disease transmission via large droplets and by airborne routes. wells found that, under normal air conditions, droplets smaller than 100 mm in diameter would completely dry out before falling approximately 2 m to the ground. this finding allowed the establishment of the theory of droplets and droplet nuclei transmission depending on the size of the infected droplet. the wells evaporation-falling curve of droplets  see figure c.2  is important in understanding airborne transmission and transmission by large droplets. wells  study also demonstrated that droplets could transform into droplet nuclei by evaporation.   and what happens to droplet nuclei    droplet nuclei floating on the air may be carried by the movement of air. entrainment of air into neighbouring airspaces may occur during the most innocuous daily activities  for example, as a result of people walking, or the opening of a door between a room and the adjacent corridor or space  hayden et al., 1998  edge, paterson  amp  settles, 2005  tang et al., 2005, 2006 . in addition, the air temperature  and therefore air density  differences across an open doorway will also cause air exchange to occur between the two areas, providing a second mechanism to allow air into other areas  tang et al., 2005, 2006   see figure c.3 .   which is why they use negative pressure rooms when doing a procedure that can form aerosols  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/nbk143281/ ",94
"For what I read [1], Covid19 can persist active in a common freezer for months or years (it seems pretty obvious: cold, humid...). My question does not regard only the currently active coronavirus at this posting date, but any.

So, I imagine that if the surface of a bottle or bag is contaminated, taking it, a month later will start the spreading mechanism, don't know, hands, surfaces, face, etc. And the virus will spread internally in the refrigerator, given that common refrigerators have channels that spill drops which flow through the cold and warm refrigerating sections. Or internal ventilators.

Under such perspective, a common refrigerator would act moreover as a Petri dish. Completely different from the rest of house surfaces, which would allow viruses vanishing way more faster.

If that is so, is it possible to clean a fridge from coronavirus? Do common refrigerators increase the risk of propagation?

","since the virus replicates via human cells, how do you expect it to proliferate inside a refrigerator  and if you had human tissue  lungs, hearts, kidney, bowel  in your fridge, it still needs to be alive to proliferate as it hijacks the living cells intra-cellular machinery.  so, you are not going to get any more virus out than you put in. therefore if you disinfect before you put it into the fridge, you will not get any virus out.  if you are talking about the infected deceased coming out of the mortuary fridge    there is no evidence so far of transmission of sars-cov-2 through the handling of bodies of deceased persons.  the potential risk of transmission related to the handling of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or  confirmed covid-19 is considered low and can be related to:    direct contact with human remains or bodily fluids where the virus is present    direct contact with contaminated fomites.    as viable sars-cov-2 may persist on surfaces for days  7 , there is the possibility that the virus also persists on  deceased bodies. therefore, unnecessary contact with bodies should be minimised by those not wearing personal  protective equipment  ppe . those in direct contact with deceased cases of covid-19  both suspected or  confirmed  should be protected from exposure to infected bodily fluids, contaminated objects, or other  contaminated environmental surfaces through wearing of appropriate ppe. minimum requirements include gloves  and a long-sleeved water-resistant gown.   http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-safe-handling-of-bodies-or-persons-dying-from-covid19.pdf ",36

Coronavirus is an RNA virus, so I was expecting the sequence to consist of AUGC characters. But the letters here are ATGC, which looks like DNA!

I found a possible answer, that this is the sequence of a ""complementary DNA"". I read that


  The term cDNA is also used, typically in a bioinformatics context, to refer to an mRNA transcript's sequence, expressed as DNA bases (GCAT) rather than RNA bases (GCAU).


However, I don't believe this theory that I'm looking at a cDNA. If this were true, the end of the true mRNA sequence would be ...UCUUACUGUUUUUUUUUUUU, or a ""poly(U)"" tail. But I believe the coronavirus has a poly(A) tail.

I also found that the start of all highlighted genes begin with the sequence ATG. This is the DNA equivalent of the RNA start codon AUG.

So, I believe what I'm looking at is the true mRNA, in 5'→3' direction, but with all U converted to T.

So, is this really what I'm looking at? Is this some formatting/representation issue? Or does 2019-nCoV really contain DNA, rather than RNA?
","that is the correct sequence for 2019-ncov. coronavirus is of course an rna virus and in fact, to my knowledge, every rna virus in genbank is present as cdna  agct, i.e. thydmine  and not rna  agcu, i.e. uracil .  the reason is simple, we never sequence directly from rna because rna is too unstable and easily degraded by rnase. instead the genome is reverse transcribed, either by targeted reverse transcription or random amplification and thus converted to cdna. cdna is stable and is essentially reverse transcribed rna.  the cdna is either sequenced directly or further amplified by pcr and then sequenced. hence the sequence we observe is the cdna rather than rna, thus we observe thymine rather than uracil and that is how it is reported.

"I made a non-refundable hotel room booking through the hotel website. The hotel is located in the Netherlands.

Two days ago, a hotel manager informed me that they close the hotel for a certain period that included the period of my stay due to the Coronavirus, and that is why they were forced to move my reservation to another date. However, I do not want to move my reservation and would like to get the money back because I did not cancel my reservation, so I informed the hotel about it. The hotel, however, states that they are forced to move my reservation to another date as I made a non-refundable booking.

I checked the official website of the government of the Netherlands as was advised here and the rules of the hotel on their website but have not found anything on this matter. The rules, however, are on Dutch, so I could misunderstand or skip something (I do not speak Dutch at all).
As far as I understand the situation based on John's question and answers, I am entitled to a refund. Are there some documents that I can cite to the hotel to get a refund?

Can face coverings prevent the spread of the virus?,"the primary benefit of covering your nose and mouth is that you protect others. while there is still much to be learned about the novel coronavirus, it appears that many people who are infected are shedding the virus - through coughs, sneezes and other respiratory droplets - for 48 hours before they start feeling sick. and others who have the virus - up to 25 , according to centers for disease control and prevention director dr. robert redfield -- may never feel symptoms but may still play a role in transmitting it. that is why wearing a mask even if you do not feel sick can be a good idea. if you cough or sneeze, the mask can catch those respiratory droplets so they do not land on other people or surfaces.  so it is not going to protect you, but it is going to protect your neighbor,  says dr. daniel griffin at columbia university, an expert on infectious diseases.  if your neighbor is wearing a mask and the same thing happens, they are going to protect you. so masks worn properly have the potential to benefit people.  the best masks are n95 respirators, but the general public is urged not to use them because they are fiercely needed by health care workers right now. if you have those, consider donating them immediately to a local hospital or find a drop-off here. same goes for surgical masks -- those thin blue models-- which offer less protection but are helpful and are also in short supply.",46
"If I read Figure 2 of … the impact of influenza on excess mortality … correctly, the excess mortality due to flu

Is it due to geographical distribution (Lombardy!) which Italy could not compensate by moving resources?  Or is it a different
distribution of deaths vs. being in intensive care?  Or what?
","the big difference in italy today is that many younger, otherwise healthier patients need critical care and more generally that patients need critical care for a long time. these patients are not necessarily dying after they get care, but the extent to which the surviving patients require ventilators and supplemental oxygen is nothing like a seasonal flu and is likely inflating the death rate substantially among those who could otherwise be treated.  from nejm: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmp2005492    contributing to the resource scarcity is the prolonged intubation many of these patients require as they recover from pneumonia -- often 15 to 20 days of mechanical ventilation, with several hours spent in the prone position and then, typically, a very slow weaning. in the midst of the outbreak is peak in northern italy, as physicians struggled to wean patients off ventilators while others developed severe respiratory decompensation, hospitals had to lower the age cutoff -- from 80 to 75 at one hospital, for instance.

Universities Issue Hiring Freezes in Response to COVID-19 
Some offers were withdrawn and one case of layoffs- see comments

","of all the examples you name, i think only those on annual contracts have much of any risk and i think that is small. the world is not actually ending. universities still have their mission s : teaching, research, service. that will not change unless the disruptions are much worse than are now foreseen or even likely.   course delivery is being affected, but has not ended. research goes on, though interrupted/slowed in some fields for safety. funding for research is still in place and will probably continue. it will be a boon for some  biomedical  research.   some marginal colleges will be in trouble. think walden university from the doonesbury comic, but they were in trouble before this began. tenure track professors are unlikely to be affected because they represent the future of the university, not some disposable resource. postdocs have contracts and funding in place for the most part, often by grants.   there is even a chance that the current disruption will increase the need for faculty in the short term.   but for long term effects we need to see how the hundreds to thousands of variables now in play work out over time. and it will take time since universities have quite a bit of built-in inertia. whether  cheap online degrees  have any actual value is something yet to be determined. and they may not be as cheap as you think. some online programs are extremely expensive to create. and the issue of the actual qualifications of those who take them is important and, perhaps, doubtful.   but even if a university were to try to deliver such a  cheap  degree there is the question of still needing to do research and that requires highly qualified personnel. there is not a  cheap online research path  that has and likelihood of success.   diploma mills have a poor history, being more associated with exploitation than with excellence.   relax. stay healthy. do a good job. climate change is a bigger risk than what we are going through in the current months.     some people normally employed by colleges are at risk, of course. the people who clean the dormitories and prepare meals for resident students, for example. lots of service jobs are at risk. likewise, there are lots of small businesses in college towns that are at risk of failure, leaving their employees  including students  without resources.

"Air France states that for COVID-19 related cancellations:


  ""... or complete the online form below to obtain a travel voucher. This voucher is valid for 1 year on all Air France, KLM, Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic flights. This voucher will be refundable after one year if it is not used.""


Source

That seems like a ploy to circumvent EU261 regulations which I believe require a full refund in cases of cancellations. Air France is offering sort of a refund but with one year delay built in. 

Background: we have an US&lt;->India ticket booked on Expedia with an Air France ticket. We obviously can't fly this and some legs have already been cancelled anyway. We like a full refund, not airline credit.

Question: What's the best strategy to approach this? We shouldn't really call Expedia until 72-hours before departure, Air France says ""call your travel agent"" and I'm worried that Expedia will simply say ""airline is offering credit: take it or leave it. EU261 is not our problem"". Does anyone have some experience with Air France cancellations recently?
","i would say that at least air france is being fairly up front in light of the  probable  fact that their cash flow does not suffice for the refunds that they are obliged to provide. if they had not come up with this voucher policy and instead decided to acknowledge their obligations up front, they would probably nonetheless drag their feet a year or more before actually giving you the money.  that said, the regulation does in fact specify reimbursement within seven days. so you could pursue them if you want to. short of hiring a lawyer, the regulation provides that you can seek enforcement through the national enforcement body designated under article 16 1 . a list of such bodies is found on the website of the european commission.

"In the US Senate on Sunday, March 22nd, passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was blocked in a 47-47 vote. The vote was generally along party lines, with one exception: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell voted against the cloture measure alongside the Democrats, despite arguing forcefully for the passage of the bill. I've noticed this with other bills and with Harry Reid before McConnell, so it's not just this bill – it seems like a more common pattern.

Why would the Senate Majority leader vote against cloture on a bill that they support? Is it a procedural issue?
","while looking for more examples of this process, i stumbled upon the answer.   why is harry reid always voting against his own plans     forty u.s. senators voted to block a final vote on chuck hagel is nomination to be defense secretary. of those, 39 were republicans opposed to the nomination, at least for the moment. the other was harry reid. it was not that reid opposed hagel -- far from it. ...    so what gives  in articles like the one i wrote on the hagel filibuster, the short explanation we give is that reid voted no  for procedural reasons  or because a no vote  allows him to bring another cloture vote in the future.  ...    as sarah binder, a senate rules expert at george washington university, told me, it is not that the majority leader has to vote no. it is that somebody on the winning side of the cloture vote -- in this case, the side voting against cloture -- has to file a  motion to reconsider  if the matter is to be taken up again.  i suppose the broader parliamentary principle here is that it would be somewhat unfair to give someone on the losing side of a question a second bite at the apple,  binder explains. so the rules provide for senators whose opinion has changed to motion for another vote, whereas those whose opinion stays the same do not get to keep filing to reconsider.    reid, and other majority leaders before him, have developed a clever workaround: just change your vote at the last minute if it looks as though you are going to lose, then move to reconsider. in theory, any supporter of the bill or nomination in question could do the same, but traditionally it is been the majority leader.   senate rules say that after a failed cloture vote  ie. the bill did not get the 60 votes needed to overrule a filibuster , a  motion to reconsider   that is, a second attempt at cloture  can only be called by a member of the winning side of the vote.

"Recently I caught a cold in presumably an amazingly short period of time (~6h). From prior infections I had the experience to have 24 to 48 hours ""left"" being a bit ill, before being forced to stay in bed. Observing my disease I asked myself what went different this time. In general I don't get ill too easy.


Morning: got to work as usual feeling reasonably well
12pm: ate some sushi bought from a supermarket
~3 pm: ate a bowl of strawberries - unwashed
6pm: already felt a scratchy throat
9pm: having a Skype call planning some event, starting to have a headache 
11pm: falling to bed really exhausted
I did not have contact with
visibly ill people during that day.


My theory now is, that the unwashed strawberries carried the pathogen. Here are some thoughts that might support this:


Since I got hit so fast I'm assuming being exposed to a high number of bacteria.
The pathogens where possibly passed by an ill harvester.
Strawberries being sweet, moist and un-chilled seem to be the perfect fertile ground for reproduction.
The incubation period of colds is usually a lot longer (2-5 days). Does a higher number of bacteria result in a shorter incubation period?
Washing the strawberries would have helped. The bacteria was just on the surface area, since the vessels of the strawberries of course where not alive anymore.

"I had a ski trip planned from 14th March - 21st March. 
I arrived in the French ski resort at 15:00 on 14th March and by 23:00 the French government went into lock down and ordered all non-essential businesses to close immediately - including ski resorts. 

Fearing being stuck in the resort, the next morning I changed my return flight from 21st March to 16th March and had to pay extra fees.

I tried to contact my insurance company but they did not answer. I was also in a rush as my accommodation has ordered me to leave, but I do not have proof of this in writing unfortunately.

I am now trying to claim these extra fees back from my insurance company but they are stating that because the FCO (UK Govt) did not announce non essential travel until the 17th March I have no claim. 

The exact wording in my travel policy for curtailment is:


  If you have to curtail your trip as a result of the Travel Advice Unit of the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office
  (FCO), the World Health Organisation (WHO) or similar body recommending evacuation from the country or
  specific area in which you are travelling, providing the directive came into force after you purchased this
  insurance and after you have left your Country of Residence to commence the trip (whichever is the later).


And the reply from my insurance company was:


  Unfortunately, from the information you provided, it would appear as shown above, the reason you abandoned your trip is not included in the specified incidents for which cover is provided under the policy. 
  You paid the fee to amend your flight on the 15th of March, however, the FCO advice to travel to/from France came into force on the 17th of March. We are therefore unable to consider your claim further.


This is really cheeky of them and they clearly don't want to pay out. I need some advice on the fact that I was already abroad at the time of this announcement - the host country has ordered everything to close and therefore my trip will be cut short. 

What points can I argue that my policy is in fact valid and I am due a refund?
Thanks
","the wording states    ...or similar body recommending evacuation from the country    so although the fco might not have issued advice until later, the fact that the french government ordered all resorts closed should be sufficient.  so you need to find this advice from french government sources online, write back to your insurance company and be polite but firm and point this out to them. keep your letter short and to the point and state that you had no choice and the country was being locked down and all non-residents ordered to leave. therefore, according to the t amp cs of your policy you expect the claim to be honoured and paid in full asap.  also point them to this statement from the financial conduct authority: http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/insurance-and-coronavirus-our-expectations  and this: http://www.choose.co.uk/news/2020/covid-19-insurance-policy-advice-government/  state that you are disappointed with their behaviour and are considering complaining to the insurance ombudsman. and will pursue the claim further if they do not pay.  if they still refuse, then your only option is to complain to the ombudsman and/or pursue them in the small claims court.

What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. some people become infected but do not develop any symptoms and do not feel unwell. most people  about 80   recover from the disease without needing special treatment. around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.",22

"I am a Master's student in epidemiology. It's an insane time in our field right now. Of course, I find what's going on fascinating (that's why I am in this field), but extremely stressful as well. 

I have 2 advisors. My primary advisor is not working on COVID-19 related stuff. So, although she's really busy trying to re-plan all of her classes to be remote and just reorganize everything, she is not responding directly to the outbreak. My co-advisor, however, is on the response team for the outbreak in my country. Basically, she is working with the government to create models to predict the trajectory of the disease. I had a meeting with her 1.5 weeks ago and she said basically all she has on her mind is COVID-19. That was before the world went into quarantine so I imagine things have become even busier for her. 

My primary advisor sent me an email today talking about how to move forward and in the email she mentioned that it does depend on how busy my co-advisor is (but also assured me we would figure this all out). 

Unfortunately, the project I am working on now is a modelling project and my primary advisor isn't a modeller, so it's my co-advisor that needs to move the project forward. I still have other things to do for my thesis, but I am almost done those other things and I am just in the editing stages. I have a lot more to do on my modelling project, but my co-advisor is extremely busy right now. I am finished what she asked me to do a couple of weeks ago and want to send it to her.

Sorry for the long post explaining my situation. My question is, should I send her the things the I have finished or would that be a bit tone-deaf? What should I even say in the email? I don't want to come off as not caring about the biggest health crisis in at least a decade while asking her to review something that's not even related to COVID-19. How should I even frame the email or should I hold off from sending her things for a few weeks? 

If it makes a difference, although I do have an office, I can do 100% of my work remotely (and do usually work from home at least 3 days a week). 
","as someone who is been out of academia for a while, i would like to offer a different perspective. yes, occupying your co-advisor is attention when the roof is on fire is tone-deaf. however: you have acquired skills that are obviously in high demand these days, and are thrown into a  hopefully  once-in-a lifetime situation to apply these skills. especially since you are not on a strict deadline with your thesis, there are now more important things than finishing the thesis at the scheduled time. see this as an opportunity, not an obstacle.  check if this is okay with your primary advisor, then send a mail to your co-advisor saying that you would be glad to put your thesis on ice and help her with her covid work if she has anything you could be of help with. if you are a capable student, she probably will.   then, when things have calmed down, reevaluate the situation, see what you have learned in the meantime, and continue from there.

"Some news reports suggested Czech Republic stopped issuing visa to Chinese citizens/nationals and closed visa centres in China after the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.

The latter is of course understandable. But are all Chinese nationals, regardless of travel history/place of residence, affected by this?

","from what i can find of official information, the czech republic has suspended the processing of visa applications and issuance of visa at the embassy in beijing and the consulates in china  shanghai, chengdu  and hong kong. it is worth to notice that this restriction affects also non-chinese residents of china, who are now also not able to apply for a visa.  some media have indeed reported that the visa ban applies to all chinese citizens, but there is no official information supporting that and i believe these reports to be mistakes. it seems very well possible for chinese citizens who are resident outside china to get a czech visa from the consulates at their place of residence and there seem to be no ban for residents of china to enter the czech republic if they are already in posession of a visa.  unless the czech republic is the main destination in the schengen area, it should also still be possible for chinese residents to obtain a schengen visa from other consulates and then use that visa for travel to the czech republic. it will probably have little impact on actual travel patterns for a single schengen country to impose restrictions as have been done here.

Can antiretrovirals be used to treat COVID-19?,"several studies have suggested that patients infected with the virus causing covid-19, and the related coronavirus infections  sars-cov and mers-cov  had good clinical outcomes, with almost all cases recovering fully. in some cases, patients were given an antiretroviral drug: lopinavir boosted with ritonavir  lpv/r . these studies were mostly carried out in hiv-negative individuals.it is important to note that these studies using lpv/r had important limitations. the studies were small, timing, duration and dosing for treatment were varied and most patients received co-interventions/co-treatments which may have contributed to the reported outcomes. while the evidence of benefit of using antiretrovirals to treat coronavirus infections is of very low certainty, serious side effects were rare. among people living with hiv, the routine use of lpv/r as treatment for hiv is associated with several side effects of moderate severity. however, as the duration of treatment in patients with coronavirus infections was generally limited to a few weeks, these occurrences can be expected to be low or less than that reported from routine use.",8
Should I wear a face mask?,"not unless you are the one who is sick.  the cdc does not currently recommend any healthy person wear a mask and doctors warn fiddling with putting on and taking off a mask could backfire by exposing your hands to your face.   surgical masks fit rather loosely around the face and are not constructed, nor thick enough, to prevent infection,  schaffner said.  while they could have a modest benefit, any protection they provide is likely more psychological than scientific. n-95 masks, which hospitals use, are expensive and are not easy to wear, meaning they are not a practical option for everyday use. as health officials have noted, masks should be reserved for the health care workers, not the general public.  in recent weeks, n-95 masks have grown so scarce that the white house is asking americans who have them, as well as construction companies, to donate them to hospitals, so that health care workers are not forced to treat covid-19 patients without a mask, which puts them at risk for contracting the virus themselves.   the other thing a mask can do is give you a false sense of security, and that is not helpful,  said dr. michael merson, a visiting professor at nyu is school of global public health and a professor at duke university. masks work better at preventing people who are coughing and sneezing from spreading respiratory droplets and infecting others, but  those people who are sick should probably be at home anyway.

"In the middle of the Covid-19 lockdown, at least in France and in Italy newsagents are in the list of first-necessity stores that remain open. ""To go buy a newspaper"" is a legitimate reason to leave one's house.

I wonder about the motivations of this decision: buying a newspaper is not essential by any definition of the term. Television, radio and internet are largely sufficient to cover the need for information of the general population.

Is there a reasonable political explanation for this? At first sight, it seems that the only one is the ties and the balance of power between politicians and news outlets / medias.
","at least in italy, this appears to be in part a response to pressure from newspapers and their readers. on march 11th, the director of la repubblica newspaper carlo verdelli published  in italian  an article asking for newsagents to be included in the list of essential services, saying that  the list is missing a service that is more fundamental   now than ever before, that of information . he went on to state that  if  newsagents  were not included in the list, it would cause irreparable damage, not only for newspapers, but most importantly for the citizenry.   my translation   this is an important point, as a study undertaken by the pew research center in 2017 found that while tv and online media dominate, 31  of italians and 23  of french adults get their news from print media at least daily. this group is likely to be composed of older citizens who will be most affected if they contract the virus, and although this puts them at more risk if they leave their houses to buy a newspaper, it is of higher importance to keep at-risk groups informed.   in addition, another pew research center study found that newspapers were especially important for coverage of local news that would not otherwise be reported in alternative media - although the study was limited to the us, this is another potential factor that could have influenced the decision.  it seems that france and italy have decided that informing the populace is especially important in this time of crisis, and that this outweighs the threat public health and the potential spread of disease that the inclusion of newsagents as an essential service poses.

"There has been a lot of talk about online teaching in relation to covid-19 and campus shutdowns.

This question isn't about that though: my question is about what ways online examinations should be treated in counterpoint to written examinations. 

I'm going to be transferring my course's written examination into an online environment. This examination involved 2 hours of students, with a pen and paper, answering questions both short and long in a typical examination environemnt.

An online exam however cannot be policed. Demanding it be anything other than open book is unrealistic. What methods can be deployed such that it is a genuine test of students' knowledge and capabilities?
","first, a two hour time limit might be difficult to enforce or to guarantee, especially if it uses a real-time clock. at some level of scale you may start to find that some students did not get the exam paper or were unable to return it by the deadline. so, i would start by rethinking if a time limit of less than a day is really essential to your exam.   second, you can pre-vet any questions you ask by doing searching yourself online for possible answers and responses. reject questions that have too much online presence, or be prepared for getting that back as answers. presumably the test is not about effective online searches.   third, give up the idea of asking students for facts. that is obvious, i would think, as facts are cheap. but even facts requiring computation, such as in mathematics or statistics can be generated with tools such as matlab or mathematica.   the best sort of questions, i think, are those that require either or both of interpretation and insight. questions about the why of things rather than the what and how are much better. however, these are the hardest to create, the hardest to answer, and are likely to have the widest variation in quality from students. to grade them might require quite a lot of interpretation: does this student show any insight at all into the subject  pass-fail grading can be considered. repeat attempts can be considered.   as an alternative to an exam, you can consider individual portfolio development by students. students write or otherwise create some artifacts according to some criteria. plagiarism concerns come in to play here, of course.   i will note that honor codes can help to a certain extent, though provide no guarantees. and honor codes created in the moment are probably less effective than those of long standing.

"The COVID-19 outbreak has been dominating the news recently, with loads of headlines and efforts being made to stop it from spreading.

Why this disease? It's not one of the most lethal ones, or one of the deadliest. Compare:


COVID-19 - infected 24,478; deaths 492
Malaria - infected 228 million; deaths 405,000 (2018 data)
Tuberculosis - infected 25% of world population, i.e. ~2 billion; deaths 1.6 million (2017 data)
HIV/AIDS - infected 37.9 million; 1.7 million new cases a year; deaths 770,000 (2018 data)


Compared to malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, the COVID-19 outbreak is pretty much a rounding error.

In terms of lethality, COVID-19 has a case fatality rate of 1.4-6.5%. This is still well below the lethality of tuberculosis (43%) and HIV/AIDS (80-90% after 5 years if untreated), although it is more lethal than malaria (~0.3%)

It seems like, objectively, COVID-19 is a very small fish in the pond of infectious diseases. It's not like the three diseases above are unique either; there're lots more diseases that affect &amp; kill more people than nCoV (e.g. measles, leishmaniosis). Yet, right now, when people die of COVID-19 they make the news, while thousands of people die of the other three diseases every day without getting a mention. Further, COVID-19 is apparently attracting lots of research efforts to treat it. Why is it being prioritized over other infectious diseases?

I'm looking for objective answers as to why COVID-19 matters so much.
","the short answer to this question is that 2019-ncov is new. all the other diseases you mentioned are known quantities: epidemiologists have a good idea how they behave, how they spread, what is likely to happen in a variety of different scenarios, etc. but this disease represents a new mutation that behaves differently from other coronaviruses. it is far more transmissible than other coronaviruses, and worse, seems to be transmissible through casual contact: not intimate contact, blood or fluid exposure, not through an intermediary vector like a tick or flea. currently the death toll is low, but researchers simply do not have enough data to know whether that trend will continue.   remember, the death rate of influenza is lower than that of this coronavirus. the 1958 and 1967 influenza pandemics had death rates of about 0.1 , and the 1918 pandemic had a death rate of about 2.5  . but those pandemics killed millions because they were so transmissible they infected hundreds of millions. if the coronavirus follows that pattern and turns pandemic, we might expect to see any city of a million or so people suffer 20,000 to 30,000 deaths over the course of a couple of months  say 400-500 per day , which is a huge number of people dying by any calculus. discretion is definitely the better part of valor, here. ",66
What is being given to treat the coronavirus once you’ve become infected?,"there is no vaccine for the new virus and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat covid-19, so treatment consists of supportive care to help relieve symptoms and, for severe cases, care to support vital organ functions, the cdc says.    about 80  of people recover from the disease without needing special treatment, according to the who. for most patients, that means drinking plenty of fluids and resting, just as you would for the cold or flu.",39

"The COVID-19 virus causes respiratory illnesses. The virus does so by changing the generic code of our cell.

If a virus can cause a change in our body, like respiratory illness, can the same techniques in a controlled manner be used in a constructive manner, for example treating cancer.

Simply if I ask, can we create a virus like a thing to work for good in our body, just like nuclear fusion used for bombs and electricity.
","i think the claim about viruses always being destructive is not a good starting assumption for a question. for several reasons:   in the sense that op is probably considering, it is not true. counterexample, see below  and there are also other uses we put viruses to . in a wider sense, life is always destructive in that a living organism uses energy, substances, and space that otherwise could be used by another living organism. while we could debate whether viruses are alive or not, they certainly share these points. so a bacteriophage  see below  may be destructive to the bacterium it infects. but that bacterium dying means the  neighbor strain  that is resistant against this phage is thriving. so one organism is destruction eases the life of other organisms. in that sense, i consider the claim of desctructivity with  so, what         can we create a virus like a thing to work for good in our body   have a look at bacteriophages and phage therapy. bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria, and there has been research about using them against bacterial infections about 100 years ago, in parallel to the development of antibiotics.   besides political/language difficulties  bacteriophage research was strong in the soviet union, and in consquence lots of the research publications are in russian  back then antibiotics turned out to be easier and cheaper in practice  this may change with increasing antibiotic resistances, though .  antibiotics are produced by chemical synthesis or isolation from plant/fungi. they are chemical substances, so once we have studies that show that the stuff works as intended, product testing  only  needs to show that the correct modification of the correct substances is there in the correct concentration.   but the viruses are more-or-less alive, and in any case they evolve. so chemical substance testing is not sufficient, for each batch the biological activity must be checked and proved anew. this means a lot of expensive work for each batch of the virus. also, the bacteriophages are pretty much the opposite of a broad-spectrum antibiotic: they are not only species specific but also strain specfic  i do not know whether that is the case always, often, or sufficiently often to hinder practical application .

"This Science Daily article states that steroids could do more harm than good in treating coronavirus (COVID-19), referring to this The Lancet article. 


  Understanding the evidence for harm or benefit from corticosteroids in
  2019-nCoV is of immediate clinical importance.


It's unclear to me how exactly the use of corticosteroids (which is a common treatments for Asthma patients) can do harm other than the vague explanation of ""steroids also impair the immune system's ability to fight viruses"". 

How exactly does the use of steroids harm the body in case of fighting a virus such as SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) that causes COVID-19?
","one of the primary purposes of corticosteroids is to suppress immune activity and inflammation: that is exactly why they are used in asthma.  of course the immune system has an actual job besides causing nuisance inflammation: fighting infection.  for some infections, the harm to the infected person caused by the immune reaction itself is worse than that of the pathogen itself, so steroids can help prevent damage or ease symptoms while the immune system continues to mount a response, without being hyperactive.  for others, immune suppression may be detrimental.   corticosteroids mediate the immune response by suppressing a variety of cytokines and increasing others, which influences activity circulating numbers of different immune cell populations. cortisol binds the glucocorticoid receptor, causing numerous changes in gene expression, many of which are associated with the immune system. from wikipedia:     cortisol  inhibits production of interleukin  il -12, interferon  ifn -gamma, ifn-alpha, and tumor-necrosis-factor  tnf -alpha by antigen-presenting cells  apcs  and t helper  th 1 cells, but upregulates il-4, il-10, and il-13 by th2 cells. this results in a shift toward a th2 immune response rather than general immunosuppression. the activation of the stress system  and resulting increase in cortisol and th2 shift  seen during an infection is believed to be a protective mechanism which prevents an over-activation of the inflammatory response.   in other words, corticosteroids work by by suppressing the generalized killing/cleanup part of the immune system mediated by macrophages and cd8  cells, while preserving the b-cell part of the immune system that produces specific antibodies and the neutrophils that phagocytose antibody- and complement-bound pathogens.  immune reactions are incredibly complex, so some of these basics may be violated in certain circumstances  including prolonged rather than acute dosing , and i have left out a lot of the other related immune cells. see references below  and the wikipedia pages linked above  for more:    cupps, t. r.,  amp  fauci, a. s.  1982 . corticosteroid-mediated immunoregulation in man. immunological reviews, 65 1 , 133-155.  mcgee, s.,  amp  hirschmann, j.  2008 . use of corticosteroids in treating infectious diseases. archives of internal medicine, 168 10 , 1034-1046.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak - WHO



On 2020.01.30, the Director-General of Emergency Committee convened by the WHO declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV (2019 Novel Coronavirus) constitutes a PHEIC (Public Health Emergency of International Concern).

Actions by country/region:

Hong Kong declares coronavirus emergency. (2020.01.25)

Italy declares state of emergency over coronavirus. (2020.01.31)

U.S.A declared a public health emergency (PHE). (2020.01.31)

South Korea raised threat alert to the highest level. (2020.02.23)

Some provinces of China lower emergency response as epidemic slows. (2020.02.26)

My question:

What are the consequences of PHEIC, to China and to other countries?


","tl dr: there are not any tangible consequences, unless china or other countries decide to take any.    the world health organization is an agency of the united nations. but it does not have any legislative powers. its activities are limited to spending its budget on funding health-related research, spreading health information and funding healthcare projects which operate within the legal framework of the countries they operate in.   it might advise governments to take actions, like for example fund healthcare measures, discourage/promote products depending on their health impact, enact quarantines or discourage/promote certain medical procedures. but it does not have the authority to enforce any of those measures themselves.  now what exactly does it mean that the who declares a public health emergency of international concern  it is basically just a declaration, stating that the who believes that this is a problem people should take seriously. the who has done that 5 times before, each time in case of a global outbreak of an acute infectious disease:   2009  swine flu  2014  polio  2014  ebola  2016  zika  2019  kivu ebola   ",27
"A part of this answer got me wondering if another state can request compensations over the huge economical cost of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics:


  (..) the region (HK, Singapore, SK?, China) was hit much harder during the 2003 SARS epidemic so spent more time getting prepared.
  
  (..) it has long been the expectation that the next epidemic would come out of China, both due to population density and proximity to livestock/wild animals, so those countries could expect another ""gift"" from their Chinese neighbors.


Theoretically it can be argued that China could have tackle ""the proximity to livestock/wild animals"" to avoid another pandemic. 

Is it possible for a country to ask for compensation over a pandemic started in another country. Or a pandemic is assimilated to a naturally occurring event regardless of context?

Question: Is it possible for a country to ask for compensation over damage done by SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that most likely started in China?
","first, let is address the biological point. china is not aresponsible  for this novel coronavirus or the pandemic it is generating. viruses are constantly mutating, and all it takes to begin an epidemic is for one person to encounter one animal that has a mutated strain of a virus, a strain which can jump species and start transmitting itself human to human. humans are social creatures  they will have social contact and pass the strain on to others. of course, being in a densely packed region with exposure to livestock increases the odds of that kind of encounter and maximizes the rate of transmission -- lots of people nearby to infect, so the disease does not have to work its way outward -- but that is a condition of poverty as much as anything else. people living on marginal incomes will pack together and bring their livestock with them, because they cannot afford the luxuries of personal space or shipped-in food.  and frankly, while poverty exacerbates diseases, it does not create them. the next pandemic could just as easily start because some well-to-do american on his country estate gets shat on by an infected bird. novel infections are a natural phenomenon. we are not immune to the workings of nature  despite our pretensions  so epidemics will happen on a rare but regular basis. blaming a particular region for a pandemic is like blaming your neighbor because you got crabgrass in your lawn. crabgrass does not know, or care, whose lawn it is.  this  neighbor  example is a good analogy for the problem this question faces. currently, all states are treated as sovereign, like a neighborhood of houses in which each homeowner has absolute say over what he gets to do with his house and yard. there is no overarching governance: no courts, no police, no administrators, no higher authority to appeal to, to force a neighbor to do this or that on his property. the un is like a town hall in which people come together to argue and make resolutions, but it has no real teeth except as individual sovereigns agree to abide by its decisions. this leaves only a few options on the table:   shrug and ignore what other sovereign homeowners do on their own turf, implicitly accepting the bad things that might float over the fence into one is own yard  i.e., the status quo . try to create agreements that commit all parties to certain kinds of behavior  i.e. pacts and treaties : a slow and difficult process to begin with, and one that any sovereign can back out of at any convenient-for-them time. restrict the ability of particular sovereign homeowners to interact with the community, in the hopes that deprivation will force them into compliance  i.e., sanctions, embargoes, etc. . create independent, unaligned groups that ask permission to enter another is sovereign territory to solve particular problems before they spread  i.e, ngo is and such . note that sovereign homeowners are under no obligation to allow such groups access, and can interfere with such groups  work in any way they desire. force your way onto another is sovereign territory to solve the problem against that sovereign is will  i.e., war .   so long as we maintain the decrepit ideal of sovereign nations, there is not much we can do to prevent the spread of a disease through a nation and across its borders. there is nothing at all we can do to prevent the birth of a novel disease. and unless we are willing to address underlying social issues like poverty and overpopulation, we are as much to blame as anyone else for pandemics of this sort, so there is no point in trying to collect  compensation  for some imagined wrongdoing we project onto others.

Why worry about coronavirus when the flu kills many more people?,"the novel coronavirus is dangerous for several reasons, even if the number of deaths have not matched that of the flu.  the first us case of coronavirus was reported in january, and the first us death from coronavirus was reported in late february. by april 9, the us had more than 456,800 cases of coronavirus, and more than 16,000 people have died.  since this flu season started october 1, more than 24,000 americans have died from the flu, according to cdc estimates. nationwide, the flu has infected at least 39 million people between october and late march.   but here are key differences when comparing the flu vs. coronavirus:     the cdc estimates for the flu go back to october 2019. but the first us case of coronavirus did not emerge until several months later.  coronavirus is twice as contagious as the flu. research indicates a person with the flu infects an average of 1.28 other people, cnn chief medical correspondent dr. sanjay gupta said. but with coronavirus,  it is likely between 2 and 3  other people.  coronavirus infections have a  very high mortality rate - one in six - among people who are over 80 and people with underlying chronic disease,  epidemiologist dr. abdul el-sayed said.   people with coronavirus might not get symptoms for 14 days, and some get no symptoms at all. but during that time, they are still contagious and can infect others unknowingly.   a vaccine is available for the flu, but no vaccine is available for coronavirus. experts say the number of flu deaths could be drastically reduced if more people got their flu shots. but about half of americans do not get vaccinated, including most children who die from the flu.",34

[...] So now the term ""Wuhan Virus"", which up until a month ago was a professional term, is full-out racist.


How much of the US media referred to COVID-19 as the ""Wuhan virus"" before it received an official WHO designation on February 11th? Basically, was this ""Wuhan virus"" (term) a common occurrence in the US media in Feb and Jan this year?
","max rissuto from dfrlab has analysed this in an article published on march 17th which tests the media bias claims made by republican politicians including gop house leader kevin mccarthy, who tweeted that  democrats are trying to score political points by calling republicans racist  and that the  media called it  chinese coronavirus  for weeks . while mccarthy uses the term  chinese coronavirus , rissuto is analysis also includes the term  wuhan virus . it should be noted however that this analysis was performed on all english language publications, not just us-targeted media, and has only collected data up until march 10th.  dfrlab conducted a series of queries using a media monitoring tool to test the claim that media organizations are acting hypocritically in this way, gathering information about how geographic adjectives were used by the media to describe the disease before the official name of  covid-19  was applied by the who. this data is summarized in the chart below.    source:  maxbrizzuto/dfrlab   from this data, we can see that the terms  wuhan virus   amp   wuhan coronavirus  both had widespread use in english language media from the end of january up until the who named the disease on february 11th. the usage was comparable to the usage of the terms  china virus , and less commonly,  chinese coronavirus . after this date, we see the usage fall away dramatically, albeit not entirely, up until the recent debacle surrounding the use of geographic adjectives by various us and international politicians. this could also be due to the fact that as the virus spread throughout china, publications that would have used  wuhan virus  found  china virus  to be more accurate.  in conclusion then, while a significant proportion of articles used the term  wuhan virus  prior to naming conventions for the disease being established, after this point most media outlets switched to using the official terminology. the usage of the term has seen a resurgence in the media recently due in part to publications reporting on some politician is continued use of this terminology.

"Presuming that we were able to find a person who was never exposed to any of the human seasonal coronaviruses (part of the viruses that cause the common cold), would the virus be just as deadly for that person as the SARS-CoV-2 currently circulating around the world? Or is SARS-CoV-2  uniquely dangerous?
","the seasonal coronaviruses attach exclusively to cells with a ciliated epithelium.     coronaviruses invade the respiratory tract via the nose. after an incubation period of about 3 days, they cause the symptoms of a common cold, including nasal obstruction, sneezing, runny nose, and occasionally cough  figs. 60-1 and 60-2 . the disease resolves in a few days, during which virus is shed in nasal secretions. there is some evidence that the respiratory coronaviruses can cause disease of the lower airways but it is unlikely that this is due to direct invasion. other manifestations of disease such as multiple sclerosis have been attributed to these viruses but the evidence is not clear-cut.    studies in both organ cultures and human volunteers show that coronaviruses are extremely fastidious and grow only in differentiated respiratory epithelial cells. infected cells become vacuolated, show damaged cilia, and may form syncytia. cell damage triggers the production of inflammatory mediators, which increase nasal secretion and cause local inflammation and swelling. these responses in turn stimulate sneezing, obstruct the airway, and raise the temperature of the mucosa.   so, the mechanism of infection is such that they only attack the upper airways.  the sars-cov-2 is totally different. it attaches to the ace2 surface receptor which is found deep in aleolar pneumocytes. their damage causes loss of surfactant in the alveloi, the collapse of these air cells that perform oxygen exchange and subsequently ards.  so, seasonal coronaviruses give you a runny nose but do not kill. sars-cov-2 collapses your air cells so you do not have any oxygen.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/nbk7782/ ",17
"We are witnessing the financial and personal repercussions of the spread of the corona virus that originated in Wuhan. It seems that the virus started spreading possibly as early as mid-November with the Chinese government trying to hide/downplay/minimize the issue at hand. Given the Chinese government failure to:


Prevent the sale of raw animal meat and enforce the necessary sanitary measures to avoid human contact with raw meat.
Allowing farming and selling of wild animals, which was than corrected later by issuing a law banning such sales, thus admitting the problem.
Properly contain the spread in Wuhan by acknowledging the alarm calls of the local doctors and first signs that an unknown strain of corona virus was circulating.


Is it possible for governments and private companies, I imagine only the most powerful ones, to sue the Chinese government to seek financial compensation for the damages occurred worlwide?

I imagine that if a private company would accidentally leak a virus outside a lab, such company would be liable for all damages, why is a government not liable for any damage in this case? Can, theoretically, Chinese or citizens from other countries sue the Chinese government for the loss of loved ones?
","the main problem is that there is no court with authority to hear this case outside of china. it may be futile to sue in us courts, since china will not enforce us judgments. you can sue a chinese company in chinese court, under their civil procedure law, but this pertains to contract breach. the question is whether there is any law under which the government of china can be sued for negligence - it is unlikely that that is possible  perhaps there is an expert in chinese law here who can address that issue .  this lawsuit is filed in us courts. it is based on the foreign sovereign immunities act. supposing that this lawsuit is successful in us courts, then the question is what enforcement actions are possible. since the defendants are various governments and government agencies in china, execution of the judgment would have to be against those defendants - you can not seize the assets of every person with some connection to china. but given the nature of the chinese government, it is possible that us courts could find that the assets of chinese companies are effectively government assets.  the short answer is, in fact a lawsuit has been filed, and i expect more. i also do not expect them to succeed in the long run.

"Currently farmers in Western countries are warning governments that without foreign workers their fields will be impossible to harvest:


  “We are in need of a lot of foreign workers,” Eystein Ruud, a greenhouse farm owner and chairman of the Norwegian Horticultural Association, told The Globe and Mail. “If we cannot get these workers in the coming weeks, our farmers won’t risk putting a lot of plants in the soil. That may affect the food supply.”


At the same time Western nations are about to face unprecedented levels of unemployment due to the COVID-related shutdowns. On the face of it, this seems like a perfect match - people who lost their jobs could now work their local fields, earning a salary and supplying much needed food for the nation. So why is this considered a problem, rather than a blessing in disguise? Shouldn't governments be happy they have job openings for the unemployed?

I do understand that working the fields is difficult and only young people could do it, but currently a lot of young people lack a job too, so that looks like a manageable problem.
","i think these countries are in fact approaching this as a problem that has an obvious solution, as you suggest. the issue lies, however, with convincing their populace to work these seasonal jobs, and the inherent nature of seasonal agricultural work.  firstly, the levels of unemployment are not necessarily going to be as bad as you might think, at least in some countries. many western countries, including norway, which you mention, and later, the uk, have implemented schemes which will allow companies to keep employees who have been furloughed due to the crisis on the payroll by covering a large portion of their wages. these schemes do not stop claimants from taking another job, at least in the uk is case, but potentially reduce the need for them to do so.  secondly, the nature of this work means that for this to be a long-term job choice, workers need to be flexible and able to travel around the country. the bbc points out that     one reason overseas workers are recruited for these picking roles is  that farmers require temporary, flexible workers who will move around  the country following the crops.  it is often difficult for local people to fill these roles as they are  extremely busy for a short space of time - for example, two months to  pick apples - with no work for the rest of the year.   so while it might be easy to find workers in one area of the country, it is currently infeasible given the covid-19 crisis for workers to travel around the country as previously. therefore, a much larger number of local workers need to be found in order to meet with local demand, rather than smaller groups of seasonal workers meeting the demand nationally.  additionally, western europeans are unused to this sort of work. according to the independent:    it is fair to say that british workers have turned their noses up at  seasonal farm work in recent years, perhaps partly due to the  availability of other, more secure jobs in more comfortable  surroundings.     it is hard work and the eastern europeans are experienced at what they  do,  says oliver shooter, owner of ae lenton, which runs a group of  farms between skegness and boston in lincolnshire, the centre of  england is vegetable production.     it is not rocket science but it is quite a skilled job that these guys  do,  he says. a top picker needs to know and apply supermarkets   exacting standards for exactly how fruit and veg must look, as well as  how to cut it and pack it. for that they will earn ps12 an hour if  they are good. many farms also provide free or subsidised  accommodation.   the seasonal workers that farms usually rely on, that know their trade and are experienced are unable to be used, so farmers are again being forced to engage a larger workforce than normal, in order to achieve a similar standard of work. this will, of course, entail higher costs, a longer training period, and presumably, a lower yield as mistakes are made.  governments are trying to deal with this problem by pushing the solution you suggest - the independent reports again:    so acute is the need that the government is reportedly readying its  own  pick for britain  campaign taking inspiration from the land army  that tilled the fields during the second world war.   in norway, the government has introduced a scheme which will encourage employees laid off by their employer to work in agricultural roles:    new legislation means that if a worker is laid off and takes up an  agricultural role, he or she will be able to earn both a salary from  the farmer as well as half his or her unemployment benefit.   it is not so much that the solution to the problem is not obvious, it is that due to a combination of the nature of seasonal agricultural work, and the complications introduced by the current crisis, the problem is harder to solve than at first glance.

"One question we often get on this site in one form or the other is: Is my paper under review (or similar) for too long and if yes, how should I react? Now, suppose I have gone through all the steps to answer this question in a normal situation: I have procured statistics of the journal’s handling or peer-review times, added a fair margin for individual variability, etc. My question is: How should I modify these in lights of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis? I do not want to bother editors more than appropriate.

The obvious thoughts are:


Some reviewers and editors are busy with challenges arising due to the crisis, e.g., due to having to switch to online teaching, having no childcare, etc.
On the other hand, some reviewers and editors now have more time available due to conferences being cancelled, not being able to access their labs, and similar.
Some fields are obviously directly affected by the crisis, in particular medicine, virology, and epidemiology. I am not considering those.


I am only interested in answers that go beyond such obvious thoughts, for example being based on experience as an editor.
The ideal are answers based on statistics, but those likely do not exist yet (but will be welcome when they eventually will).
","i am an associate editor for two journals, and although the situation is fairly new, i expect to have no substantive change in the time for me to handle papers.  the reasons for this are:   pretty much everything is handled purely electronically anyway, so there is no physical interaction to be disrupted. reviewing is typically a sparse activity by people who are mostly always overloaded anyway, and it is always fairly low triage for people. as such, i do not anticipate the availability of reviewers to particularly change: if people have more time, they will fill it with things more important to them  if people have less time, i will just have to ask a few more to find a full reviewer set. the time to review is typically dominated by the time that a manuscript ages quietly on the reviewer is desk before the review deadline arrives --- actually carrying out a review often does not take all that much time, by comparison. the number of weeks we give our reviewers is not going to change, so that dominating time will not either. because of the preceding factors, there is already a lot of stochasticity in time to review. even if it does go up a bit, i doubt it will be readily detectable against the background of stochasticity.

Coronavirus has mutated at least once


  The novel coronavirus that has infected thousands of people across the
  world may have mutated at least once — meaning there may be two
  different types of the virus causing illnesses, a new study conducted
  by Chinese scientists suggests.
  
  Scientists with Peking University’s School of Life Sciences and the
  Institut Pasteur of Shanghai in a preliminary study found that one
  strain — type “L” —  of the virus was more aggressive and accounted
  for about 70 percent of the strains analyzed. The second — type “S” —
  was less aggressive and accounted for about 30 percent of analyzed
  strains.


But also several webpages theorized the virus has mutated before passing from animals to humans. 

This page What we know about the Wuhan virus says


  This virus belongs to a family of viruses known as coronaviruses.
  Named for the crown-like spikes on their surfaces, they infect mostly
  bats, pigs and small mammals. But they mutate easily and can jump from
  animals to humans


and


  Where did the new coronavirus come from? The new virus likely came
  originally from bats, scientists say. It isn’t known exactly where or
  how it jumped to humans, though. Viruses from bats often infect
  another mammal first and then mutate to become more transmissible to
  humans.


though


  Coronaviruses can also jump directly to humans, without mutating or

Is something more known about this? Is it possible the virus has mutated twice in a period of time of months?
","this question makes a number of incorrect assumptions and i do not have time to correct them. the short answer is that the virus has mutated probably hundreds of times since it entered humans in late 2019.   the lower figure on the nextstrain.org ncov page,  diversity , shows the known mutations that have been identified so far. as i look at it now, there are maybe 100-200 shown there, but that will change daily and i can not be bothered to count them.  is it possible the virus has mutated twice in a period of time of months  of course it is. that is what we expect from coronaviruses. it would be shocking if it did not.   the default assumption  based on a vast amount of experience with coronaviruses and many other viruses  is that these mutations are neutral and do not affect the virus in terms of fitness, virulence, or transmissibility in any way  they are occasionally useful in tracking sources, but unless you have spent a lot of time looking at virus phylogenetic trees for several years, your interpretations of these mutations are almost certainly wrong.  an example of people making claims based on unfamiliarity with virus evolution is the  two different types of the virus  claim. that claim is addressed by maclean and colleagues in their response to  on the origin and continuing evolution of sars-cov-2 . summary:    two of the key claims made by this paper appear to have been reached by misunderstanding and over-interpretation of the sars-cov-2 data, with an additional analysis suffering from methodological limitations  ",118
"Is there a way to objectively measure or compare how much people believe different governments?

For example, people have accused China of a propaganda campaign to cover up the origins of COVID-19. Another dictatorial regime, Iran, seems to be among the countries hit hardest by the outbreak. On the other hand, North Korea, reports zero known cases of infection.

If one were to ask about non-governmental sources of information, we can point to something like mediabiasfactcheck and other fact-checkers. But those don't exist for governments.

Is there a way to measure and objectively compare how much ""the rest of the world"" believes the information coming out of the government of any given country?
","this has been explored by berens et al.  1 , from the reputation institute, the publishers of the annual reptrak country reputation rankings. in their chapter in the international place branding yearbook 2011, they provide an overview of their methodology, which seeks to measure a country is reputation in much the same way that one might measure the reputation of an individual or a company.   they argue that this reputation is linked intrinsically to the overall international trust of a country, something which is backed up by klewes  amp  wreschniok  2 , which states that the link between reputation and trust is  fundamental and indispensable , arguing that   trust is based on the experience that an agent has fulfilled our expectations in the past.   they list 11 different attributes, which fit into three different dimensions. these are:   advanced economy   an important contributor to global culture is technologically advanced is inventive produces high-quality products and services  appealing environment   offers appealing lifestyle an enjoyable country a beautiful country  effective government    offers a favorable environment for doing business has adopted progressive social and economic policies is a responsible participant in the global community is run by an effective government    the testing methodology consisted of a large random sample  n 26,000  of consumers in the g8 countries, combined with an additional sample  n 19,000  from the country in question drawn from its own citizens. responses were adjusted to take into account general per-country bias - for example, respondents from greece generally will have a good opinion of cyprus.  a further dimension which was measured was  supportive behaviors . this measured the willingness of consumers to visit, live in, invest in, work in, and buy products from the country.  in conclusion then, while the study in question is conducted by surveying populations, it seems possible that a similar study could be conducted which measures at least some of these criteria objectively. certainly, factors such as  willingness to invest  and  technological advancement  could be measured using economic data. however, it would seem that the best way to measure the reputation of a country will probably be to survey the opinions of global respondents through large-scale polling, as the factors that the study found had the most effect on a country is reputation were attributes such as  offers an appealing lifestyle ,  is a responsible participant in the global community , and  is a beautiful country , which would seem to be more abstract factors.  citations   1 : berens g., fombrun c.j., ponzi l.j., trad n.g., nielsen k.  2011  country reptrak tm : a standardized measure of country reputation. in: go f.m., govers r.  eds  international place branding yearbook 2011. palgrave macmillan, london   2 : klewes j., wreschniok r.  2009  reputation capital building and maintaining trust in the 21st century. in: klewes j., wreschniok r.  eds  reputation capital. springer, berlin, heidelberg ",66
"I'm interested in learning more about sampling a changing population over time. For example, these statistics from the University of Washington coronavirus testing show a 7% positive rate day after day. Some news outlets are interpreting this as a positive: ""One encouraging sign is that in Washington State, which had an early outbreak, the number of positive tests appears stable.""

http://depts.washington.edu/labmed/covid19/
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-outcomes.html

Can someone suggest a branch of statistics or papers for further study that would help me assess the veracity of such claims? My intuitive reasoning, as described below, shows why I am questioning the optimistic interpretation, but I would like to learn a more formalized framework.



For instance, let's say that the population proportion that tests positive for an attribute is 7%, and that proportion is stable. If I took a random sample each day, I should be getting 7% consistently, subject to some variance.

However, let's say the population proportion is subject to change over time. Let's also add the assumption that I am trying to prioritize sampling people (without replacement) that I believe are most likely to be positive. Eventually I will sample the whole population. Under these new assumptions, if the population proportion were stable, you would expect my initial sample proportions to overshoot, and my final sample proportions to under shoot as I ran out of likely positives. That would imply that if my sample proportion was constant and did NOT drift down over time, then my population proportion MUST be increasing over time. And if my sample proportion was increasing over time, then my population proportion must be increasing by a heck of a lot over time.

These are just qualitative conclusions I can come to. Is there a branch of statistics I can learn about to help me make concrete conclusions about a changing population proportion given sample proportions over time? I am sure that as you vary the sample size across time, the conclusions also change. Any framework to help understand the tweaks and their effects would be great.

Thank you.
","ok, the service area is likely many hundreds of thousands for the u of washington and for certain patients covers a five state area. the detection rate for a tertiary/quaternary referral center reflects the patient selection process, same criteria for referring patients in distress might lead to same detection rate. however, more precisely one cannot make inferences on that basis because the criteria for patient selection for testing is an uncontrolled variable.  to explain this a bit more, a primary or community hospital would refer patients to a larger regional hospital which refers patients to a specialized tertiary care hospital, and for certain problems, tertiary care hospitals would send patients to a quaternary care facility. even more complicated, a local physician in the community, might refer a patient directly to a quaternary care facility, or the patient might walk in to the emergency room off of the street. so, there are so many confounders that any correlation you might make risks being spurious. btw, the raw data you linked to was not organized for peer review, i review for 17 medical journals, and i am telling you as simply as i can that without controlling for the referral pattern, there is only limited use for the raw data.

"we were intending to travel to Norway ( more days) and Finland (2days) from 18.03.2020 till 1.04.2020. Now due to  the quarantine mandate issued by the Norway government to all foreign nationals entering Norway it's difficult to complete the norway part of our tour. we had a Finnair Flight via Helsinki to Norway and we were leaving from Helsinki after 2 days stay there. 
Under this unusual situation is it possible that we do the entire tour in Finland without visiting Norway at all. Schengen visa has been issued by Norway.
this is an unusual situation as we will be compelled to be in quarantine irrespective of the health status in Norway. so there is no use in visiting the country. But we also do not want to cancel our plan. so checking out and need advice whether we can do the entire tour in Finland though originally Finland constituted a lesser part of our tour.
","i must say that nobody knows what is going to happen and that the situation is developing quickly in europe.  first i would suggest that you talk to your airline. normally if you miss a single segment then the whole rest of your trip  including your return  would be cancelled automatically.  given the circumstances then the airlines are generally being very flexible, but you must first check what they will and will not allow and then change your itinery accordingly and not just not take a flight.   next  or in parrallel  i would suggest contacting your local finnish embassy and explaining the situation. tell them that your schengen visa was issued by norway, that you are flying via helsinki anyway and would now like to spend the enture trip there rather than the couple of days you previously planned. and then ask if they would, given the circumstances, allow you to enter and remain therer for xx days.  it really depends on how flexible they are. they might allow this. they might say that you should get a new visa issued. they might reduce or waive the cost. but you should check first.  if i was you, i would also consider making alternative plans. talk to the airline about rescheduling the trip, as it is likely that they will allow you to do this free of charge at the moment.  only you can judge if this is a worthwhile trip for you given the cirumstances. my personal opinion is that the next two weeks are going to get worse, and it will be awhile before the situation improves.

"Back in January, I booked to stay in Hotel Disneyland Santa Fe in March (in Paris). Due to the effect Covid-19 has had in everyday life and travel, Disneyland Paris had to close including the hotels for guests who were not there at the time of the closing down decision. I contacted Booking.com 5 days before my stay at the Hotel and explained the situation and they said they would get back to me in 24 hours. 

In the meantime, I contacted the hotel and they said that I should only deal with Booking.com as it's their booking to manage. The hotels in Disneyland Paris also announced that for the visitors affected they would offer either a full refund or a chance to reschedule for a later date whilst keeping the same charge for the rooms as the ones in their original booking. 

Now Booking.com says that since the reservation wasn't cancelled beforehand and they're unable to cancel it after the arrival date has passed, they can only offer me half of the money back. I should note that on my initial phone call with them I wasn't told to cancel the booking or do anything for that matter, as they would have to investigate the best way to resolve this. 

The booking was made using my credit card, but since it was made in January, I'm now out of the period that I can ask them to step in and withdraw the money and return them back to my account. 

Is there anything that I can do at this point to make sure I get my money back for a travel that I was not allowed to make considering the hotel was not accepting guests and the French government was cancelling my Eurostar trains at the same time (Eurostar, by the way, has issued a full refund since my trains got cancelled).

"I am not much of a movie watcher, so I'm not looking at Amazon much to rent/stream movies.

But was Amazon renting first-run movies in the $4-$6 range prior to this? It seems unlikely to me, but I thought I'd ask.
","you could not rent first-run movies through amazon before covid-19 shut theaters.  amazon would rent movies that had already hit the rental market for between  2.99 and  5.99, depending on how recently the movie was in theaters. i just checked, amazon still charges  5.99 for parasite, the exact same amount i paid when i rented it through them 6 weeks ago.   with theaters closing, the big studios still wanted a way to show their movies, so they brought them to the rental market sooner and they are charging substantially more because the movie should still be in theaters and charged  19.99 to stay closer to movie ticket prices.  they may have some data that says something like 1.8 people on average watch a movie streamed through amazon, and that is why they charge more than the price of 1 ticket, but i do not know for sure.

"EDIT: After reading the comments and learning more about the current outbreak, I see that the premise of my question is incorrect. I mistakenly believed that the virus' mortality rate was around the same as that of the flu, when in fact it's much higher.



My understanding is that the virus' mortality rate is around 2%, which is similar to the flu. It's less deadly than SARS.

So why are people so worried, and why are governments going to such extreme measures to prevent it from spreading? My guesses are:


We don't know enough about the long-term effects of the virus, so better safe than sorry
The economic and social disruption caused by robust measures (e.g., quarantining) costs less than letting a new disease become pandemic, even if it isn't particularly deadly
Mass hysteria fueled by the media and misinformation
Governments feeling like they have to appear responsive to popular concern lest they seem lazy
This virus affects more developed parts of the world, so it's more visible
The Chinese government's over-the-top, authoritarian, ""only in China""-style measures have left everyone in such awe that they think, ""this must be really serious!"" (When in fact the government's real intention is perhaps to cover up how badly they botched their initial handling of the outbreak.)


As for one's chances of coming into contact with the virus, the total number of confirmed cases in the world as of writing is around 80k. Let's say that the true number is double that, or 160,000. That's still only ~1.5% of the population of Wuhan, the city where the initial outbreak occurred. Why should anyone be in the slightest bit concerned about going for a stroll down the main street?

I'm not an expert in public health or medicine. It would be great to hear an expert's take on this question!
","the danger posed to society from this disease does not come from the mortality rate, rather from the potential to make large fraction of the population ill. unlike the flu virus, this virus is a new virus to which we have no immunity.  about 10  of the infected people requires hospital treatment, which is a lot higher than in case of flu. the death rate of the order of 1  is achieved thanks to excellent hospital treatment. with a far larger fraction of the population infected with this virus compared to the flu and a far larger fraction of the infected people requiring hospital treatment compared to flu, the available hospital capacity to give everyone the treatment they need can be easily exhausted. the death rate due to the virus will then increase.  also, people who need treatment for other reasons can then also fail to get prompt medical attention. people suffering a heart attack who would have survived under normal circumstances thanks to getting prompt medical attention, may now end up dying too.

"," corona  is latin for  crown.  it is used the names of many unrelated objects.  a  corona virus  has a layer of spiky proteins around its surface, so it looks like a crown under an electron microscope.  an electrical coronal discharge happens when the electric field near an object is high enough to ionize the air  it makes a spiky glow that looks kind of like a crown. the ionized air molecules can participate in chemical reactions that are not available to neutral air molecules, and that chemistry is a factor in the aging of high-voltage electrical systems.  in your abstract they write that most modeling of coronal discharges are of direct-current discharges, while they focus on alternating- current  ac  discharges. for an example of the difference between anode and cathode chemistry, see this post.

"I collected the latest data on the coronavirus from Johns Hopkins University as shown and fitted different curves to this data to model the relationship between the number of confirmed patients $P$ who are/were infected as function of time $T$ taking 20-Jan-20 as day 1.





As opposed to applying the standard SIR and SEIR I tried out simple curve fitting to see the general trend. The curve fitting software I used has well known models form different branches of science as well as we could build our own custom models which I did as shown in the image below. The score against the name of a model gives how well a model fits this data. The higher the score, the better the fit and the maximum possible score is 1000. Although we have data only for 18 days (as of 7-Feb 2 AM GMT) one model always kept appearing at top as the best fit and this was the vapor pressure model. After checking for various boundary conditions, I rejected many of models but I could not find any immediately reason to reject the vapor pressure model. Similarly when I modeled the number of reported deaths against time, the vapor pressure model once again gave the best fit which for which I could not find any obvious reasons to reject.



So I did some research on the vapor pressure model.

Basic concept of vapor pressure Because the molecules of a liquid $L$ are in constant motion and possess kinetic energies, at any moment some fraction of them has enough energy to escape from the surface of the liquid to enter the gas phase. This process, called evaporation, generates a vapor pressure $P_L$ above the liquid. Molecules in the gas phase can collide with the liquid surface and reenter the liquid via condensation. Eventually, a steady state is reached in which the number of molecules evaporating and condensing per unit time is the same, and the system is in a state of dynamic equilibrium. Under these conditions, a liquid exhibits a characteristic equilibrium vapor pressure that depends only on the temperature $T_L$. Volatile liquids are liquids with high vapor pressures, which tend to evaporate readily from an open container; nonvolatile liquids have low vapor pressures. When the vapor pressure equals the external pressure, bubbles of vapor form within the liquid, and it boils. We can express the nonlinear relationship between vapor pressure and temperature as an almost linear relationship using the Antoine equation. 

$$
P_L = exp\Big(a + \frac{b}{T_L} + c\log T_L\Big)
$$

Next I did some research what is known about how the coronavirus spreads and if it is related to liquids. Here is what I found. 


  How coronavirus spreads: When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they shed droplets of saliva, mucus, or other bodily fluids. If any of those droplets fall on you—or if you touch them and then, say, touch your face—you can become infected as well. Hospital for communicable diseases define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person for 10 minutes or longer. Time and distance matters.


The coronavirus spreads when it escapes from an infected person through microscopic droplets of liquid carrying the virus through air. I wonder this has anything to do with why the vapor pressure model keeps coming on the top as the best fit even though there is no apparent pressure or temperature as in the vapor pressure equation and I cannot see how they could be elated. May be all this just a mere coincidence. 


  As a bad scientist but a concerned human, I thought I must report this
  observation in case there is anything worth in it.


Question: Given this limited data what can we infer about the corona virus growth rate and how can we reject the vapor pressure model as a mere spurious correlation.

Note 1: I am well aware of spurious correlation. But with only 3 weeks of data, we many not be able to detect a different trend this early. Hence I am reporting the best fit regardless.
"," if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  the dataset you have is small, possibly underrepresented, and of unknown quality, since it is argued that many cases could have not been diagnosed. you observe an exponential growth, a common phenomena in many natural and artificial processes. the curve fits well, but i would bet that other similar curves would also fit well.  notice that the the antoine equation mentioned by you, is a very flexible one, since it can account for constant    alpha  , exponential   b/t l  , and linear   c log t l   growth curves. this makes it easy to fit to many datasets.  moreover, with this kind of data, it may be harder to model it at early stages. notice that you could fit a linear growth model to the earliest period. later, quadratic may fit just fine. later, exponential would fit better, where the exact rate may be hard to catch, since by definition  the more it grows, then the more it grows , and it may easy speed up quite rapidly. it may be easy to fit some curve to such data, but the best test of it, would be a test of time, i.e. validating it on future data.

Are people living with HIV at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19?,"people living with hiv with advanced disease, those with low cd4 and high viral load and those who are not taking antiretroviral treatment have an increased risk of infections and related complications in general. it is unknown if the immunosuppression of hiv will put a person at greater risk for covid-19, thus, until more is known, additional precautions for all people with advanced hiv or poorly controlled hiv, should be employed 1 , 2 .at present there is no evidence that the risk of infection or complications of covid-19 is different among people living with hiv who are clinically and immunologically stable on antiretroviral treatment when compared with the general population. some people living with hiv may have known risk factors for covid-19 complications, such as diabetes, hypertension and other noncommunicable diseases and as such may have increased risk of covid-19 unrelated to hiv. we know that during the sars and mers outbreaks there were only a few case reports of mild disease among people living with hiv. to date, there is a case report of a person living with hiv who had covid-19 and recovered 3  and a small study on risk factors and antiretrovirals used among people living with hiv with covid-19 from china. this study reported similar rates of covid-19 disease as compared to the entire population and increased risk with older age, but not with low cd4, high viral load level or antiretroviral regimen 4 . current clinical data suggest the main mortality risk factors are linked to older age and other comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and hypertension. some very healthy people have also developed severe disease from the coronavirus infection 5 . plhiv are advised to take the same precautions as the general population 6 , 7 : wash hands oftencough etiquette physical distancingseek medical care if symptomaticself-isolation if in contact with someone with covid-19 and other actions per the government response people living with hiv who are taking antiretroviral drugs should ensure that they have at least 30 days and up to 6-month supply of medicines and ensure that their vaccinations are up to date  influenza and pneumococcal vaccines . adequate supplies of medicines to treat co-infections and comorbidities and addiction should also be ensured.",7

"I am wondering about an article in the Economist here:
https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/02/29/covid-19-is-now-in-50-countries-and-things-will-get-worse
There is a graph there


The explanation is as follows
The course of an epidemic is shaped by a variable called the reproductive rate, or R. It represents, in effect, the number of further cases each new case will give rise to. If R is high, the number of newly infected people climbs quickly to a peak before, for want of new people to infect, starting to fall back again (see chart 2). If R is low the curve rises and falls more slowly, never reaching the same heights. With sars-cov-2 now spread around the world, the aim of public-health policy, whether at the city, national or global scale, is to flatten the curve, spreading the infections out over time.

I am having trouble with this. There are 2 curves here. First of all, I am not sure of the different processes that determine them. It says one is without measures. The other is with measures. But it also says one is with high R and the other with low R. Is R a fixed constant for a disease? Alternatively, is there some variability in R and does that degree of variation affect transmission? This is not explained or stated in the article and I haven't heard R described in this way. At best it is not written clearly in my opinion. 

In addition, does without measures necessarily imply high R? Is that what they are getting at? Also, it looks to me as though the blue graph goes to zero very quickly, basically when t is equal to the mean of the orange curve. That means that without measures the epidemic will end quickly (because it exhausts all the possible patients). 

Finally the areas under the two curves is about the same. This means that the number of patients is about the same with or without measures. 

Anyway, can anyone clear up any of this?
","r is a reference to r0, otherwise known as the basic reproductive rate, and means the number of new cases from a single patient infection. r0 has to be above 1 for a disease to persist. it is a classic equation which account for the probability of transmission against immunity. the y-axis is the number of infecteds, very poorly presented.  the idea is that r0 will be lower if there is containment  less people to infect because you can not move around , but will last longer, possibly because the number of naive patients  not encountered the virus  will be larger over a longer period of time.   that particular graph appears to be saying that everyone at risk of infection will get infected with or without control measures  the surface area under the graphs is approximately the same   and the only thing that will halt the virus is acquired immunity. if this is mainstream economic thinking then i beg to differ, albeit i note the source is cdc  again see note  .   for example, all other respiratory viral infections are seasonal. if covid-19 is seasonal containment is the right choice, because the window of transmission is limited.   , given this is of cdc origin i think either its a mistake, or at the very least was taken out of context, because the idea is that overall there is a lower number of people infected as a result of  social distancing  and that does not appear to be what the two curves show.

"I am about to buy an apartment (in a major city in central Europe) to live in, mostly with borrowed capital (around 80%). The price was set before the financial crisis due to the corona virus started. Should I change my plans? Is there any possibility of saying whether the crisis also had an impact on the real estate prices so far? My personal situation is stable in the sense that my job is rather safe despite the crisis. Should I continue to buy the apartment as planned?

Note: I am aware that the future cannot be predicted, what I want to find out is the following: Since the price for ""my"" apartment was set before the corona crisis started, is there already any evidence that the real estate prices in major cities in central Europe have taken a hit? I.e. I am not asking about the future development but rather about a comparison of the situation before the corona crisis to the present situation. 
It would also be interesting whether in the past the stock market was correlated with the real estate prices, particularly during / after crises.
","it is unlikely that you would be able to have firm evidence of a sudden drop in price so rapidly. reason for that is that the real estate market is a bit peculiar: transactions take time to put together and it can take a long time for prices to adjust. the real estate market is not nearly as liquid as the stock market, international commodity markets or flower auctions.  when there is a real estate crash, it is common for the number of transactions to drop while buyers and sellers figure out the new price. sellers, especially individuals who have a lot invested in their house, a  possibly underwater  mortgage to pay back, etc. are not ready to lower their asking price at once. some might prefer to sell their house for the same price several years later rather than selling it at its real price right now. buyers who are concerned about paying too much  like yourself  wait for the price to feel more reasonable relative to everything else. those who need to sell a house before buying another one might also be stuck. and nobody knows exactly where the market might clear in between.  but, right now, you would not expect many real estate transactions to be happening in europe. real estate agencies are forced to close in several countries, it is not possible to visit houses, etc. so it is difficult to have any idea of what the current prices are, whether the drop in the number of transactions reflects a drop in the underlying market or is just a side-effect of the current measures to fight the pandemic, or how fast everything is going to go back to normal.

"Dr. Raoult, who promotes Hydroxychloroquine, has some really intriguing statement about statistics in the biomedical field:


  It's counterintuitive, but the smaller the sample size of a clinical test, the more significant its results are. The differences in a sample of 20 people may be more significant than in a sample of 10,000 people. If we need such a sample, there is a risk of being wrong. With 10,000 people, when the differences are small, sometimes they don't exist. 


Is this a false statement in statistics? If so, is it therefore also false in the Biomedical field? On which basis can we refute it properly, by a confidence interval?

Dr. Raoult promotes Hydroxychloroquine as a cure for Covid-19, thanks to an article about a study on 24 patients. His claims have been repeated a lot because of for this study, but mainly in the mainstream media, not in the scientific press.

In machine learning, the SciKit workflow states that before choosing any model, you NEED a dataset with at least 50 samples, whether it be for a simple regression, or the most advance clustering technique, etc., which is why I find this statement really intriguing.



EDIT: some of the answers below make the assumption of no result bias. They deal with the concept of power and effect size.
However it seems there is a bias in Dr. Raoult data. The most striking being removing data for the dead, for the reason they could not provide data for the entire duration of the study.  

My question remains however focused on the impact of using a small sample size.


Source of the statement about Statistics in a French magazine
Reference to the scientific paper in question.

","i agree with many of the other answers here but think the statement is even worse than they make it out to be.   the statement is an explicit version of an implicit claim in many shoddy analyses of small datasets. these hint that because they have found a significant result in a small sample, their claimed result must be real and important because it is  harder  to find a significant effect in a small sample. this belief is simply wrong, because random error in small samples means that any result is less trustworthy, whether the effect size is large or small. large and significant effects are therefore more likely to be of the incorrect magnitude and more importantly, they can be in the wrong direction. andrew gelman refers to these usefully as notype s  errors  estimates whose sign is wrong  as opposed to notype m  errors  estimates whose magnitude is wrong . combine this with the file-drawer effect  small, non-significant results go unpublished, while large, significant ones are published  and you are most of the way to the replication crisis and a lot of wasted time, effort and money.   thanks to  adrian below for digging up a figure from gelman that illustrates this point well:     this may seem to be an extreme example but the point is entirely relevant to the argument made by raoult.

"I keep hearing people are recovering from COVID-19 virus. Is there any chance that same person can become infected with COVID-19 for a second time? 
","short answer: although there are some reports on this, it is pretty unlikely. it is more likely that patients where released too early from hospital, developed further symptoms later on and got worse, was re-hospitalized, tested again for sars-cov2, which was positive and counted as re-infected.   another possibility is that a false negative test happened, when people got re-tested later the test was positive again and the patient was counted as re-infected. given the rising number of cases worldwide this should become evident pretty soon, if this is a real problem and not an artefact. for the moment, i do not think there is enough evidence for the re-infection of the same patient in such a short time period. if this holds, future will tell.  long answer: there is now an experimental paper, which infected rhesus macaques with sars-cov2, tested if the infection was similar to humans happening in the upper airways  which it was , and re-infected the animals after 28 days with a really high dose of virus  which is much higher than what comes around in our environment , with none of the macaques getting re-infected or showing pathological signs of the infection. see reference 1 for details. this article has its limitations with small sample size and the general questions if the chosen animal model is really comparable with human.   additionally it looks very much like that patients who are recovering do not shed infectious virus anymore. the pcr test however does not discriminate between infectious virus and plain virus rna, so it is most like much longer positive than people are infectious. they also show the rapid appearance of specific antibodies, which would at least temporarily protect against a re-infection. see reference 2 for a nice summary and reference 3 for the original article.  references   reinfection could notoccur in sars-cov-2 infected rhesus macaques people ished  high levels of coronavirus, study finds, but most are likely not infectious after recovery begins clinical presentation and virological assessment of hospitalized cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in a travel-associated transmission cluster  ",41

","if you are interested in the biological or health effects of various chemicals, try to look up the safety data sheet, or  sds  or  msds , for that chemical compound.  going to your favorite search engine and plugging in your chemical of interest to the search term  sds  or  msds  will almost always get you to some kind of answer -- either what you are looking for has a safety data sheet or it does not   in the case of 70  isopropyl alcohol, there are sdss/msdss out there that will tell you what potential health effects are. here is one example for 70  isopropyl alcohol:    potential health effects    eye: produces irritation, characterized by a burning sensation, redness, tearing, inflammation, and possible corneal injury. may cause transient corneal injury. in the eyes of a rabbit, 0.1 ml of 70  isopropyl alcohol caused conjunctivitis, iritis, and corneal opacity.    skin: may cause irritation with pain and stinging, especially if the skin is abraded. isopropanol has a low potential to cause allergic skin reactions  however, rare cases of allergic contact dermatitis have been reported. may be absorbed through intact skin. dermal absorption has been considered toxicologically insignificant. the cases of deep coma associated with skin contact are thought to be a consequence of gross isopropanol vapor inhalation in rooms with inadequate ventilation, rather than being attributable to percutaneous absorption of isopropanol per se.    ingestion: causes gastrointestinal irritation with nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. may cause kidney damage. may cause central nervous system depression, characterized by excitement, followed by headache, dizziness, drowsiness, and nausea. advanced stages may cause collapse, unconsciousness, coma and possible death due to respiratory failure. aspiration of material into the lungs may cause chemical pneumonitis, which may be fatal. the probable oral lethal dose in humans is 240 ml  2696 mg/kg , but ingestion of only 20 ml  224 mg/kg  has caused poisoning.    inhalation: inhalation of high concentrations may cause central nervous system effects characterized by nausea, headache, dizziness, unconsciousness and coma. may cause narcotic effects in high concentration. causes upper respiratory tract irritation. inhalation of vapors may cause drowsiness and dizziness.    chronic: prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause defatting and dermatitis.   safety data sheets sound terrible  but in reality, people use rubbing alcohol with common sense, without putting into their eyes, without drinking it, etc.   mainly the point of this answer is to help you find the answer for yourself, if you want to find out about this or other chemicals you might be worried about.

Can I get these loans and unemployment?,"this was the most commonly asked question. the cares act not only provides relief for small business owners through loans but also allows the self-employed, independent contractors and part-time workers to collect unemployment benefits. that initially seemed like double dipping to me. but as a colleague in the twitterverse pointed out, it could make sense if your unemployment is covering personal expenses while your eidl and/or ppp is covering other operating expenses. for example, if you are a restaurant owner, you have to pay for a mortgage, paid leave and supply chain disruptions, while we all wait out stay-at-home orders. but you also have to buy groceries and pay your home utility bills. if you can only get a loan to cover business expenses, you may still need unemployment benefits to pay your personal expenses. keep in mind, the details for unemployment benefits -- eligibility rules, benefit amounts, length of payments, etc. -- vary from state to state. in illinois, for instance, to maintain your eligibility for unemployment, you must be able to work, you have to be available to accept a job and you have to be looking for work. if the additional loan funds allow you to keep running your business, it may be hard to demonstrate that you are out of work. i have already heard from a few self-employed people who have applied for unemployment--and had widely varying results. most likely the rules will become clearer in time, as the states decide what will and will not be allowed.",111
"When calculating how lethal a virus outbreak is, I've noticed that most sources use 

CONFIRMED_DEATHS/CONFIRMED_INFECTIONS


However, given that there are only 2 possible outcomes; death or recovery, wouldn't it be more logical to use:

CONFIRMED_DEATHS/(CONFIRMED_DEATHS + CONFIRMED_RECOVERIES)


Which formula is applicable to which situations?
","this may not strike most as a bioinformatics, but getting the key clinical outcome is essential in understanding the molecular basis of pathogenicity.  i think the mortality rate is over-reported. this is not to say the situation of 2019-ncov is not serious - it is very serious.  the two essential factors missing in your equation for 2019-ncov are:   age. mortality is likely skewed towards the old and very young seroprevalence. to identify the number of asymptomatic patients.   old people have a weakened immune system  e.g. reduced t-cell response . the very young have an underdeveloped immune system. the problem is hospital cases are skewed towards those with severe infection, which is likely the old and very young. in 2019-ncov the first infecteds were middle aged men, but likely to be restricted to those exposed to the  wuhan meat market .  problem  asymptomatic  spreaders  are known in influenza and are suspected in 2019-ncov. asymptomatics will inflate the mortality rate  because we are not detecting them .  solution s    one solution is to conduct seroprevalence surveys. serological surveys screening for antibodies  igg  against 2019-ncov will identify asymptomatic patients, using the first formula you stated. however, would you seriously go around the general population in a 2019-ncov epidemic taking blood samples  errhhh no. the bio-statistics approach is to use a catalytic model and critical to this is the age of the patient. catalytic models are a priori models that incorporates the age-prevelance profile of infection. by introducing the incidence and age of hospitalisation of e.g. the old and the young, the rest of the distribution, i.e. asymptomatics can be calculated by regression. this estimates the total population of infecteds and again you use equation 1 to calculate the mortality rate recorded by the hospital. mathematical models based on transmission dynamics. the problem here is the rate of transmission is unknown.   i would assume the hospital is the place virus-induced mortality is reasonably accurate.  the second formula you described works very well for ebolavirus, no-one has ever heard of asymptomatic ebolavirus. it would also work well for another betacoronavirus middle eastern respiratory syndrome. the key problem with 2019-ncov is we do not know the number of asymptomatic patients or patients with such mild infections they never report illness.   summary in summary, i think the mortality is being over-reported if it is based on your equation 2. equation 1, however, will also over-report the mortality rate.

We know the virus can live on hard surfaces. What about clothing?,"it probably can -- but you should not be overly worried. here is why. so far, there are not scientific findings on how long the virus can live on fabric. but fabrics are generally porous -- as is cardboard, which has been tested. and a recent study did find that the virus can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours.  the thing that you have to consider, though, is that those tests are done in ideal testing circumstances,  says rachel graham, a virologist at the university of north carolina.  that is like in some kind of hermetically sealed box where there is no fluctuation in humidity, there is no wind, there is nothing that can contribute toward desiccating the virus. and so desiccation -- or drying out the virus -- would actually reduce the amount of time it is actually viable on any kind of surface.  plus, porousness is a good thing when it comes to avoiding viral transmission. a surface that is permeable, like a fabric, tends to trap viruses more easily than hard surfaces.  it is less at risk of transmitting because the virus gets kind of stuck to the  porous  surface, and so it can not be easily transferred back off of it,  graham says.  porous surfaces also suck the fluid out of it. the viral membrane is a lipid membrane, and so if that becomes dried out, it is basically done, infectivity-wise.  if you are concerned that clothing or other fabric items might have picked up the virus, throw the clothing in the washer and dryer. for most situations, says graham, your detergent will do its job and get rid of any infective particles -- or at least sanitize them to the point where they are not a risk to you. if you are taking care of someone who is ill or immunocompromised or if you are working in a health care setting, you may want to take additional precautions. the centers for disease control and prevention has recommendations for households with suspected or confirmed cases of the coronavirus, which include wearing gloves when handling dirty laundry from an ill person and using the warmest appropriate water setting when washing clothes or linens to disinfect them. i like to use wipes to disinfect surfaces in my home -- especially surfaces that are frequently touched. but how much surface area can one wipe be used on before it loses its ability to kill the coronavirus  the first step is to check the label on the wipes you are using. for instance, the label on a container of clorox wipes instructs:  use enough wipes for treated surface to remain visibly wet for 4 minutes. to kill viruses, let stand 15 seconds.  that time and that visible wetness are important, says erica hartmann, an expert in environmental microbiology at northwestern university is mccormick school of engineering. regardless of the particular ingredients in the wipes you are using,  they are all chemicals that have to react,  she says.  and those chemical reactions are not instantaneous -- they take a certain amount of time. so what you are doing when you are keeping the surface wet is you are basically allowing time, allowing the chemical reactions to take place.  so if that clorox wipe is not making the surface visibly wet for 4 minutes, you are trying to cover too much ground with one wipe. there is no exact figure for how much surface area a wipe can handle. but a 2018 study found that one wipe is generally more effective over 1 to 2 square feet than 8 square feet. and you do not need a premade wipe to clean surfaces: you can also use a liquid product on a cloth or paper towel. the centers for disease control and prevention advises using products that contain bleach  sodium hypochlorite  or alcohol  at least 70   and following the manufacturer is directions. you can make your own cleaning solution by mixing 4 teaspoons of bleach per quart of water, according to the cdc. the u.s. environmental protection agency has posted a list of approved products to disinfect against the coronavirus. strangers keep petting my dog when we go for a walk. could my dog transmit the virus on its fur  saskia popescu, an infection prevention epidemiologist at the health care system honorhealth, says she is not especially concerned about dog fur transmitting the virus.  i think that i would probably be more worried if somebody was coughing all over the place and went to touch my dog is harness or something -- something inanimate,  she says.  i would put it in the lower-risk category.  that is because like fabric, fur is a porous surface -- so it is not easy for a person to pick up bits of virus from it.  the chances of you getting it from fur and hair is going to be less than getting it from a solid surface,  says graham, the virologist. still, she said, she would err on the side of caution and ask people not to pet your dog right now. graham says one way to make sure your dog does not get touched by overenthusiastic petters is to avoid letting your dog off leash in a place where it may encounter other people. rather than going to a dog park, she says,  it might be a better idea to take your dog out in the yard or somewhere you know that there is not going to be a lot of people.  and despite the occasional media report of a dog diagnosed with covid-19, there is no evidence that pets can contract or spread covid-19. the cdc says it has not received any reports of pets or animals becoming sick with the disease. the american veterinary medical association concurs:  infectious disease experts and multiple international and domestic human and animal health organizations agree there is no evidence at this point to indicate that pets become ill with covid-19 or that they spread it to other animals, including people.  one note: if you are already sick with covid-19, the association recommends limiting contact with animals  out of an abundance of caution  until more is known about the virus. if you are not sick with the coronavirus, the group says you can interact with your pet as you normally would -- while practicing good hygiene, including washing your hands before and after interacting with your pet.",26
Should I refinance my mortgage?,"it could be a good idea, but lenders are overwhelmed right now, so expect the process of shopping and closing to take time. when mortgage rates fall to record lows, as we have seen in recent weeks, refinancing can be a good way to save some extra cash or  to shorten your loan term  http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/business/mortgage-refinance- delays.html  and pay it off faster. if you shorten your loan term to 15 years from 30 years, your monthly payments are likely to rise, but you will have more flexibility in your budget sooner than you would have had.",56
Should people in their 60s be concerned? Are they considered elderly?,"as with seasonal flu, people at highest risk for severe disease and death include people over the age of 60 and those with underlying conditions, according to the world health organization.     starting at age 60, there is an increasing risk of disease and the risk increases with age. the highest risk of serious illness and death is in people older than 80 years,  nancy messonnier, director of the cdc is national center for immunization and respiratory diseases, told reporters in a recent telebriefing.    the cdc recommends that people over 60 stock up on supplies, keep away from others who are sick, limit close contact, wash hands often, avoid crowds as much as possible, avoid cruises and do not fly on planes unless absolutely necessary.",28
"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?","not yet. to date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat covid-2019. however, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. people with serious illness should be hospitalized. most patients recover thanks to supportive care.  possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. they are being tested through clinical trials. who is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat covid-19.  the most effective ways to protect yourself and others against covid-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter  3 feet  from people who are coughing or sneezing.",49

"My wife had a return flight ticket from Seoul to Barcelona via Istanbul at Turkish Airlines for March 6th. We received a mail today (March 2nd) saying please call our Call Center. We called and they said the flight was cancelled. They gave us the options for a refund or change. When asking which changes were possible, they offered the same flight for the 11th of March. I asked if there could be some problem because of the novel coronavirus and they said they had no information. We changed our flight to March 11th, because they said that if the same happened again and it was cancelled again we could get the refund.

Now I've learnt in IATA's list (https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm, update from March 1st) about Turkish ban of non-turkish nationals who have been to Korea recently. I think it isn't likely this ban will disappear soon (right?) so we're looking for alternatives like flights via Germany or direct flights to Barcelona.

Now I'm worried that if Turkish Airlines actually does their March 11th flight but they don't let any non-turkish nationals on, they may argue that no refund is possible because it's the passenger responsibility to check that they have all the rights to enter the countries for every layover, at the time they get the flight. Are we going to get a refund? I called the Call Center again but they said they had no information about this.

My wife is Korean but she is currently living in the EU. I think they should have known that because of my wife's nationality she was not allowed to travel. The ticket fare was the cheapest, no cancellations allowed. We had booked the 1st flight before the novel coronavirus was discovered.
","you are correct, that it is the passenger is responsibility to check that they have all the rights to enter the countries for every layover. in particular, if you are not allowed to board, then turkish airlines will not be required to give any compensation.  the good news is, that the travel advisory does not prohibit people from transiting through turkey. in fact, since practically all europe -- us flights are cancelled due to the travel bans of both countries, this is the currently the cheapest way for me to transit between the two, given that i have the right to enter both. get on a turkish airlines flight from europe to istanbul, and from there a turkish airlines flight from istanbul to the us. since turkey is not on the travel ban of either country, the flights continue as planned. also, since i am not  entering  turkey but merely transiting through it, this is also allowed by turkey.  p.s., i am aware that this particular flight had been cancelled  the above is general advice for others in the same situation.

"In this link, in the section How long is it between when a person is exposed to the virus and when they start showing symptoms? mentions

"For context, Australia, where I live, currently sits at ~130 confirmed cases, which makes me feel relatively safe for now, but naturally this will get worse with time as other countries' examples suggest.

Specifically, I mean cycling without a group (i.e. maintaining a good degree of separation from any other humans at any given time).

","the long and short of it is that the novel coronavirus can be experimentally aerosolized where it can persist in the air for several hours but a number of studies have failed to detect virus in samples taken from the air of the rooms of patients with active disease. but virus has been detected in aerosols near bathrooms surfaces indicates that it is spread over a long distance with mechanical assistance  flushing  . sars was also spread by one patient with diarhoea with malfunctioning sewer systems aerolized the virus across multiple floors of a building.    both the covid-19 and the sars viruses had an aerosol half-life of 2.7 hours, meaning half the particles drop out of the air after that amount of time, and half of what remains drop out after another 2.7 hours. after a day, roughly nine half-lives, 0.002  0.2 of 1   of the original particles remain. as a result, the scientists said,  aerosol ... transmission of  the new coronavirus  is plausible, as the virus can remain viable in aerosols for multiple hours.    the usual spread may be via contaminated surfaces  probably on the cruise ships  and respiratory transmission less so since the rate of symptomatic infection among a patient is household members was 10.5   since you are outside based on the above, the viral load would be miniscule.  http://www.statnews.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-can-become-aerosol-doesnt-mean-doomed/  http://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v2.full.pdf  not peer reviewed yet   ",52

"So a series of news articles are being spread around that purportedly attributes some of Bernie Sanders' losses in states due to low voter turnout.   A quick search on Google reports tens of articles all claiming the same or similar findings:


Google search


However, I recently saw an article on Reddit that says this claim is being falsified by purposely misattributing one statistic as another, but I don't know how verifiable the information is considering it's not a news source I'm familiar with.


Bernie Sanders and the Myth of Low Youth Turnout in the Democratic Primary


If anything, I am more wary of the quantity of news reports. Earlier this month, Snopes.com published a fact-checking article disproving a wide swathe of news reports that Corona beer sales dropped due to fear about the coronavirus, and this is something I am not sure is also going on with the Sanders/youth voter turnout issue.

In any case, did low youth turnout affect Bernie Sanders' results in the Super Tuesday primaries?  Or, as the 2nd linked article claims, is it not true?
","there is a lot of spin going on in all camps, including the sanders camp. this is par for the course in a political election year.  the article you cited is guilty of the same criticisms it makes of other articles. it fails to provide any concise information about how many voters in the 18-29 age range in 2020 turned out compared to 2016.  in fairness, this is partly because election officials do not track voters by age when they vote. so the only way to know anything about this kind of metric is to look at the same exit polls the article rejects as inaccurate.  the sanders campaign, like other campaigns, do their own polling and sampling. so they have pretty much the best idea of anyone as to how well they have really done. so listen to what bernie himself said:   have we been as successful as i would hope in bringing in young people in  and the answer is  no ,  he told reporters at a press briefing on wednesday.   we are making some progress but historically everybody knows that young people do not vote in the kind of numbers that older people vote,  sanders went on.  i think that will change in the general election. but to be honest with you, we have not done as well in bringing young people into the process. it is not easy.   source: http://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-admits-hes-not-inspiring-enough-young-voters-2020-3  however, that is not the only thing we can infer from available data. if you put together a spreadsheet state-by-state to tally vote totals compared to votes received by sanders, you will see a strong pattern. the data shows that sanders  overall vote count is running 20-30  lower than in 2016 in most states that have voted so far, despite the fact that across-the-board vote count is running 10-30  higher than in 2016. sanders defenders argue that this is because the field was so much bigger and stronger than in 2016, but i see this as a throwaway argument. if sanders was really a strong vote-getter, he would not be bleeding support compared to 2016 because the ones who voted for him then already knew him, whereas his opponents this year were mostly newcomers to the primaries. he already had name recognition that the others did not have among democratic voters.  so what does this broader insight tell us  well, all of the polls we have seen say that sanders  support levels are strongest among the 18-29 age range. so if he is hemorrhaging that much voter support in the overall numbers, it either means that the number of voters in the 18-29 range matched 2016 while the rest of his supporters disappeared almost completely into the woodwork, or  much more likely  his support among 18-29 year olds sagged compared to four years ago along with the other age groups.  given sanders  remarks business insider quoted, i would go with the latter likelihood.

"My wife (a Kazakh national) is visiting in the UK on a Standard Visitor Visa, staying with my family. She arrived on Feb 1st. Her original intention was to stay for approximately 3 months, until April 30th, and stated as such on her application form. She had been to the UK twice already, and had always departed in line with her intentions as originally stated during her previous applications. Her current visa expires in July.  

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Kazahkstan will institute a one-month travel ban from tonight, preventing flights into the country. I'm a little concerned about what should happen if the ban is extended beyond that. 

I understand that the Home Office generally frowns upon visitors who stay longer than their stated intentions, even if they do not overstay their visa lengths. But if the Kazakh travel ban prevents her from travelling back to her country until a date beyond April 30th, might this cause a problem in her future visa applications? Or is it a reasonable excuse, and provided she explains the extended duration of her previous stay during the future application, might it be okay? 

Edit: On that note, she applied for this UK visa from China (where we lived at the time). Obviously, returning to China at this point, while theoretically possible (though we'd have to apply for new Chinese visas; they expired in February, a fact that she readily disclosed in her application), is hardly desirable. This is a circumstance that we could hardly have predicted beforehand. Her Chinese visa was temporary and she acknowledged this fact during her application. Might the UK officials think ""well, you couldn't fly to Kazakhstan, sure, but why not go back to China? After all, you applied from there"" ? I must stress that she never stated during her application that she intended to go back to China; indeed our plan was always for her to fly to Kazakhstan around April 30th, the original envisaged date of departure. Am I overthinking this, and would the specific country that she'd go to after departing the UK be of no concern to them whatsoever? 
","normally, the uk authorities take a dim view of significant changes because they consider that someone who applies for a short visit but then stays very much longer is probably working illegally.  however, these are extraordinary times, and if your wife finds herself stuck because of travel restrictions she should have no problem if she explains that in future visa applications.  note, however, that if she finds that she needs to stay beyond her visa she must contact the authorities to make arrangements for a longer stay.  fwiw, the countries that have imposed travel bans  there is a list on the ny times  have not applied them to their own citizens. your wife is likely to be allowed to travel, but might find it impossible to do so because flights are not available.

"0 Introduction

This is my third attempt in tuning a good prediction SIRD model for the COVID-19 outbreak. The model in question is the following:
$$\tag{12}\begin{cases}
S_{t}&amp;=S_{t-1}-\alpha\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N} \\ 
I_{t}&amp;=I_{t-1}+\alpha\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N}-\beta I_{t-1}-\gamma I_{t-1} \\
R_{t}&amp;=R_{t-1}+\beta I_{t-1} \\
D_{t}&amp;=D_{t-1}+\gamma I_{t-1} \\
\end{cases} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots$$



0.1 first attempt

In my first try I've used for the estimation of the parameters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ a very simple strategy by searching the least squares parameters that minimize the quadratic cost of the 1-step prediction along all the observation horizon. The complete dissertation of this problem is here (note: in this thread I will use the same notations that I've used in the cited thread).
The estimation problem is very easy to resolve, but leads to a result with very poor performances.



0.2 second attempt

As Sextus Empiricus suggests to me, using the 1-step prediction, i.e.
$$\tag{13}\hat{y}_t(\theta)=\varphi_t \theta + y_{t-1} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0, 1, 2,\dots$$
is not a good idea because, once one has found the parameters, during the simulation phase the model haves to feedback the proper previous predictions. This means, in principle, that the right way to tune the parameters $\theta$ is to minimize some suitable cost function of the prediction errors generated by a ""batch"" predictor of the form
$$\tag{14}\hat{y}_t(\theta)=\hat\varphi(\hat{y}_{t-1}) \theta + \hat{y}_{t-1} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0, 1, 2,\dots$$
where
$$\tag{15}\hat\varphi(\hat{y}_{t-1}) \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    -\frac{\hat{S}_{t-1}\hat{I}_{t-1}}{N} &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\ 
    \phantom{-}\frac{\hat{S}_{t-1}\hat{I}_{t-1}}{N} &amp; -\hat{I}_{t-1} &amp; -\hat{I}_{t-1}  \\  
    0 &amp; \phantom{-}\hat{I}_{t-1} &amp; 0\\  
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; \phantom{-}\hat{I}_{t-1}
\end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots$$
and $\hat{S}_{t-1}, \hat{I}_{t-1}$ are predictions (and not observed values) generated by the model. As a consequence, the new estimation problem 
$$\tag{16}\theta_\text{LS}\triangleq \arg\min_{\theta \in \mathbb{R^3}} V_T (\theta)$$
with the same quadratic cost $V_T(\theta)\triangleq \frac{1}{2}\sum _{t=0}^T \|y_t-\hat{y}_t(\theta) \|^2$ is not easy anymore because now the considered model $(14)$ is not linear in his parameter $\theta$.

To resolve $(16)$, under the suggestion Sextus Empiricus, I've chosen a numerical approach. More precisely, I've used a simple gradient descent equipped with Armijo's adaptive learning rate / step update, with a simple finite-difference approximation of the gradient. The optimization works pretty well, but from the starting guess $\theta_{\text{LS},0}=0$ converges to a parameter $\theta_{\text{LS},\infty}$ with a non-zero cost that doesn't satisfies me in the final simulation phase.

I've tried several different optimizations by using randomly different initializations $\theta_{\text{LS},0}$ (like a MultiStart global optimization policy) with even worse results. 



0.3 third attempt

I'm quite sure that the optimizer works well, so I believe that to improve the performance of the final simulator it is necessary to increase the expressivity of the model $(12)$.
To make a step ahead towards an acceptable solution, under the observations of Sextus Empiricus, now I want make an attempt where I increase the difficult of the estimation problem by relaxing the time-invariance hypothesis of the parameters. Thus, now I consider this more complicated model 
$$\tag{17}\begin{cases}
S_{t}&amp;=S_{t-1}-\alpha_t\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N} \\ 
I_{t}&amp;=I_{t-1}+\alpha_t\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N}-\beta_t I_{t-1}-\gamma_t I_{t-1} \\
R_{t}&amp;=R_{t-1}+\beta_t I_{t-1} \\
D_{t}&amp;=D_{t-1}+\gamma_t I_{t-1} \\
\end{cases} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots$$
The actual ""dynamic"" estimation problem can be solved by using a Kalman filter.

note: as mentioned by Sextus Empiricus, another possible approach to the problem is to tune the parameters by using the explicit solution of the SIRD model. I don't want follow this way because, as a student in control system engineering, I'm interested in learn how to identify generic dynamical systems in their implicit state-space representations. The SIRD problem is a ""toy example"" that I'm trying to resolve better as possible in my quarantine free-time. 

1 Kalman Filtering

1.1 dynamic system model

Consider the following linear, time-variant and autonomous state-space model for a dynamic system 
$$\tag{18}\begin{cases} x_{t+1} &amp;= A_t x_t+w_t \\ y_t &amp;= C_t x_t+v_t \end{cases}\qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots$$
where $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the state vector, $y \in \mathbb{R}^p$ is the output vector of the system and the parameters $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and $C \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times n}$ are matrices. The signals $w\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $v\in \mathbb{R}^p$ are white noises characterized respectively by null mean values and covariances $Q\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$  and $R\in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$, i.e.
$$\begin{align} w_t &amp;= \text{wn}(0,Q_t) \\ v_t &amp;= \text{wn}(0,R_t) \end{align}\qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots \tag{19}$$



1.2 Kalman filter definition 

The Kalman filter is another dynamic system that estimates dynamically the state of the system $(18)$ by watching the model $(18)$ and a dataset $D\triangleq\{y_0, y_1, y_2, \dots\}$ of observed outputs. The estimation process is a recursion starting from the initial state $x_0$, that is unknown and modelled as a random variable with mean value $\hat{x_0}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and covariance $P_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, i.e.
$$\tag{20} x_0 \sim (\hat{x}_0, P_0)$$
At every time instant $t=1,2,3,\dots$ the recursion is splitted in two different steps:


correction: the filter computes the estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t}$ of the state $x_t$ by considering all the observed past values $y_0,y_1, \dots, y_{t-1}$, summarized in a predicted estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t-1}$, and the actual observation $y_t$. Such estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t}$ is characterized by the covariance $P_{t|t}$; 
prediction: the filter computes the estimate $\hat{x}_{t+1|t}$ of the state $x_{t+1}$ by considering the first equation of the model $(18)$. Such estimate $\hat{x}_{t+1|t}$ is characterized by the covariance $P_{t+1|t}$. 


the Kalman filter algorithm is the following
$$\boxed{\begin{align} 
\text{FOR}\quad &amp;t=1,2,3,\dots :\\
&amp;e_t \triangleq y_t - C_t \hat{x}_{t|t-1} \\
&amp;S_t \triangleq  C_t P_{t|t-1}C_t'+R_t \\
&amp;L_t \triangleq  P_{t|t-1}C_t' S_t ^{-1} \\
&amp;\text{1) correction}\\
&amp;\hat{x}_{t|t} \triangleq \hat{x}_{t|t-1}+L_t e_t \\
&amp;P_{t|t} \triangleq (I-L_t C_t)P_{t|t-1}(I-L_t C_t)'+L_t R_t L_t'\\
&amp;\text{2) prediction}\\
&amp;\hat{x}_{t+1|t} \triangleq A_t \hat{x}_{t|t}\\
&amp;P_{t+1|t} \triangleq A_t P_{t|t}A_t'+ Q_t
\end{align}}\tag{21}$$
note: if $x_0$, $w_t$, $v_\tau$, are gaussians and incorrelated for all the possible choices of $t, \tau$ then at every time istant $t$ the estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t}$ is by definition the MMSE estimate of the state $x_t$, so the Kalman Filter finds the optimal estimation of the state $x_t$.

note: the signal $e_t$ is called innovation and it is the prediction error of the output of the system $(18)$ (since the predicted output generated by the Kalman filter is $\hat{y}_{t|t-1}=C_t \hat{x}_{t|t-1}$). Here the matrix $S_t$ is the covariance of the innovation (and not the number of susceptibles at time $t$, I hope that it is clear from the context when I'm talking about the innovation covariance or the number of susceptibles). The matrix $L_t$ is called correction gain since it is used to define the corrected estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t}$. The matrix $I$ is an identity matrix $n \times n$.

note: the initialization is $\hat{x}_{1|0}\triangleq \hat{x}_0$, $P_{1|0} \triangleq P_0$.



1.3 application to the SIRD estimation problem: static estimation

Before to jump in to the more general problem that involves the model $(17)$, I want to use the Kalman filter to make a more simpler ""static"" estimation of the parameters.
In order to use the Kalman filter, the idea is to define the following non-linear, time-variant, static system
$$\begin{cases}x_{t+1} &amp;=x_t+w_t \\
y_t &amp;=h_t(x_t)+v_t\end{cases}\qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots \tag{22}$$
where 
$$x_t \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    \alpha_t  \\ 
    \beta_t  \\  
    \gamma_t \\  
\end{bmatrix} \qquad 
y_t \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    S_t  \\ 
    I_t  \\  
    R_t \\  
    D_t 
\end{bmatrix} \qquad 
h_t(x_t) \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    {S}_{t-1}-\frac{{S}_{t-1}{I}_{t-1}}{N}\alpha_t \\ 
    {I}_{t-1}-{I}_{t-1}\beta_t-{I}_t\gamma_t+\frac{{S}_{t-1}{I}_{t-1}}{N}\alpha_t  \\  
    {R}_{t-1}+{I}_{t-1}\beta_t \\  
    {D}_{t-1}+{I}_{t-1}\gamma_t 
\end{bmatrix} \\ \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots \tag{23}
$$
the system $(22)$ is not linear, so the idea to deal with this problem is to consider a simple linearization around the estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t-1}$of the output equation (like in an extended Kalman filter). 
$$y_t \approx h_t(\hat{x}_{t|t-1})+\frac{\partial h_t}{\partial x_t}\Bigg|_{x_t=\hat{x}_{t|t-1}}(x_t-\hat{x}_{t|t-1})+v_t \tag{24}$$
by defining the new coordinates
$$\tilde{y}_t \triangleq y_t-h_t(\hat{x}_{t|t-1}) \qquad \tilde{x}_t \triangleq x_t -\hat{x}_{t|t-1} \tag{25}$$
and the time-variant matrix
$$C_t \triangleq \frac{\partial h_t}{\partial x_t}\Bigg|_{x_t=\hat{x}_{t|t-1}}=\begin{bmatrix}
    -\frac{\hat{S}_{t-1}\hat{I}_{t-1}}{N} &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\ 
    \phantom{-}\frac{\hat{S}_{t-1}\hat{I}_{t-1}}{N} &amp; -\hat{I}_{t-1} &amp; -\hat{I}_{t-1}  \\  
    0 &amp; \phantom{-}\hat{I}_{t-1} &amp; 0\\  
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; \phantom{-}\hat{I}_{t-1}
\end{bmatrix} \tag{26}$$
the system $(22)$ is approximated by the linear system
$$\begin{cases}\tilde{x}_{t+1} &amp;=\tilde{x}_t+w_t \\
\tilde{y}_t &amp;=C_t \tilde{x}_t+v_t\end{cases}\qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots \tag{27}$$
at this point it is possible to apply the Kalman filter $(21)$ to get an estimation for the parameters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$.



1.4 application to the SIRD estimation problem: dynamic estimation

In order to take into account the time dependency of the parameters it is sufficient to modify the first equation of the system $(22)$ in a suitable way that reflects approximately the real dynamic of the parameters
$$\begin{cases}x_{t+1} &amp;=f_t(x_t)+w_t \\
y_t &amp;=h_t(x_t)+v_t\end{cases}\qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots \tag{28}$$
in other words, the dynamic of the parameters $\alpha_t, \beta_t,\gamma_t$ is described by the motion model $f_t(x_t)$. To get an estimate of theese parameters it is possible to use an extended Kalman filter like in the previous section 1.3. 



2 My Questions

Before to writing down some code to get experimental responses, I'd like to have some suggestions about the previous dissertation. I have also two questions.


I'm not sure that $C_t$ is well defined. Let's assume that his definition $(26)$ is correct. Since the prediction model is $(14)$, that is a dynamic model, the quantities $\hat{S}_{t-1}$ and $\hat{I}_{t-1}$ are functions of all the previous predictions $\hat{y}_0 (\theta=\hat{x}_{t|t-1}),\hat{y}_1 (\theta=\hat{x}_{t|t-1}), \dots, \hat{y}_{t-2} (\theta=\hat{x}_{t|t-1})$. This means that at every time step the computational burden to get $C_t$ increase because it requires the simulation with the actual parameter $\theta=\hat{x}_{t|t-1}$ of the system $(12)$ up to time $t-2$ (that is increasing). It is possible to define a more efficient recursive formula to define $C_t$?
How can we define a reasonable motion model $f_t(x_t)$ that can take into account the observations made by Sextus Empiricus in the reply in my first thread?

","nice write-up. i think eq 23 is not quite correct though. the observation  y t  should be a function of the state  x t  and noise  v t , like you said in eq 22  y t   h x t    v t .  the issue with eq 23 is that  y t  depends on  y  t-1  . this would break the markov assumption that  x t  is a sufficient state, which is foundational to the kalman filter formulation.  i think the correct approach is to use    x t :   begin bmatrix  s t    i t    r t    d t     alpha t     beta t     gamma t  end bmatrix      this would be considered  augmenting the state   sird  with the parameters    alpha ,  beta ,  gamma   to do a  joint-state-parameter  estimation.  your dynamic would be    x  t 1    begin bmatrix    s   t - frac  s   t  i   t   n  alpha t       i   t - i   t  beta t- i  t gamma t  frac  s   t  i   t   n  alpha t       r   t   i   t  beta t       d   t   i   t  gamma t    f  alpha x t   f  beta x t     f  gamma x t   end bmatrix    w t     you can treat the sird part of the dynamic as deterministic if you so desire by setting its entries of the covariance  q t of  w t  to  0 , though that places all the uncertainty on the initial condition and parameters, which i do not think accurately reflects reality - the sird model is not perfect even with best-fit parameters.  your observation model would be the actual data, which we would consider to be measurements of the sird part of the state, corrupted by noise  which you can remove by making its covariance  r t  approx 0  if you think the sird records are perfect .    y t    begin bmatrix  s t    i t    r t    d t  end bmatrix    v t     as for what you should design for  f  alpha x t   and the other parameter dynamics, i think a random walk is fine  i.e.  f  alpha x t     alpha t  so all the movement is due to the   alpha -component of  w t  . but really i think designing a more sophisticated structure for that is a matter of studying epidemiology more. by creating a structured dynamic for the parameters, you are essentially making a more detailed model than what sird alone captures. such an advanced design should probably be rooted in hard science, else it just becomes excess model capacity ripe for overfitting / poor generalization.  in other words, if you want a model for how the parameters would move, you should come up with an explanation / mechanism for why they would move. what do these parameters mean - what dynamical factors would influence them   by the way, the selection of the noise covariances is pretty critical to the usefulness of the kalman filter. if you are using them as tuning knobs rather than estimating them from data, you might as well just go back to your second approach  nonlinear regression of a multi-step predictor  and just use gauss-newton is method instead of gradient descent for optimization. the extended kalman filter is essentially a covariance-weighted recursive application of gauss-newton least-squares.

"A January 14 WHO tweet that has been widely re-broadcast months later by the right-wing US press (e.g. NYPost, WashExam but not exclusively by them, e.g. Bloomberg opinion piece, Politico o.p.) said that:


  Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China.


The WHO is lampooned for this moment by the aforementioned media pieces, but these don't really say when the WHO came to a different conclusion regarding human-to-human transmission. So when did that happen, and what information source did the WHO use for the latter determination?

"What practical approaches are recommended or possible to minimize covid-19 exposure during child visitation, weekend visit, with the non-custodial parent?  Are there medical or legal guidelines on this topic?  (I live in Georgia, in the USA.)
","first: we are not able to answer legal questions, so do not take this as really addressing the legal side of things. look up those details in your area specifically or ask a lawyer for that.  in general, visitation is likely still possible currently. see this advice from nolo:    how do social distancing rules affect custody arrangements       the social distancing and shelter-in-place rules do not directly affect custody orders, so you should continue following your current custody arrangement unless you and your ex agree to an alternative plan or a judge changes your custody order.    courts are making it clear that disobeying court orders or withholding visitation during this time will not be tolerated and may result in contempt of court. but if you have valid concerns about your child is health and safety, you can try communicating with your ex to see what you can both do to reduce the risks to your child.    within a family unit, creating an effective social distancing plan can be as simple as adopting rules for parents and children to follow within their home. but for divorced or separated parents, social distancing and staying healthy when children are going back and forth between two households can be challenging.     an example of a state issuing guidance on this is delaware:    to be clear, neither the state of emergency nor the seventh modification interferes with or invalidates any existing family court order regarding custody or visitation. custody and visitation orders remain in full force and effect. travel  including interstate travel  for the purposes of complying with a family court order is considered essential travel and permitted. such travel was deemed essential in governor carney is fifth modification to the covid-19 state of emergency declaration issued march 22, 2020. under the seventh modification, such travel remains essential and is excluded from the selfquarantine requirement.    cnn indicates that some states have more vague language, however:    other states have left rulings vague. in massachusetts, for example, john d. casey, chief justice of probate and family court, last week issued an open letter that said,  both parents should cooperate.    some states are apparently encouraging  but not requiring  virtual visitation, such as vermont:    how is the department for children and families dealing with social distancing       according to johnson, dcf has called its families to ask if they would be willing to have virtual visitations.     that all said: you should consider the risks that visitation would bring. if your child, or anyone in either household, is in the  high risk  category, for example a child who is immunocompromised due to medication, or an elderly parent living at home with the family, it may be appropriate to limit or eliminate in person visitation. that would depend on an agreement between the two parents, though, to modify the arrangements temporarily  it would not be automatic.  it is highly recommended to have a conversation with your ex-partner, and be clear about your concerns and open to creative ideas. it may be safer to have fewer handoffs for longer periods of time - if it is normally 5 days / 2 days, then perhaps 3 weeks / 1 week is possible, for example, if the normally noncustodial parent is not working or is working at home and able to spend time with the child. the linked cnn article above has more recommendations along these lines.   facetime/skype/zoom/etc. are good options for maintaining contact with the child without personal contact. many activities can take place over videochat  reading a book to them, playing a board game virtually  one person moves pieces for the other player of course  or some games, like battleship, can be played completely remotely   online games, of course, as well.

  Post-viral anosmia is one of the leading causes of loss of sense of smell in adults, accounting for up to 40% cases of anosmia. Viruses that give rise to the common cold are well known to cause post-infectious loss, and over 200 different viruses are known to cause upper respiratory tract infections. Previously described coronaviruses are thought to account for 10-15% cases. It is therefore perhaps no surprise that the novel COVID-19 virus would also cause anosmia in infected patients.


But people are reporting anosmia as a presenting symptom.  What are the percentages here?
","this situation has not been fully characterised yet and has not been reported in the cases as a significant presentation before. but ent uk has issued the following advisory and hopes to stall the inappropriate use of steroids for anosmia    there is already good evidence from south korea, china and italy that significant numbers of patients with proven covid-19 infection have developed anosmia/hyposmia. in germany it is reported that more than 2 in 3 confirmed cases have anosmia. in south korea, where testing has been more widespread, 30  of patients testing positive have had anosmia as their major presenting symptom in otherwise mild cases.     in addition, there have been a rapidly growing number of reports of a significant increase in the number of patients presenting with anosmia in the absence of other symptoms - this has been widely shared on medical discussion boards by surgeons from all regions managing a high incidence of cases. iran has reported a sudden increase in cases of isolated anosmia, and many colleagues from the us, france and northern italy have the same experience. i have personally seen four patients this week, all under 40, and otherwise asymptomatic except for the recent onset of anosmia - i usually see roughly no more than one a month. i think these patients may be some of the hitherto hidden carriers that have facilitated the rapid spread of covid-19. unfortunately, these patients do not meet current criteria for testing or self-isolation.    while there is a chance the apparent increase in incidence could merely reflect the attention covid-19 has attracted in the media, and that such cases may be caused by typical rhinovirus and coronavirus strains, it could potentially be used as a screening tool to help identify otherwise asymptomatic patients, who could then be better instructed on self-isolation.    given the potential for covid-19 to present with anosmia, and the reports that corticosteroid use may increase the severity of infection, we would advise against use of oral steroids in the treatment of new onset anosmia during the pandemic, particularly if it is unrelated to head trauma or nasal pathology  such as nasal polyps .    there is potential that if any adult with anosmia but no other symptoms was asked to self-isolate for seven days, in addition to the current symptom criteria used to trigger quarantine, we might be able to reduce the number of otherwise asymptomatic individuals who continue to act as vectors, not realising the need to self-isolate. it will also be an important trigger for healthcare personnel to employ full ppe and help to counter the higher rates of infection found amongst ent surgeons compared to other healthcare workers.    http://www.entuk.org/loss-sense-smell-marker-covid-19-infection ",36

"I don't have any background in genetics and bioinformatics, so I ask you if you think that the arguments provided in the article The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2 by Andersen et al. are convincing. In particular:


  While the analyses above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may bind human ACE2 with high affinity, computational analyses predict that the interaction is not ideal and that the RBD sequence is different from those shown in SARS-CoV to be optimal for receptor binding. Thus, the high-affinity binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human ACE2 is most likely the result of natural selection...


I interpret this passage as ""if the virus had been engineered, they would have done a better job"". Is this interpretation correct? And if it is, does it sound convincing to you as a proof that the virus developed in nature?

The second motivation given in the article is the following:


  Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used


Again, do you think that this exclude the possibility of a human intervention in the creation of the virus?

Thank you for your opinions.

Edit: I am a fan of Occam razor, I know that the scenario in which the virus originated in the wild is by far more likely than the human engineered scenario. I just want to know if, given our current knowledge in genetics, would have been possible for some high skilled researchers to engineered COVID19 (without implying that they did this with any bad purpose)?

Edit 2: I share the concerns of the author of this post, that is, that the findings of the article are merely opinions and some of arguments are misleading. Anyone having a solid technical background can comment on this? China owns Nature magazine’s ass – Debunking “The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2” claiming COVID-19 definitely wasn’t from a lab
","in summary, the authors are saying the complete opposite of  human intervention .    while the analyses above suggest that sars-cov-2 may bind human ace2  with high affinity, computational analyses predict that the  interaction is not ideal and that the rbd sequence is different from  those shown in sars-cov to be optimal for receptor binding.   the interaction with ace2 is taking place on the spike protein  s  in both covid-19 and sars-cov. the s protein is very different between covid-19 and sars both in terms of sequence and covid-19 includes an additional furin cleavage site, meaning structurally it is quite distinct. the  computational analysis predicts  is difficult because there is no crystal structure for covid-19 s protein therefore modelling ligand binding is essentially guess work, particularly as it comprises an additional  furin  cleaved domain. what the authors appear to conclude is that they cannot map ace2-spike binding of covid-19 using an established sars s protein structure. i assume they are homology modelling sars-cov onto covid-19 s protein sequence data. in my personal opinion there is no way to homology model an additional furin protease cleavage site  furin is a host protease  so it would be difficult for  good fit  to occur, but it is just my opinion and the authors may have established methods to overcome this notable limitation, e.g. similar phenomena occur in influenza.     thus, the high-affinity binding of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to  human ace2 is most likely the result of natural selection..   their conclusion of  natural selection  is not strictly accurate and should be  darwinian positive selection , but its a small issue. what they are saying is darwinian adaptation has occurred as opposed to  purifying selection, i.e. conservation. thus they are definitely excluding human intervention because that is not  natural selection     furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the  several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would  probably have been used   they appear to be saying that if a synthetic virus was constructed it would be created using an established reverse genetics system, and all those produced to date look nothing like covid-19.  the phylogenetics argument is always a stronger argument than either of the above  although my opinion is not entirely objective . phylogeneticists have had a long history in opposing conspiracy theories, e.g. polio vaccination, hiv and the list goes on, so it is much more natural territory. an example of such an argument is here which  terdon helpfully pointed out.

","as already outlined in some of the comments, it is impossible to achieve what you want: you cannot control a computer to this extent without a severe invasion that would go far beyond anything that i would allow you to do on my computer due to privacy and security concerns. unless you want to video-monitor students, you can also not prevent students from using a second computer, a virtual machine, or having somebody else working on their computer for them. and even then you need at least two cameras to see everything that the student is doing or that is happening to them and you would have to frequently check that they are working themselves, did not rig the video, etc.  on a more general level, controlling cheating on any exam that is based on limiting resources is already difficult if you do it in a setting that you can control  i.e., your room, your computers, your toilets, etc. . by taking this battle to the  enemy is territory  and limiting your knowledge, you can only lose.  i would thus suggest the following alternative. this is how my programming practicals were done when i was a student. i also successfully applied this to a programming  exam  in a course i co-organised.   the students do the programming practical with no restrictions except time. for example, they may use the entire internet, course material, etc. after they submit the code, there is a short oral exam on the code. depending on the details of your course, you can very this exam in length and relevance, with the extreme examples being:   you grade the code and the oral exam only serves to ensure that the students did not cheat  and may be as short as five minutes . you only check that the code is doing what it is supposed to do, while the oral exam determines the grade and may also contain questions about other aspects of the course and deeper understanding. here, the oral exams may cost more time, but you also spend less time looking at their submissions.  if applicable, also perform plagiarism checks on the code.   some pros and cons of this approach:   you somehow have to organise remote oral exams, but these could be just via the phone, if that suffices to establish the examinee is identity for you. also be prepared that this mode will amplify anxiety, language, and other issues for some students  while it reduces them for others . you may need to modify your tasks to account for full internet access and similar, for example it should not be anything to which a bazillion of solutions exists. depending on your topic, this may be very difficult. the exam is more realistic: except for taking exams, your students will have internet access for the rest of their career and using it properly is also a relevant skill. the oral exam allows you to gauge actual understanding, whereas the purely written exam may be solved by rote-memorising algorithms, etc.  in case of group work, you do not need to worry much about some incompetent student benefiting from a stronger partner.  i am aware that this point does not apply to you  i mention it only for completeness.

"Let's say one country or a region could take action to contain the corona virus (eg: South Korea, Wuhan China). How could they remain protected while other countries or regions still have the virus? Do they have to stay isolated until no one in the world has the virus? Or if protection can only going to come through newly developed immunity by getting infected, does that mean every one in the world at some point has to get infected until a vaccine is invented?
","  does that mean every one in the world at some point has to get infected until a vaccine is invented    no. there are many infectous diseases which are only regional, or have been almost eradicated. countries free of  this or that  disease need to act quickly on imported cases, if the disease is highly infectuous.   on the other hand, if the spread of a pathogen in a  say closed  region is slowed down substantially, people who have developed immunity in this region will generally make the reproductive factor of the epidemic lower - and thus make it easier to contain its spread.   you may have a look at the last simulation in: http://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/ where the epidemic can in many cases self-extinguish itself by that effect.

"According to a NY Post article, parks in New York have become so overcrowded during this Covid-19 outbreak (supposedly because residents can't find anywhere else to go, e.g. restaurants are closed), so much so that some use cemeteries as parks in the hope of finding a less crowded spot. How accurate are these journalistic impressions? Is there data on the increase in overcrowding in NY parks during this outbreak, and if so, have there been any public health estimates on the danger that these park crowds may cause?

(I see that Cuomo was incensed by the crowded parks, but that was more than a week ago. He did close playgrounds, in the meantime.)

To those who think this can't be but BS (per comments below), governor Cuomo and mayor de Blasio have disagreed often enough, e.g. The Atlantic relates their disagreement on school closures:


  De Blasio angered New York parents and some of his own allies by resisting for days a decision to close schools, acting only following pressure from Cuomo and after a near-revolt by advisers and top public-health officials. “He’s both a bad decision maker and not good at communicating about it,” said an elected New York Democrat and former ally of the mayor’s, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve a working relationship with the de Blasio administration.


So I wouldn't be surprised they disagreed about parks too. The question whether the parks are crowded obviously has a public-health and thus a political dimension too nowadays (so I disagree with those who think this is off topic.)

And if you need anther source, the March 23 story was covered by Bloomberg too, with a March 20 image:




  Tired of being cooped up at home, hordes of New Yorkers headed to Central Park and other open spaces in the city over the weekend -- and that’s making Governor Andrew Cuomo very irritated.
  
  “It’s insensitive, it’s arrogant, it’s self-destructive, it’s disrespectful to other people, and it has to stop, and it has to stop now,” he said. “This is not a joke, and I am not kidding.”
  
  Calling the crowds “wholly inappropriate” amid a statewide stay-home order, he’s now asking the city to develop a plan that he can approve Monday to correct that.
  
  “We talk about social distancing,” he said. “I was in these parks, and you would not know that anything was going on.”


I don't know how [un]reliable ""The Gothamist"" is, but they posted these images supposedly from March 27:




Of course, a lot can change in a couple of weeks in people's attitudes, even if the parks are still open. And likewise some photos may be unrepresentative. The question is: did any behavioral change happen that made the closures unnecessary, or was Cuomo ranting like a madman and there was no problem to begin with? 
","i do not know about nyc, i live in nc. since our state and county governments began issuing stay at home orders, i have noticed an incredible number of people gathered in our parks - far more than what i would see on a typical day.  the entrances to our state parks were closed, but access to lakes is still available for boats. it has not been uncommon to drive by a lake access point and see hundreds of people tightly gathered by the loading ramps. trail-heads which on a great day would have 1 or 2 cars parked now have as many as 20 or 30. and i have never seen church parking lots so packed.  so, if nyc is anything like where i live, it would not be at all surprising to find community parks jammed.  from what we hear on a daily basis, we need to stay home except for essential requirements. we need to stay at least 6 feet from anyone not in our immediate family  as in those living under the same roof . and even more recently, we need to be wearing masks when out in public. we should not be hanging out with groups of more than 10 people  and that is not so much for viral safety, that is for social sanity . and like any virus, it makes no difference if it is passed indoors or out. the chance of infection remains the same either way. ",66
Are infected people able to transmit the virus to their pets and visa versa?,"no, there is no evidence that pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes covid-19, according to the who.  last month, the pet dog of a coronavirus patient in hong kong tested  weak  positive for covid-19 and was put in quarantine. scientists concluded that pet cats and dogs can test positive for low levels of the pathogen if they catch it from their owners, but pets can not get sick from the virus.",119
"Various governments seem to be playing whack-a-mole with travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines in the recent COVID-19 epidemic. First Chinese residents were banned from numerous countries. Afterwards travel bans expanded to South Korea, Japan, Iran and most recently Italy. Yet despite all the travel restrictions, the virus managed to successfully spread out all across the globe. 

So why continue with the practice of restricting foreign travel, especially when the virus has already been identified to be spreading at the local level? E.g. why doesn't the US remove travel restrictions on Chinese visitors, given that the virus has already been detected in numerous states?

Update: There are now 10 thousand official cases in the US, but travel restrictions are still in place for some reason.
","while it has clearly been shown by the virility of the virus so far that travel restrictions will not stop the inevitable community spread of the illness, and that their effectiveness as impeding the spread of the virus is small, the aim of the policy is no longer to stop the virus, but to delay it. this was confirmed as current policy in the uk is response to the virus by the chief medical officer, professor chris whitty, on march 5th.  there are a few reasons why this is the goal of many governments. firstly, if the peak of the pandemic can be delayed, this allows plans to be put in place for management of the crisis. for example, in the uk, plans have been floated that would allow final year medical students and trainee doctors to take on hospital duties during the nine week period that the virus is currently predicted to have the highest effect on the nhs, in order to mitigate the strain on the service.  secondly, delaying the spread of the virus allows time for a vaccine to be developed. while research on this is progressing quickly, it will still take time for the vaccine to pass clinical trials and be approved for human usage. in addition, as  patricia shanahan points out in the comments, the effectiveness of existing drugs already approved for treating similar respiratory diseases can be evaluated, which could be ready sooner than developing brand new drugs or a vaccine.  finally, as health services are acknowledged as being under the most strain during the winter months, the best time for the pandemic to peak would be in the middle of summer.  to this end, the policy of travel bans, while having been shown to be relatively ineffective at preventing the spread of the disease outright, is being used to delay the spread of the virus as much as possible, to allow national governments to prepare for the full impact of the peak of the predicted pandemic.

"I'm currently studying in the International Baccalaureate model. This high school model asks their students to do an individual work called the Internal Assessment. One of the subjects I study is chemistry, and my Chemistry Internal Assessment is based on the production of hydrogen (a source of energy) in the water electrolysis as a way to save electrical energy. I was going to do an experiment to measure the production of hydrogen in the electrolysis of water with various concentrations of four different solutes (NaCl, NaOH, sulphuric acid and sodium bicarbonate, but any electrolyte will do). However, with the Covid-19 outbreak, I cannot go to the laboratory, so in order to get the data I need, I searched on google databases with the information I wanted, but I found barely nothing. These links (https://www.scirp.org/pdf/NR_2013032814044640.pdf) (https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2017/se/c7se00334j) are the only useful pdfs I found, and I wonder if anyone could help me giving me some databases with the data I need.
","alejandro, you are right, the electrolytes will make a difference. the difference is not in terms of hydrogen production per se, as maurice mentions in the comments, it will be in terms of energy saving. electrolytic reactions are  exact  in the sense that if 100 electrons reach the electrode from a battery, 100 hydrogen ions will be reduced. in other words,  1 mole of electrons will reduce exactly 1 mole of a monovalent ion, 1/2 mole of a divalent, 1/3 mole of a trivalent ion and so on.  you would probably like to have an electrolyte which has the least electrical resistance. now you may recall that the proton in water    hydrogen ion  has the least electrical resistance known today. what comes next  hydroxide ions.  all you have to search and study is the conductivity of electrolytes at various concentrations.

"The next US census is scheduled for 2020-04-01. In light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic it might become necessary to delay this. How can this legally be done (since the census is required by the constitution)?
","the date of the census is not specified in the us constitution. it only says    the actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the congress of the united states, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct.   there is no requirement that  ten years  be interpreted precisely to the day. the date is fixed by statute at 13 usc 141 a :    the secretary shall, in the year 1980 and every 10 years thereafter, take a decennial census of population as of the first day of april of such year....   this requires that the census seek data describing the population on april 1, 2020. it does not require that census workers actually visit people on that day. they could conceivably do it in mid august, for example, or at any other time. of course, that would probably reduce the reliability of the census. congress could pass a law moving the census date to another later date if they wanted to get a more accurate count of the population on that date instead of a less accurate count of the population on the first of april.    in fact, when i got home later in the day after writing this answer, there was a letter from the census bureau inviting me to submit my census survey through the internet. i did that a few minutes ago, so if i die in the next two weeks, the census will be off by one.  the letter i got says that if i do not fill out the survey online, they will send me a paper questionnaire. if i do not fill that out, someone will come to visit. the prospect of that happening on april 1st seems quite remote.

"France held local elections even after coronavirus related restrictions had to be put in place. 

The article mentions only this rather general and vague reason for holding them:


  Macron decided to go ahead with the elections last week, saying it was
  vital the democratic system to continue functioning.


Clearly holding an elections means that lots of people are walking around and since the coronavirus spreads much easier that other viruses, it kind of defeats the purpose of existing restrictions.

Isn't it possible to delay elections in France?

Also, it is expected that voter turnout to be lower due to people being afraid of going out.

Question: Why did the French government organized elections as planned in spite of coronavirus restrictions?
","scientists advising the government told them that, with appropriate measures  such as soap everywhere,  1m distance between everyone, etc. , it was no more dangerous than going to buy some food, which is still authorized. the full scientific advice has not been published yet  it should be though , but here is the head of the scientific committee confirming it :    le conseil scientifique a considere qu il n y avait pas d element  pour penser qu il y aurait un surrisque pour ces personnes a condition  que les elections soient organisees de facon pratique    the scientific committee considered there was no element indicating  more risk  to go vote than to go shopping  for those people  elderly  people , if the elections are organized in a practical way.   there is also a question of politics and timing : on thursday morning all parties asked that it be maintained  in particular the right-wing senate president, who is now blamed for it , so they had to decide that.  however, later the same day, the confinement measures were decided, which seemed to contradict the possibility to vote. but politically it was too late, cancelling the elections would go against advice given by all parties on thursday morning.  since macron was expected to lose the elections  which he mostly did , cancelling the election after every other party expressed against it would have been seen as an antidemocratic political maneuver.  some of the opposition parties have since then declared that they only accepted to maintain the elections before the confinement measures were decided, and thus that they could not decide in all knowledge, and would have changed their minds after the confinement measures were announced.

","it is hard to know exactly what another person is thinking, but merkel is probably referencing herd immunity.  assuming that people who are infected and recover will be less susceptible to infection in the future  the extent to which is currently unknown , those people have effectively been naturally vaccinated, which can help slow down future spread.

"Can coronaviruses mutate to an extent to get as dangerous as fliovirusues such as Marburg viruses, Ravn or Ebola Zaire? 
"," wouldangerous  is quite a subjective term, and can be defined in different ways.  viruses vary in their pathogenicity, which is essentially the ability of the virus to cause a disease in a single individual. this can influence other factors, such as the case fatality rate, which is the proportion of people who die from the disease once they have contracted it. for example, the ebola virus has a very high case fatality rate of up to 90 .  however, those are not the only ways in which you could define wouldangerous . we might also consider the total number of people that the virus can kill. this often is not a linear relationship with the case fatality rate. often, viruses with a high case fatality rate  burn out  before than can inflict a global pandemic, because people die before they can spread the disease on to others. vice versa, viruses with a relatively low case fatality rate, such as the spanish flu  2-3   can be extremely wouldangerous  and kill millions of people.   but there is no hard and fast rule, as the propensity of a virus to cause a global pandemic is influenced by many, many other factors.   so to answer your question: is it possible for the covid-19 to mutate into something as dangerous as ebola  well, if we are thinking about it is pathogenicity - influenza a h5n1  bird flu  had a case fatality rate of about 60 , which is pretty high for a flu virus. for context, the seasonal flu which has a case fatality rate of about 0.1 . i am not an expert in virology, so it would be great if someone with more knowledge could confirm this, but it seems very unlikely that the covid-19 virus could acquire mutations to the degree where it would kill as high as 90  of the people who acquire it, like ebola does. ebola is a hemorrhagic virus, which is a totally different mechanism of pathogenicity to the coronavirus family.   it is plausible that covid-19 could obtain mutations which allow it to transfer more quickly between humans. for example, we know that the spanish flu acquired mutations in hemagglutinin subtype which allowed it to be more transmissible between humans. generally, coronaviruses have relatively lower r0 rates than other disease   2/3 compared to measles which is 12-18 . the total number of people killed by the ebola outbreak was about 11,000. covid-19 has already killed  3000  although the exact figure is hard to quantify , so it seems like on the global level, covid-19 will be more dangerous than ebola, if we consider the total number of people killed.

","i live in guangdong, and this is what i have been seeing  amp  reading about.  wuhan  city in hubei  is where the outbreak supposedly began. and it went unnoticed for a while, which mean it was spreading locally more-so than it was spreading nationally/internationally. near at the start of the chinese new year holiday, the government decided to quarantine all of hubei province. so while other provinces already had infected people, they spread had not grown as significantly as it had in hubei yet.  the chinese government then decided to take specific measures to control the epidemic. for starters, they required mask-wearing and encouraged staying indoors. they also began to set up body temperature checks all over the place  apartments, neighborhoods, roads leading into cities, and places of work once the holiday ended. fever seems to be the first symptom, so this is why .  if anyone in an apartment building was confirmed to have the virus, then the entire building and all residents were/are quarantined for 14 days  happened to a 30  story apartment building next to mine . elevators, doors, and other public spaces are often disinfected, particularly if a suspected case had been in the area. again, i saw this at a temperature checkpoint, someone must have had a fever and a little bit later some folks came and sprayed down the area.  schools are also closed in all provinces across the country, and students are doing online schooling. some companies are also allowing employees to work from home, or istaggering  their work days  half come in into the office on mon, wed, fri, the other half come in tuesday and thursday . this decreases the number of people a possible infected person can pass the virus to.  on top of this, companies needed to  apply  to be able to resume work. here in shenzhen, nobody could return to work within 14 days of returning from the city, assuming they left during the holiday. we also need to record down our body temp when coming to and leaving from work. according to an sms i received from the local government, if 2 employees have a body temperature    37.3c, then it needs to be reported immediately, as it indicates a possible spread in that workplace.  in short, the virus was able to take a foothold in hubei, and it was noticed before it took a significant foothold in other provinces. therefore other provinces had time to implement proactive and preventative measures, before the situation grew to hubei-level of significance.  the best way to prevent it from spreading is simple steps, such as not going outside unless its necessary, avoid close contact with others  defined as within 6 feet for an extended period of time , washing your hands, and disinfecting often-touched surfaces like door knobs, keyboards, cell phones, etc. it remains to be seen whether other countries will take the same rather drastic measures that are being taken in china, i suppose it all depends on how bad things get in other countries.

"On March 3rd, the UK government released a publication detailing its Coronavirus action plan, which contains the four-stage plan that will be implemented throughout the country, in all four devolved nations, as the impact of the disease continues to worsen. Below is a brief summary of each stage:


Contain - identify cases as soon as possible, and attempt to prevent wider community spread of the virus. Powers have been given to enforce quarantines and extra funding granted to healthcare centres. The goal is to stop the virus from taking hold in the country.
Delay - if containment does not work, measures such as closing schools, banning large gatherings, and incentivising working from home will be introduced. The goal is to delay the inevitable spread of the virus for as long as possible.
Research - if measures taken to delay the virus prove ineffective, focus efforts on researching how to best fight the virus; working out how it spreads, and the best treatment methods. This includes research into vaccine development and deployment.
Mitigate - the last resort scenario, at this point the government will focus on keeping essential services such as police/fire/ambulance functional, as well as bringing retired and newly graduated doctors to the frontlines.


At the moment, the UK Government insists that the country is still in the containment phase, despite the country's Chief Medical Officer and the government's chief medical advisor, Prof. Chris Whitty telling MPs as early as March 5th that the UK ""was now ""mainly"" in the delay phase"".

At first glance the government's refusal to move to the delay phase, despite 460 total cases, and confirmed community spread, seems stubborn and almost deluded, however, the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport, Jeane Freeman told MSPs after attending a COBRA meeting on the 10th that 


  The timing of moving into the ‘delay’ phase, and what measures are
  judged to be the most effective in that phase, must be and are driven
  very firmly by scientific and clinical advice. Understandably people
  will be looking to the situation in other countries and questioning
  why some of the moves they are taking are not being made here yet in
  Scotland and in the UK.
  
  [...]
  
  Timing is critical. If we take those measures too soon, we will not
  have the impact we need. If we take them too late, we will not reduce
  demand [on the NHS] to the level we need


What is the risk behind taking these measures - i.e. moving into the delay phase - too soon? I note that Poland, for example, which has a fraction of the cases of the UK, will close all museums, cinemas, &amp; schools from Monday. Why might this be a mistake? Is there any research that has evaluated this?

(Note that although the example I have given is UK-based, I am also interested in answers that refer to the general postponement of more extreme countermeasures internationally)
","specifically with reference to the uk, an article in the guardian reports that     experts have warned about the risk that if tough measures are taken too soon,  fatigue  may set in, prompting the public to disregard the advice just as the virus reaches its peak.   effectively the argument is that, absent some sort of enforcement squad if people are told to stay in lockdown for a significant period, without a significant scare factor to justify it, then people will assume the risk is actually overblown and start mingling again, just at the moment that many of them are at their most contagious, starting a whole new outbreak in the herd of uninfected.

"I heard that the U.K. was talking about using a ""herd immunity"" approach to the coronavirus. What exactly is herd immunity, and could it work against coronavirus?","last week, the u.k. government signaled that it might be considering a different approach to coronavirus control than the rest of the world -- in essence, allowing a large percentage of the population to become infected in order to develop a  herd immunity  that would eventually end the epidemic. herd immunity occurs when enough people in a population are immune to disease -- either because they have been infected and recovered or they have been vaccinated against it. the idea is that the pool of people who can catch the disease has been reduced, reducing the risk to the so-far unaffected. sir patrick vallance, the u.k. government is chief scientific adviser, said that about 60  of the population would need to get the coronavirus in order to get a herd immunity effect. but using such an approach would raise a big question: during that spread, how do you protect the most vulnerable groups - the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions  herd immunity works with contagious diseases like measles, for which a vaccine exists. but the idea that the u.k. would not immediately work to suppress the number of cases, especially as there are no approved treatments for covid-19 yet and the disease has killed thousands in italy, stirred an immediate public backlash. the government quickly backtracked, and on friday, prime minister boris johnson said all restaurants, pubs and gyms would close for the foreseeable future to reduce transmission. and there is no certainty that herd immunity would even work for coronavirus. that approach  assumes that people being infected are immune and cannot get re-infected. and we do not know that as of yet,  says albert ko, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the yale school of public health. people who go outside to exercise are sometimes shamed on tv and on social media for risky behavior. is it okay to go outside for a walk, run or bike ride  the white house coronavirus guidelines for the 15-day period that started monday advise avoiding  discretionary travel, shopping trips and social visits,  as well as  social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people.  but outdoor exercise is not on the list. so unless local guidelines instruct otherwise, fresh air and outdoor exercise are allowed - though it is important to keep some distance between yourself and others. the coronavirus is thought to spread primarily through close contact between people - within about six feet. the primary mode of transmission is through respiratory droplets. there is better airflow outside than in confined spaces. that air flow outside reduces the risk of one person transmitting the virus to another through droplets in the air, says albert ko, the yale epidemiologist.  so if you are going out and you are hiking or biking or running and you are not within, say, six feet or 10 feet of another person, i would consider that a healthy, safe practice.  ko also points to the significant mental health issues that can be caused or exacerbated when people are cooped up.  my personal feeling is that if people are practicing sound respiratory hygiene, sound hand hygiene, they are distancing themselves physically from others outside, and you are exercising and walking in the park -- i think that is actually a good public health practice.

"Most signs show that lockdown could easily stretch through the summer. A freeze in consumer spending would cause multiple industries to fail causing a ripple effect.

To be specific, if lockdown lasts through the summer, and a second virus wave occurs in the fall as expected, then lockdowns will continue further into the year. The timeframe for a vaccine is 12-18 months earliest. Then, the vaccine must be manufactured and distributed. Since the virus is so widespread that it is now assumed that it will reach a global critical mass, this essentially guarantees the collapse of the restaurant, airline, tourism, and hotel industries as they cannot sustain prolonged losses in a capitalistic structure. If they fail, their suppliers fail, and so on. History has shown that large systems are prone to failure time and time again, esp. when accountability is obfuscated (e.g. the Titanic, the World Wars/Holocaust, and now this). In the past Egypt fell, and then Rome fell. What is to say our current systems won’t fail, even if as a slowly sinking ship?

EDIT: This question was closed, before I received enough good, thoughtful answers. As of tonight (April 4th) Bernie Sanders held a virtual address on the situation. He's looking at the unemployment projections that were posted by the St. Louis Fed's models and has spoken with a number of economists. Finally a voice of reason in this media circus. He has confirmed that a potential collapse is possible as another 47 million Americans may become jobless - this is unprecedented and would be absolutely devastating to American civilization.
","as a disclaimer, this is not an answer, rather a long-form explanation of the difficulties of answering.  the first leg is uncertainty about the danger of the epidemic. economists are not medical experts. for example, one could imagine that there is an amazing breakthrough where a common medicine saves patients. the economic effects of that scenario are very different than the scenarios presented by governments. more realistically, we do not know how strong activity restrictions have to be to control the epidemic.  the next leg of uncertainty is the government response. governments have the capacity to bail out entities  firms, households  that get in trouble. we do not know what they will do.  even if we knew all that, there is uncertainty about the best model that takes all this in. it is very unusual for governments to restrict economic activity in such a broad-based manner, and so there are no standard models.  there is a flood of research.   finally,  conventional  economics does not really spend much time looking into societal collapse scenarios. there are areas of academia that do this, and there is presumably studies in economic history. experts in those subject areas are not normally visiting this website.

So how do I stay safe while exercising in COVID-19?,"do not exercise if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing. stay home and rest, seek medical attention and call in advance. follow the directions of your local health authority.if you are able to go for a walk or bicycle ride always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home. if water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. if you go to a park or public open space to walk, run or exercise always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap, before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home. if water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. follow the directions of your local health authority in regards to any restrictions on the number of people with you and/or restrictions on the use of public outdoor play or exercise equipment. if you are not regularly active start slowly and with low intensity activities, like walking and low impact exercises. start with shorter amounts, like 5-10 minutes, and gradually build up to 30 minutes or more continuously over a few weeks. it is better and safer to be active for short periods more frequently than to try and be active for long periods when you are not used to it. choose the right activity so that you reduce the risk of injury and that you enjoy the activity. choose the right intensity according to your health status and fitness level. you should be able to breath comfortably and hold a conversation while you do light- and moderate-intensity physical activity.",64

"I am planning to rent an apartment for a year in Cambridge, UK. We liked a property, but the owner wants to rent it through booking.com, and he is physically located in Switzerland. He sent us the following email.


  Hi ****,
  
  I am sure you are aware of the current virus pandemic spread
  worldwide; all doctors here in Switzerland are now the 1st line of
  defense in the race to control the spread of the virus. Since I'm
  working over 16 hours/day to help my colleagues to fight this pandemic
  and as well it's not recommended to get a flight these days, a viewing
  before completing the transaction through Booking.com would not be
  possible.
  
  Also a video tour of the property is available if you would like to
  check it out: URL 
      Allow me to explain the Booking.com process step by step.
  
  
  Upon your request, I will list the property online on Booking.com for GBP 1,100 / month with all the bills included.
  I will send you the booking invitation through the Booking.com system so you will have 24 hours to confirm it or the invitation will
  expire.
  Once you receive the booking invitation from Booking.com, you will have to choose your check-in date ( this would be the date that you
  would prefer to move in ) &amp; staying period ( minimum one month and
  maximum five years )
  After registration, you will have to pay £ 2,200 to Booking.com to get your reservation confirmed. The payment of £ 2,200 would be used
  as a 1 (one) month of rent + 1 (one) month security deposit. You can
  use it as the last month of rent or take it back at the end of your
  stay.
  Booking.com will automatically provide the tenancy agreement. Booking.com's policy allows maximum 1-month bookings, but choosing a
  more extended period will enable you to have the contract for it and
  receive the invoice each month during the selected period.
  Your deposit will be held by Booking.com in their system until your check-in, after which will be put in a DPS as per law.
  After Booking.com confirms your payment of £ 2,200 Keycafe ( https://keycafe.com ) will provide you the location of the keys since
  it is their main partner in these transactions. If you don't like the
  property for any reason, Booking will refund your money on the same
  day. If, after the viewing, you decide to rent it, you will have to
  sign the tenancy agreement and forward it to me by fax or email.
  
  Let me know when would be the best time for you to list the property
  online on Booking.com and forward you the listing.
  


Is this a genuine method to rent properties in a different country through booking.com, or is it part of an elaborate scam?
","this is 100  to be a scam. let is see why:   a viewing before completing the transaction through booking.com would not be possible.  lt   this is where you should run screaming and not read anything else. even if the place exists, how would you know it is not a mold infested, badly insulated garbage heap  if they wanted to do a real long term rent through an app they would use airbnb which allows for this and not booking.com which does not. it is a huge red flag they want to use a platform not suited for long term.  i will send you the booking invitation through the booking.com system  lt   once again, airbnb has this but even there only after enquiring after a property, booking.com very simply does not have such a feature. this person is talking nonsense, we will see why. booking.com will automatically provide the tenancy agreement.  lt   the very reason booking.com stops at 30 days is because in a lot of jurisdictions 30 days is where a short term becomes a tenancy and booking.com does not want to mess with tenancy agreements. booking.com most assuredly will not provide a tenancy agreement  i have first booked an apartment with booking.com close to five years ago and there is nothing even remotely close to a tenancy agreement in all those emails, i reviewed a few again. if you do not like the property for any reason, booking will refund your money on the same day.  lt   booking.com does not exactly work like that. as this blog post shows, the host sets the cancellation policy and up until very very recently the scammer was able to siphon the funds off as soon as the reservation becomes 90  non-refundable, otherwise on the guest is check-in date. see for example here. right now, because of the covid-19 situation, they can only get their money one day past check in per this update but i somewhat suspect they are not 100  up-to-date. also, do you want to convince booking.com that the apartment simply does not exist within less than 24 hour before your money is gone  if booking.com does not side with you then your only avenue is to sue them in a dutch court of law.   finally, if i needed to make a grim bet, i would put my money on this being nothing more than bait-and-switch and they do not want to use booking.com: you agree to this, and after some hemming and hawing and probably a few juicy photos they come back complaining about some problems with booking.com listing and ask for a plain vanilla wu wire. by this time you are hopefully hooked enough to go ahead with it, if not, what is there to lose for them  you can even test it by agreeing and see what happens, just do not send money to them...   and if you are wondering how people rent long term in a different country: they might have boots on the ground  company or friend  and if they do not then just do a short term rent much like it would be a vacation and get a place once you are there. easy as pie. i did so when i landed in vancouver.

"My university, like many others, has recently moved to remote teaching in response to the corona virus situation. In my department, the faculty have taken the lead on finding and adopting solutions to the difficulties posed by the transition. I am a postdoc and not directly involved in a lot of the big changes. But I wonder if the faculty are sealing their fate, being so helpful when there is a counterparty, the administration, that may not have the faculty's best interests at heart (note, I have no direct knowledge either way). 

Specifically, barring any big disasters in remote teaching these next weeks/months, I would guess 1) smaller schools close to insolvency, many of which have closed these last few years, would instead have an opportunity to cut costs by dispensing with or heavily decreasing in-person instruction, without facing the PR issues or other pushback that would otherwise bring, and 2) even in schools with secure finances, or where it is unrealistic to get rid of in-person instruction, professors would lose a lot of bargaining power in any negotiations with the administration, since they will be regarded as that much less necessarily. Possibly the next few weeks/months will demonstrate that the professors are in fact less necessary, and remote learning is perhaps preferable. I am not really asking about that, my question is more selfish as someone going on the job market soon. Are these outcomes likely? This type of concern must be on the radar of professors' unions, no?
","well, based on the 3 institutions i have close contact with, their attempts in the past few weeks hardly represent a shining example of hugely successful online learning  it feels more like the keystone kops   that bit of snark out of the way, effective teaching in the online/mooc/e-channel, etc. is not easy, and making the transition between a face to face course and an effective online course requires a lot of thought and a lot of design a prep, which of course no-one has has time to do this time around. so my snark was not meant as a true criticism, but at the same time, it means that mainstream universities  efforts in the balance of this semester are themselves unlikely to make anyone -- teachers or learners -- say,  hey, that went really well  let is dispense with classroom instruction altogether .  that being said, i do think this will strongly accelerate the shift towards e-learning in the medium- and long-term, and that in 2 ways.   in the long term, this will make e-learning a much more mainstream offering that students and faculty will become more comfortable exploring and integrating into the curriculum. forced immersion brings familiarity and less fear. up to now, in north america at least, we tended to have old-school in-person institutions, a few more e-learning focused disruptor institutions, and a select few dabbling in moocs layered on top of their usual approach. there was a lot of mutual mistrust. that will lessen. and just like a greater degree of teleworking throughout the economy, with the pandora is box on it opened, will persist past current social isolation, so will demand for -- and willingness of faculty to explore -- e-learning. next year, there will be a lot of financially and emotionally wounded students, whose life plan took a pretty big hit. some will be keen and able to return to their university campuses and continue as before. some will not be, and when they get their affairs in order a few years later, in a world that will have lived through months of forced virtual work and socialization, they will probably be keener to explore online offerings than they were previously. and the more they start work somewhere and become mature learners, or the more straitened their financial circumstances become, the more they will seek out good-value-for-money education with schedule and geographic flexibility, and the less they will be keen to return and pay for the conventional on-campus student experience. of course that will not apply to all, but i suspect to enough that it will make a difference at the macro level.

It can be useful in situations where the probability of catching the virus in the long run is very high. For example one may prefer to infect the eye and protect the other routes (if possible).

Questions


Can cats/dogs/hamsters or other pets catch the cold? 
How quickly do they recover?

","yes they can. the viruses that cause a cold include rhinoviruses  up to 80  , coronaviruses and influenza  together accounting for much of the remaining 20   and a small percentage of adenoviruses. when discussing cross species transfer, influenza is the most important to discuss as it is a fairly common cause of the  common cold .   influenza a has humans, pigs, bird and horses as its host. different influenza strains have different hosts. influenza can recombine if two strains infect the same host  antigenic shift  and also mutate  antigenic drift . with a combination of these influenza can and has numerous times crossed the species barrier which has caused the major flu pandemics as well as swine and avian flu. it is this reservoir that makes these viruses so hard to eradicate. when we are the only host such as in polio virus, it is a lot easier. pigs do not adhere to national flu guidelines.   comparing recovery times, all mammals are roughly similar although due to our slightly more evolved immune system as well as social factors of knowing what to do when we are ill we recovery very slightly earlier.

Is it safe to bake a friend cake for her birthday send it to her? - Samantha,"it is hard to not be able to see our friends and family in person, especially on special occasions, so sending a gift shows we are thinking of them. there is no evidence of covid-19 being transmitted through food, and thorough cooking will kill the virus. the uk food standards agency website has advice on food safety. if you are not displaying coronavirus symptoms, make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before you start baking. if you are showing symptoms of the virus - or have been in contact with someone who has - then it is probably not a good idea to prepare food for somebody else. that is because coronavirus spreads through small droplets - packed with the virus - expelled by a sufferer if they cough or sneeze. these can cause an infection if they are breathed in, or if someone touches a surface on which they have landed. while the chance of contracting coronavirus through food delivery is low, it does exist. the tin or box the cake is placed in probably presents a higher risk than the cake itself, so your friend should rinse the packaging when she receives the cake. if you are dropping the cake off yourself, you should maintain social distancing by ensuring you stay 2m  6ft  apart from each other.",125
"In forest management, a controlled burn is “used for hazard reduction [to] decrease the likelihood of serious hotter fires” [W]. In backfiring strategy, “firefighters attempt to halt the advance of a wildfire (…) by burning up fuel in its path” [H].

Could the same strategy be used to fight the Coronavirus?

E.g. in my native country (Norway), most hotels are now closed. If, for the sake of the argument, we assume that 1) humans become immune after having fallen sick to the virus and 2) people under 25 do not become seriously ill, what is the counterargument to inviting people in the age group 15-25 to mass isolate in said hotels for e.g. 1 month, for the purpose of kickstarting herd immunity?

Can you get COVID-19 more than once?,"the short answer: we do not know yet. it is not yet clear whether people can be reinfected by this coronavirus or how long immunity might last after infection. immunity after recovery from covid-19 would be a boon in the global fight to rein in the virus. people who have recovered and gained immunity would be especially valuable as health care workers. the spread of the virus would slow if more people had immunity to it. and antibodies from recovered people could help in developing a treatment for the disease. as npr is nell greenfieldboyce has reported, scientists are looking for clues about immunity to and reinfection from other coronaviruses. the severe coronaviruses sars and mers did produce antibodies in those who had the virus. in the case of mers, survivors generated an immune response to the virus that could be detected up to two years later. and the sicker the patient was, the more long lasting their immune response. but in the case of the four seasonal coronaviruses that are a cause of the common cold, they can sicken people over and over again. after infection with one of these viruses, antibodies are produced -- but then the levels slowly decline and people become susceptible again. there are some indications that the new coronavirus, officially known as sars-cov-2, can spur immunity. new not-yet-peer-reviewed research in rhesus macaques found that the new coronavirus does not cause reinfections.  i think there is a very likely scenario where the virus comes through this year, and everyone gets some level of immunity to it, and if it comes back again, we will be protected from it,  matt frieman, a coronavirus researcher at the university of maryland school of medicine in baltimore, told npr.  either completely or if you do get reinfected later, a year from now, then you have much less disease.   that is the hope,  he adds.  but there is no way to know that.

"Several counties in California have issued a shelter in place order due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For example, see a Santa Clara’s order here.

The order states that individuals have to shelter in place. However, it lists multiple exceptions.

This seems to be in violation of the concept that exercising your rights does not give grounds for reasonable suspicion or probable cause. Does an officer need probably cause that you are in violation of the order to arrest you?

"Somewhat controversially, China has had temporarily relocated those infected with Covid-19 in the Wuhan area to so-called Fangcang hospitals, large communal areas transformed into make-shift hospitals. Although there were up to 13 Fangcang hospitals opened at one point in Wuhan, these were apparently all closed by March 10.


  Fangcang shelter hospitals may seem similar to the makeshift and emergency field hospitals used during previous epidemics in other countries, for example, in the USA during the 1918–19 influenza pandemic, or in African countries during the 2014–15 Ebola epidemic. However, they differ in several important ways. First, the Fangcang shelter hospitals in China were established to isolate the patients who were most likely to transmit the infection because they had only mild to moderate COVID-19 and were thus likely to be active in their daily lives and in contact with family and community members. Second, the Fangcang shelter hospitals served an important triage function, separating patients by severity of symptoms, which was not a focus of previous makeshift and emergency field hospitals. [...]


These Fangcang hospitals should not be confused with the other kind of emergency hospitals that China had built earlier, for those more seriously sick with Covid-19, such as the Huoshenshan Hospital. (The latter was a prefab hospital with separate rooms.)

I've heard that some countries are already considering converting open-space structures to some kind of emergency/extra hospitals, e.g. as seen in this US footage. While the open-space conversion resembles more a Fangcang than the other type of prefab Chinese hospital, what do know about plans to mass-quarantine the mild cases in such open-space-conversion hospitals elsewhere, i.e. do (any of) these resemble Fangcangs in (intended) function, not just in looks?
","yes, several countries are planning to implement this approach, and in some cases, already have. on march 12th, the european centre for disease prevention and control  ecdc , an eu agency, updated its rapid risk assessment on the covid-19 pandemic, in which it advises states to     designate treatment facilities both for mild and for severe covid-19 cases with critical care capabilities  e.g. ecmo . this  implies activation of hospital plans to the highest level to be able to cancel elective diagnostic and operative procedures and  re-assign human resources, creating temporary treatment facilities for the mild cases or advising self-isolation until  symptoms improve or worsen.   the who also released guidance to this effect on march 17th, reiterating that     who recommends that all laboratory confirmed cases be isolated and  cared for in a health care facility.     ...     if all mild cases cannot be isolated in health facilities, then those  with mild illness and no risk factors may need to be isolated in  non-traditional facilities, such as repurposed hotels, stadiums or  gymnasiums where they can remain until their symptoms resolve and  laboratory tests for covid-19 virus are negative.   in madrid, this advice was implemented with a temporary hospital set up in the ifema conference centre. the first patients arrived at the facility on march 21st, and initially had a capacity for 200 patients with amild  cases of covid-19. capacity will eventually be extended to 1300 beds, with a small number of icu units in case these mild cases progress to severe cases.  hotel via castellana has also been converted  article in spanish  to a temporary hospital for mild cases, with six of the hospital is floors converted to facilities for the lightly ill, and a seventh converted to house medical staff.  in south korea, this strategy has also been used - the wsj reports that in order to solve the issue of hospital overcrowding:    south korea divided confirmed patients into four categories. only the  sickest and elderly went to hospitals. the young and asymptomatic went  to dormitories, which were lent by samsung life insurance co., lg  display co. and others, equipped with little more than beds, wi-fi and  the occasional television.    the decision ensured that low-risk individuals remained quarantined  under government watch. thousands of south korea is virus patients have  ridden out the past several weeks living in buildings where companies  typically put up workers for off-site, multiday training.   in the phillipines,  emergency quarantine facilities   eqfs  are being planned, temporary centres designed for  patients who are waiting for test results or have mild symptoms but are not in dire straits -- a way to keep potentially infected people separate from their communities.   many countries, however, have chosen not to adopt this strategy, instead advising those with mild to moderate symptoms to self-isolate, prioritising hospital beds, including field hospital beds, for those most at risk or with the worst symptoms. in singapore, the country had enough hospital capacity to deal with all patients, including those with mild symptoms, due in part to the amount of testing and contact tracing which was used to isolate and quarantine cases.

"CONTEXT

While no government wants there to be a pandemic, and would certainly prefer (hope) for it to just go away, they can only downplay it for a short time before it overwhelms the population and they must address it from a significantly weaker position than if they had acted decisively at the beginning.

In the smartphone era, information propagates instantly through informal networks (Facebook, WeChat, StackExchange, etc.) and is difficult to suppress.

QUESTIONS

After witnessing the COVID epidemic and failure to contain it in Asia, it spread to Europe and was poised to infect the west. Why did western hemisphere leaders downplay the pandemic’s threat instead of acknowledging the problem and communicating what would be done to reverse the issue?  What is the political incentive for deferring acknowledgement and action?
","in hindsight it is clear that many governments should have taken the risk of a covid19 pandemic much more seriously, but it is not that easy to anticipate the reach and intensity of the epidemic before it happens. there have been other serious threats before for which the containment strategy proved sufficient, and if a government allocates resources  for instance massive purchases of masks and ventilators  which end up wasted they are going to be criticized as well.   this article in the guardian argues that most european countries were not as well prepared as some asian countries because:   there was no recent experience of a serious epidemic in the country, causing leaders to subconsciously underestimate the seriousness of the threat. there is a potential political cost for a government if they invest resources by precaution and the risk does not materialize:     the challenge faced by government is whether and when to act on a health threat. if you act swiftly and the outbreak is not as bad as  feared, then government gets criticised for overreacting. if you  adopt a wait-and-see approach and move too slowly, then government  gets criticised for underreacting,  says steve taylor, professor at  the university of british columbia and author of the psychology of  pandemics.   as an example, during the 2009 h1n1 flu pandemic roselyne bachelot was minister of health in the french government. she purchased 94 million vaccines, but only a small proportion turned out to be actually used. as a result she was widely criticized for wasting public money. i assume that there are other examples of this kind, where a politician loses some political points because they made a safe but costly decision.   it seems that when an epidemic threat presents itself a government must make a call between:   taking the threat seriously and therefore mobilizing important resources for an overall unlikely epidemic crisis, with a high risk to appear as overreacting and wasting public money. taking minimal conservative measures, which is unlikely to be sufficient if the crisis materializes. however this will likely appear as the  normal  choice to make, since nobody could objectively have anticipated the intensity of the crisis.   note: this answer is made of recycled material from a closed question of mine.

The finding of 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV, all of which have identity/similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature.

I know this is a preprint paper and it's not yet peer reviewed, but can someone tell me what the implications are if this is true? Does this mean that the virus is artificially constructed?
","  update: the article has now been withdrawn with the following note:    this paper has been withdrawn by its authors. they intend to revise it  in response to comments received from the research community on their  technical approach and their interpretation of the results. if you  have any questions, please contact the corresponding author.     this is very odd, and will require a rigorous investigation, but my initial reaction is one of scepticism. considering just the 1st insert, the insert sequence is gtngtkr, short at just 7 amino acids. a simple blastp vs nr did not find perfect matches to hiv sequences, but did reveal 100  identity across the full sequence length to  50 other short protein sequences, which could be spurious  chance  hits of course. many of the top 100 hits are against eukaryotic sequences, for example one is against pristionchus pacificus, a type of nematode worm  see alignment below . someone needs to do a proper peer review of this preprint before any conclusions are drawn from it.   gt tank-1  pristionchus pacificus  sequence id: pdm74036.1 length: 2481  range 1: 1474 to 1480  score:24.0 bits 49 , expect:2477,  method:,  identities:7/7 100  , positives:7/7 100  , gaps:0/7 0    query 1 gtngtkr 7  gtngtkr sbjct 1474 gtngtkr 1480     update 1: things are moving fast. there are now 10 comments under the preprint, all of them critical of the idea that these inserts are meaningfully similar to hiv-1 sequences for the reason i outlined above  i.e. short sequences with many hits against organisms from across the tree of life  and additional points, such as small insertions being quite normal evolution for rna viruses. there are also similar critiques on twitter and biorxiv has added the following disclaimer header to their website:    biorxiv is receiving many new papers on coronavirus 2019-ncov. a  reminder: these are preliminary reports that have not been  peer-reviewed. they should not be regarded as conclusive, guide  clinical practice/health-related behavior, or be reported in news  media as established information.   i have never seen such rapid  and unanimous  post-publication peer review before. it is therefore already  just 1 day after publication  fairly clear that at least some claims in this study are completely false and there is no good evidence to support the claim that the 2019-ncov have acquired sequences from hiv or evidence to suggest the virus is engineered.

"On March 27th, President Trump signed the COVID-19 stimulus bill, the CARES Act, into law. This came after days of debate, where Democratic lawmakers insisted on the inclusion of oversight measures before they would agree to pass the bill. A few hours after signing the act into law, the White House released a signing statement, where the President takes issue with several provisions in the bill, and states his administration's intent to treat some of these provisions as advisory or hortatory. 

Of particular interest is the following paragraph:


  Section 4018 of Division A of the Act establishes a new Special
  Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR) within the Department
  of the Treasury to manage audits and investigations of loans and
  investments made by the Secretary of the Treasury under the Act. 
  Section 4018(e)(4)(B) of the Act authorizes the SIGPR to request
  information from other government agencies and requires the SIGPR to
  report to the Congress “without delay” any refusal of such a request
  that “in the judgment of the Special Inspector General” is
  unreasonable.  I do not understand, and my Administration will not
  treat, this provision as permitting the SIGPR to issue reports to the
  Congress without the presidential supervision required by the Take
  Care Clause, Article II, section 3.


This implies that the new position of Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR) will be unable to perform their duties, as the President apparently reserves the right to supervise, and potentially suppress, any reports that the Special Inspector will attempt to make to Congress.

Is the President able to effectively nullify these provisions of the bill unilaterally, or does this signing statement have no legal weight until tested in the courts? Are any oversight mechanisms aside from this Special Investigator available to Congress?
","signing statements do not have the force of law. most often signing statements are used to signify how the president will interpret and enforce the law    for example, in president obama is signing statement for the  national defense authorization act , he explained a few reasons why he chose to sign the bill  it authorizes funding for important national defense programs, etc. , then went on to point out a few sections of the bill that he viewed as unconstitutional. he then stated,  my administration will interpret them  some of the disputed sections  to avoid the constitutional conflict.    in other words, signing statements are often just a different way to enact an executive order.  going back to this bill, the relevant portion would be    i do not understand, and my administration will not treat, this provision as permitting the sigpr to issue reports to the congress without the presidential supervision required by the take care clause, article ii, section 3.   this does not nullify the law, it simply says the sigpr should not report to congress without reporting to the president first. this does provide trump with a preview of any report and a potential to influence the sigpr, but there is no easy way to stop this since the sigpr is part of the executive branch. nowhere is trump stating that the sigpr is not to report to congress at all  which would be a direct violation of the law .

"During these weeks many flights had been cancelled because of the COVID-19.

Why do some airlines and air travel agencies send confirmation emails even if the flight has been cancelled?



Examples:


LATAM: Flights from Peru were cancelled because of the state of emergency. However, one day before the flight, my flight was still appearing as SCHEDULED.

I called LATAM to ask if the flight is indeed scheduled and not cancelled. They told me that so far they do not have that specific flight marked as cancelled in their systems and they recommended to check the next day (the day of the flight). They mentioned a refund can't be done because the flight is not cancelled.

Obviously, during the night, SCHEDULED turned into CANCELLED.
Delta Airlines: Flight cancelled, but they send emails how to prepare for the flight and how to reach the airport and buy seats.
Kiwi.com and Opodo.com.uk: Flight cancelled, but they send notifications via email and push notifications to prepare for the flight and prepare my bags etc.




Apart from technical issues, is there any strategy in this scenario (e.g. marketing, whatever)?

I am a programmer and I can imagine that in the source code they can simply have an if condition checking if the flight was cancelled to not send any notifications anymore related to how to prepare for the flight.
"," i am a programmer...   international airline ticketing systems are huge, complex systems requiring interaction with the public, the staff, and other huge complex ticketing systems. ensuring an accurate and timely flow of information through such a structure is no mean feat.  these systems were built for an environment where most flights departed on or fairly close to schedued time. in a matter of weeks the world has gone from that to an environment where most flights are now cancelled.  your isimple  if   may not be simple at all, but assuming the change was to be made, the process of approval, development, testing, staging and deployment could easily take weeks. there simply has not been time for such development to take place, even assuming that the developers consider that it is worthwhile.  i suggest that with the chaos currently reigning in the air travel industry, receiving an email with directions to the airport has been considered unimportant.   airlines have bigger fish to fry.

"So far the Western nations I'm aware of seem to be trending towards the Chinese/South Korean plan for coronavirus containment:


Lockdown the entire country until the number of new cases is manageable
Introduce localized quarantines and contact tracing to minimize the number of new infections
Wait for the vaccine or cure


However point #3 is risky, as no one is sure if a vaccine can be at all created or if an effective enough cure can be developed. Therefore it might be tempting for some countries to go for an alternative approach in an attempt to balance the risks. Have any countries officially (or at least indirectly) announced such a plan?

Isolating the elderly, but no general quarantine
Chickenpox style variolation, similar to the pox parties of the past
Maintaining a full lockdown from the world without having the virus locally - 22 countries report this so far


I am aware that the situation is currently evolving around the world, so I expect new answers to trickle in within the next months. 
","if depends quite a bit what you mean by  plans other than quarantine . there are of course efforts to test anti-virals and develop a vaccine. but the amount antivirals available might not suffice in the short run, even if they prove  safe and  effective.  generally speaking however    given the lack of testing in europe and the us, the only way to keep the sick and healthy apart is to keep everyone apart. and that produces a recession.   and the alternative for that would be to test everyone. it is been done at small scale  you will be amused where  in italy, in the very first region hit, i.e. in the town of vo. but the trouble is that testing capacity does not quite scale to the  test everyone in the country  presently... except maybe in iceland, the only country i know of that that is doing random testing on a serious scale  relative to the country is size   but it is worth noting that there is convergence between random testing and the chunk of the population that gets tested in iceland:    iceland has tested a far greater proportion of its population than anywhere else on earth, including south korea -- another country touted for its effective response to the pandemic.    but what makes iceland unique is that test samples are not only taken from  high risk  individuals who have exhibited symptoms, came into contact with known carriers, or returned from countries such as china and italy, they are also offered to thousands of ordinary members of its general population, who are nonsymptomatic.   on should not discount the level of quarantines imposed in iceland either though:    across this remote and rugged island nation of a little more than 364,000, as of friday morning there were almost 10,000 men, women and children -- equivalent to 9 million americans -- under this form of state-enforced lock and key.   so it is more like  more of everything  being done over there rather than  alternative plans .    if by plans you mean plans to relax the lockdowns at some point, every country is probably thinking/considering when they can do that. economists have been spurred into providing answers to hard-choice questions that need to balance economic damage/recession with the lives saved  in the short run . see e.g.    managing economic lockdowns in an epidemic , or in more depth  the macroeconomics of epidemics   eichenbaum et al.   also covered in  the latter half of a  nyt article.   alas the experience of hong kong last week shows that lockdowns may  need to  return in some cases/areas...    i somehow missed the  odd man out , in this case, bolsonaro:    in a televised address last week, he repeated a now well-worn phrase.  it is just a little flu or the sniffles,  he said, blaming the media once again for the hysteria and panic over covid-19.    a few days later, he clearly demonstrated his prioritisation of the economy over isolation measures favoured by the rest of the world.     people are going to die, i am sorry,  he said.  but we can not stop a car factory because there are traffic accidents.      jair bolsonaro is alone right now,  says brian winter, editor-in-chief of the publication americas quarterly.  no other major world leader is denying the severity of this to the extent  ...     a few days ago, a video was shared by jair bolsonaro is son, flavio - a politician himself.    the video is message, which claimed to come from the brazilian government, was that  brazil can not stop   in portuguese,  obrasilnaopodeparar . people need to keep working to keep the country safe and the economy growing.    so much so, in fact, that a federal judge on saturday banned the government from campaigning against isolation measures. government posts on social media using the hashtag were hastily removed.     he is clearly laying the foundation of being able to say six months to a year from now that he did not agree with tough distancing measures, with the lockdown,  says oliver stuenkel, associate professor of international relations at the getulio vargas foundation in sao paulo.   that kind of internal power struggle has happened to some extent in pakistan too, although the military apparently gained the upper hand and managed to impose some level of lockdowns despite opposition from some politicians and clerics. and khan  like bolsonaro  also seems to hedge his bets:    prime minister imran khan, however, has appeared out of step with local provincial governments. he had previously said a  lockdown  would not be sustainable in pakistan, as it would cause too much harm to those on low incomes.    after provincial governments went ahead and introduced measures tantamount to a  lockdown  anyway, mr khan attempted to explain he only opposed what he described as a  curfew,  while also outlining some measures to protect the poorest in society, who are dependent on daily wages to feed their families. unlike other muslim countries, his government has not ordered an end to congregational prayers on fridays.

"I'll try and make it short.

No, we did not plan for things to happen like this. We planned for me to go to her and then come back together. COVID-19 really messed things up.
I did think I could send the documents to her by post, but that feels extremely ridiculous given that I can wait for her with the documents at the airport + It would be very very concerning, if the originals get lost in the post, given the chaos caused by COVID, as her country is on the other side of the world from Germany.


Edit - Appreciate all the answers. 

I've reached out to the relevant Bundespolizei and their answers are very cautious in this new world. I've sent out via 3 separate e-mails and received more ore less the following answer back from all 3: ""without a residence permit, third-country nationals are not allowed to enter the country for the next thirty days. To what extent an exception is possible in your situation cannot be answered at the moment. In the course of your personal responsibility you/your wife should generally refrain from travelling!"" So they have no clue how to address this. We've sent e-mails to the German embassy as well, to see if we can clarify via themselves, since the BP are asking for a residence permit or some kind of visa, where none should be required in the case of a EU Nationals' wife and which we can really only get in Germany now, since all relevant documents are here with me. 
","  normally she would enter on a 90 days tourist visa, as we do not yet have a long term family reunification visa.   your wife will never get a long-term family reunification visa because such visas are not issued to beneficiaries of the free movement directive.  as a beneficiary from a so-called  annex ii  country  that is, a country whose citizens do not need a visa for short visits , your wife is supposed to enter without a visa and then apply for a residence card after entering germany.  the trick, of course, is to find specific information about how the travel ban is being applied to non-eu citizens who enjoy freedom of movement through a family relationship but who do not yet reside in germany. this may be difficult as the number of such cases is probably small and the possibility may not have been considered by the people writing the policies.  the best i have been able to find so far is at http://www.germany.info/us-en/coronavirus/2317268  emphasis added :    eu-citzens and citizens of great brtain, iceland, liechtenstein, norway and switzerland and their family members will be allowed to transit through germany to reach their home countries.   this suggests that beneficiaries of the free movement directive are included among those who may enter germany. your wife might want to say that germany is her place of residence  which is arguably true  but that she has not yet lived there long enough to get a residence card  which is certainly true . alternatively, she should call the german authorities and ask them what to tell the airline. to that end, see how to contact border authorities in eu/schengen countries  on this site.  regarding the documents, you might try asking the airline if they will pass them to her when she gets off the plane. my wife was in a similar situation recently, and that was the solution.  part of this process was that the airline employee in the destination airport made a note in the airline is system that the documents were sufficient. this was necessary for her to be able to board the plane without having the documents with her. this may also prove necessary in your wife is case.

","first, this has never really happened in the united states. in extreme emergencies and national disasters, elections have been held a few days late, but never suspended  unlike, for example, the united kingdom, that suspended elections during world war ii . elections were also not canceled during the civil war, or as a result of the war of 1812  during which the u.s. capitol was burned to the ground by foreign military forces .  for example, elections were not prevented from being conducted by the spanish flu of 1918 which was in all respects deadlier and more contagious than the coronavirus, despite the fact that the technology available for a response in 1918 was less advanced.  realistically, you would need a disease that is catastrophic on the scale of the black plague in medieval europe  that killed a third to a half of the population in many places , and not merely something like the coronavirus  with a 2  mortality rate , to take out the electoral process in the u.s.  a situation like that would involve the collapse of the entire regime and government, and would send us into uncharted waters.  second, election laws can be changed quite quickly in an emergency. one could, for example, shift as colorado has, to a system of near complete all mail in ballots, to reduce the amount of in person interactions that were needed.  the u.s. constitution does not provide the option of not conducting an election. in the absence of an election, elected offices become vacant and the succession provisions of the law which usually kick in when there is a death during someone is term of office would kick in. u.s. senate vacancies can be filled in most states by governors on a temporary basis. u.s. house seats that go vacant must be filled in vacancy elections. there is a line of succession to the presidency defined by law involving a few key congressional leaders and the cabinet.

"Can one be immune to the new coronavirus?

Another question is what is the exact definition of ""being immune"". Does it mean that even when the virus enters my system, it cannot multiply?
","it is hypothesized that exposure to and recovery from sars-cov-2  as with other coronaviruses in humans  would generally result in short-term immunity to this strain, but we do not yet have data on this:    however, according to dr stephen gluckman, an infectious diseases physician at penn medicine and the medical director of penn global medicine, who spoke to the outlet, it seems likely that having the disease once results in immunity in most individuals - as is seen with other coronaviruses.      coronaviruses are not new, they have been around for a long, long time and many species - not just humans - get them,  he explained.  so we know a fair amount about coronaviruses in general. for the most part, the feeling is once you have had a specific coronavirus, you are immune. we do not have enough data to say that with this coronavirus, but it is likely.     this means that people who initially recovered are more likely to relapse rather than get reinfected with the virus.     according to one study, people with mild infections can test positive for the virus by throat swabs  for days and even weeks after their illness .    but, that does not mean it is not possible to contract the disease again, especially in those who are immunocompromised.      the immune response to covid-19 is not yet understood,  the centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  explains.  patients with mers-cov infection are unlikely to be reinfected shortly after they recover, but it is not yet known whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients with covid-19.     coronavirus: can you get covid-19 twice or does it cause immunity    it is also hypothesized  in humans  that previous exposure to coronaviruses may enable immunity to certain other highly related strains:    these data indicate that challenge immunity to coronaviruses is strong, but highly virus strain-specific.    virus strain specificity of challenge immunity to coronavirus., archives of virology  1989    but these are all examples of adaptive immunity - not innate.

"If the world hadn't noticed that Covid-19 was significantly different from previous situations, and if it had treated it like any other flu outbreak, what would have happened?

Typically an influenza outbreak of any kind results in nursing homes and other sensitive areas being closed to visitors and their taking extra precautions for internal cleanliness and hygiene.

If all the effort were put into protecting the most vulnerable and everyone else simply warned to be careful, the disease would spread among the general population but there would be very few serious cases.

In the short, medium, and long term, would the world be significantly better or worse than it will be with the current political actions?
","i think the following quoted article mostly answers my question.  the current, sometimes draconian, measures are not being taken to prevent the spread of covid-19, only to reduce the rate at which it spreads.  a system that can handle a hundred new patients each week for many months, typically can not handle hundreds of new patients each day for a few weeks.  in either case, the same number of people get infected.  in one case the seriously ill can be properly treated, in the other case almost no one can be properly treated.  coronavirus disease  covid-19  - our world in data contains this information:     flattening the curve     this is why early counter measures are important in an epidemic. their  intention is to lower the rate of infection so that the epidemic is  spread out over time and the peak demand for the health care system is  lower.    while the total number who get infected might not change, the  containment measures intend to avoid an outbreak trajectory in which a  large number of people get sick at the same time. this is what the  visualization shows.    this is the reason that limiting the magnitude of peak incidence of an  outbreak is important - health systems can care for more patients when  the number of cases is spread out over a long period and it is not  peaking in a very short period.    a worst-case scenario for a pandemic of covid-19 is that the number of  patients at one point in time is so large that health systems would  fail to provide the required care for some of them    ",66

Do you think that I am aiming too high? If so, what else should I look to do to improve my chances? Also if I start MS this Fall should I apply for PhD at Fall 2022 or Fall 2023?

Additional Info:


I did a decent undergrad thesis (not great, 8 months), soon after I did a 2 month internship a another research lab. During my undergrad I worked w/ a prof for 1.2 years (Got two papers out - one in a conf and another in a journal). Currently I am working in a top research lab, now remotely due to covid-19 outbreak.
Some people have mentioned other questions thinking that those had the same information that I wanted. But, they did not as the questions talked about how to get into ""a/some"" PhD Program after a low U-GPA and maybe decent masters. The schools that I have mentioned above are ranked pretty high and  would appreciate if you could tailor your answers to my specific question of getting into these schools.
I picked these school not to show of the ""rank"" or ""prestige"" which seems stupid honestly. I chose the because of the strength in the field (F1) that I'm looking to do research in. In one of my previous questions I had mentioned that I got a PhD offer from university of houston which does the research in F1 but it isn't very strong in other area such as: number of grants that they pull in to do amazing research on large patient populations, intellectual cohorts, and industrial connections and startup resources. I picked these schools as I believe them to be the best in F1 and NOT for the main purpose of prestige. So if you don't have anything to suggest I IMPLORE you to not ask me to look at other schools as I did not ask for alternatives but solutions or ideas

","it is good to aim high. it is also good to have broad target. if you apply to only a few schools with very similar profiles then being rejected by one will probably have a similar outcome at the others. so, i recommend a range of schools if you really want a degree and not just bragging rights about a top 50 school.   but, about your gpa. it is not a plus, of course, but most  not all  people who evaluate your application will weight the more recent work as more important than the earlier work. therefore, if your recent work is good and you have letters that attest to the quality of your work and your dedication, then the older numbers will be discounted by most.   but, the competition is still very strong and the slots are few. if someone has to make a choice between two candidates, the choice has to be made and lower priority things may bear some weight.   however, the only way to know whether you have a problem is to actually make application to some places and then evaluate the feedback. there are some questions, like this one, that can only be answered by actually trying. but, you will be more likely to get accepted somewhere if you do not target too narrowly.

Would symptoms differ from eating virus contaminated food versus breathing in virus?
Would symptoms be a good indicator where the virus is located?
The COVID-19 causes respiratory symptoms and I guess that is because people are breathing in virus droplets in their lungs. But if you would swallow COVID-19 contaminated food and avoid breathing in the virus would that cause other symptoms like stomach pain or diarrhea?

","well this is a guess because there is no published data that i am aware of in the english literature to be able to answer the question.  a small percentage of people who have presented with covid-19 pneumonia have also had diarrhoea, it is thought that the faecal-oral route is also an important mode of transmission.   if the person develops a respiratory infection the affected cells will eventually spill virus into the circulation, a condition called viraemia. this allows the virus to reach distant cells that bear the ace2 surface receptor and these cells are also in the heart, kidneys and gut as well as monocytes. one would also expect that intestinal cells affected primarily by ingestion of virus particles would also do the same, and produce a viraemia leading to the virus spreading to the lungs, heart and kidneys. but they may present initially with diarrhoea before getting respiratory symptoms.

"I am flying this week from Munich to London, and Bavaria just got the first contaminated person, who now has the Coronavirus 2019-nCoV after interacting with Chinese colleague. Two cases of the novel coronavirus have been confirmed in the UK, and the number of cases in Germany has grown. Moreover, the Coronavirus has now been declared a global health emergency by WHO.

I got a bunch of emails from SOS International and such, on what methodology I should follow to mitigate the risk of getting infected, but none of them addresses the following (hopefully extreme) hypothetical scenario:


  I go to my seat, and I suspect the person next to me (or in neighboring seats) has the Coronavirus related symptoms (high fever, short breath, etc.). How should I react, without being too paranoid? 


Go in the back to secretly communicate that to the flight attendant, and request a seat change? 



Update (Feb 2): I am now in Munich airport, and both pharmacies (before and after security check) have no typical plastic masks (sold-out). They only have some conical-sized ones. The airport does not provide masks (asked in the Information). I advise you to buy a typical plastic mask before coming to the airport.
","a cabin crewmember here.  this is different from airline to another, and country to another, but i can safely assume there are a lot of similarities when it comes to this, as most of the airlines get the instructions from local civil aviation authorities and local health ministries, both authorities get the information from higher global organizations.   the airline i work for supplied its fleet recently with a contagious disease kit, which shall be used by the cabin crew once there are signs of an infected passenger. this kit includes masks to be distributed once needed, a disinfectant liquid  the same as in hospitals  to clean surfaces around the sick passenger, gloves, etc. also, my airline allowed its crewmembers to wear masks if they wish to on flights from/to certain destinations.  as i said, not sure if the same is being followed by other airlines. regardless of that, you should inform the cabin crew right away, they are in this with you, they will know what to do. these days our mailboxes are being filled with health information and updates regarding this, and because we are exposed more than the average person, we really care about this.  finally, what you should worry about is the infected people during the incubation period with no symptoms at all  this has been confirmed , they are as contagious with no way of knowing that. people with fever  a common symptom after the virus incubation period  will not be allowed to board. therefore, it is advised that you follow basic prevention measures, such as washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth, cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, wear a mask  n-95 mask , etc.  this seems like a virus masterpiece, only the coming few days will let us know how serious this is.

"Like a lot of amateurs, I would like to see how well the evolution of Covid-19 is predictable. So I imported the data (here, for Italy) and fitted a logistic curve. Then I added the 90% and 95% confidence bounds. I got the following plot:



Great. The next day, I updated my plot with the latest data and realized that the estimation was had been quite optimistic and the asymptote is now much increased (same scale in both pictures):



Questions I understand that if the logistic model had been good, the next point should have been in the confidence range with a probability of 90% (or 95%). Can I conclude that the logistic model is not a good model here? Are there some standard procedures to assess the validity of the prediction by taking into account the uncertainty on the model?

Also, the difference between the two asymptotes gives me an indication of the precision of the prediction (it is not off by 1 or by 10^5 but by about 500 deaths). Is there some classic methods to take this into account?

Edit 21/03/2020: clarification in response to hakan's answer

The model I fitted is 
$$\dfrac{c}{1 + a e^{-b x}}$$
and with $a=514434$, $b=-0.276$ and $c=5568$. Of course, this model is the same as @hakanc's, with a different parametrization (e.g. his $K$ corresponds to my $c$). The corresponding covariance matrix is
$$\begin{bmatrix} 1.1\times 10^{10}&amp; 641 &amp; -2.5\times 10^7 \\ \star &amp; 3.8\times 10^{-5} &amp; -1.6\\ \star &amp; \star &amp; 80\times 10^3 \end{bmatrix}$$

I believe the low sensitivity to $c$ ($=K$) is described by the $(3,3)$ component of the covariance matrix, $\sigma=\sqrt{80\times 10^3}\approx 280$. So though I understand (and agree with) the argument of low sensitivity, I believe it is already included in the ""confidence band"".
","when working with mathematical models, it is always good to check the assumptions of the model. the logistic function is often used when modelling population growth, and specifically where the rate of reproduction is proportional to both the existing population and the amount of available resources, all else being equal. letting  p  represent population size, the differential equation is        displaystyle   frac  dp  dt   rp cdot  left 1-  frac  p  k   right ,     where the constant  r  defines the growth rate and  k  is the carrying capacity, see the link for more details. the solution, letting  p 0  be the initial population, is    p t    frac  kp  0 e  rt   k p  0  left e  rt -1 right       thus, this model would be appropriate if italy did nothing to mitigate the spread of the virus, but they are in fact using quarantine. the effect of wrong modelling assumptions would be that if you cross-validated the fitted model, you would get poor results.   additionally, since the shape of the logistic function is     and in your data, it does not seem to include the part where the curve flattens out, i would suspect that the parameter describing that phenomenon,  k , would have a high variance from your estimation procedure. an intuitive explanation for this can be done by plotting the function for different  k  and constant  r :    in this figure, if there is only data for  t  between 0 and 1 would not reveal so much information on  k , other than if  k  is around 10, compared to  k  gt  100 . more formally, assuming you are doing maximum likelihood estimation, you can look at the eigenvalues of the hessian of the corresponding likelihood function, to see if optimization problem is well conditioned.

Of course, we can exclude people who do not know, and people who have important things to do.
","communicable diseases are endemic to the human condition  some places, times and situations are riskier than others but there is always a risk in widespread travel. outside of disease spread, there are other risks in travel  for example, if no-one traveled at all there would be no motor vehicle deaths.  on the flip-side, not traveling has its own dangers  for example, you will not die in a house fire if you are in your car.  of course, there are enormous benefits to widespread travel  economic, cultural and personal - life is to be experienced after all.  if you stop the skier from skiing, then you have just damaged the livelihood of all the people who depend on tourism  the airline, the hotel, the bartender, the ski technician, the baker in the ski resort etc.  everything is allowed unless it is prohibited  by and large, this is the way that the law works. it is legal to do anything you like. unless it is not.  it is not illegal to travel to, say, finland. so you can.  if the government  of whichever country  decides that the costs of allowing people to travel to finland now outweigh the benefits then they can prohibit it. however, that is a political decision  not a legal one.  as for your drink-driving example, i am old enough to remember when it was not illegal to drive drunk, although i was too young to drive. of course, if you are in somalia or kenya it is still legal. also, what counts a drunk varies by country - you can have a couple in finland but cross over into russia and you are breaking the law. why does finland allow such recklessness  because it is a political decision and politicians in finland and russia have reached different conclusions about what level of risk is acceptable. same with travel restrictions.

"The WHO was against travel restrictions as they detailed in a press release at the end of February. But in the month past (March) practically every country on earth has instituted travel restrictions, most recently China, which is now afraid of being reinfected from abroad.

So, has the WHO changed their public stance in any way about travel restrictions by now? I searched a bit, but it seems they've gone mum on the topic of travel, while (of course) strongly advocating for social distancing in general. (Aside: the WHO wants us to use ""physical distancing"" as the more appropriate term for that.)

I haven't done anything like a survey on this, but clearly some governments include ""minimize travel"" in the physical distantincing advice they give, e.g. Australia's 


  Government advice for implementing physical distancing has mainly urged people to isolate themselves in space: staying at least 1.5 metres apart, working from home, avoiding gatherings, and minimising travel.


So maybe the WHO has done the same somewhere in their recommendations and I've missed it.

Likewise, there have been at least three (high-profile) publications in Science this month on this:


March 6


  the travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in Mainland China, but has a more marked effect at the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80% until mid February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.

March 25


  It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.

March 31


  The Wuhan shutdown was associated with the delayed arrival of COVID-19 in other cities by 2.91 days (95%CI: 2.54-3.29). [...] This analysis provided no evidence that the prohibition of travel between cities, which was implemented after and in addition to the Wuhan shutdown on 23 January, reduced the number of cases in other cities across China. These results are robust to the choice of statistical regression model. [It also analyzes, and finds effective (via association), most city-level social-distancing measures:] Our model suggests that, without the Wuhan travel ban or the national emergency response, there would have been 744,000 (± 156,000) confirmed COVID-19 cases outside Wuhan by 19 February, day 50 of the epidemic. With the Wuhan travel ban alone, this number would have decreased to 202,000 (± 10,000) cases. With the national emergency response alone (without the Wuhan travel ban), the number of cases would have decreased to 199,000 (± 8500). Thus, neither of these interventions would, on their own, have reversed the rise in incidence by 19 February. But together and interactively, these control measures offer an explanation of why the rise in incidence was halted and reversed, limiting the number of confirmed cases reported to 29,839 (fitted model estimate 28,000 ± 1400 cases), 96% fewer than expected in the absence of interventions.



So maybe there's a ""wind of change"" in the scientific community on this, maybe not, but perhaps it's too early to tell what the consensus might become on this. So I'm ""holding off"" on accepting the answer below for now (based on a non-mention in a March 11 WHO statement) as rather inconclusive.
","the who released a joined statement with the icao   on the who website it is dated 11 march 2020 . it does not mention travel restrictions directly. it does, however, stress cooperation at different levels, for example between  aviation and health authorities .   my interpretation is that the who is leaving such restrictions up to the states, at least in their public statements.

Can I get an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) and a Paycheck Protection Program Loan (PPP)?,"yes, you can get both loans, but the key is to use the money to cover different expenses. section 1102 a  2  g , the section outlining the ppp loans, explains the borrower requirements. it says the borrower has to certify that  the eligible recipient has not received amounts under this subsection for the same purpose and duplicative amounts.  as a reminder, eidls can be used to cover:  paid sick leave to employees unable to work due to the direct effect of covid-19. maintain payroll increased costs due to supply chain disruption rent or mortgage payments repaying obligations that cannot be met due to revenue loss  ppp loan funds can be used to cover:  payroll costs group health care benefits during periods of paid, sick, medical, or family leave, and insurance premiums. interest on a mortgage obligation rent, under lease agreements in force before february 15, 2020 utilities, for which service began before february 15, 2020 interest on any debt incurred before february 15, 2020  so, if you are getting an eidl to cover payroll expenses, you can not get a ppp to cover payroll for the length of the forgiveness period  eight weeks from when the loan is due . you would have to use the eidl for different operating expenses or payroll for a different period. this will also go for other state or local assistance. that being said, you do not have to have both. if you have already gotten an eidl for payroll purposes but just want the ppp loan, you can refinance the loan into a ppp. any amount that was given to you as a grant under the eidl will reduce the amount forgiven under ppp.",148
"I have a question related to SARS-CoV-2 virus spreaded in the air. 

This Straits Time article from March 18 describes a new study: 


  The tests show that when the virus is carried by the droplets released when someone coughs or sneezes, it remains viable, or able to still infect people, in aerosols for at least three hours.


Examples of aerosol are fog, dust, particulate air pollutants (e.g. pollen), smoke, etc.

That being said, is essentially saying that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is all over in the air, right?

I am saying that SARS-CoV-2 virus can be everywhere in the world. Why? Because, for example, dust is everywhere in the air and air is not static, i.e. ""it flies"" from one site to another and hence it can move to a place where no infected people have been at.

Am I understanding this correctly?

Thank you in advance
","you are not understanding it correctly  there is a significant difference between an aerosol, dust and droplets. furthermore the intermixing of air is not as you claim it is, it is in fact, quite static. if air just went everywhere immediately there would not be clouds, temperature differences, or indeed any weather effects at all.  a question you could ask yourself is: with my current understanding, covid-19 should be everywhere. there should not exist differences between cities and rural areas, or between countries. but there is.  listen to the advice of health services and the government. they know their shit.

"I live in Iran and I have bought this Qatar Airways flight from Tehran (Iran) to Vienna for February 29. As far as I know, to this moment the flight is not cancelled for health concerns regarding Coronavirus. Although I don't know of any way to make sure about that. So I might have to go to airport and see what is going on. 

And I don't want to cancel the flight, since I should be there in Vienna for my job starting March 1.

But, in case the flight is not cancelled by the airline, I don't know what is going to happen to me at the airports. Some people say that they might put me in quarantine at Qatar airport or at Vienna airport, maybe for 14 days. 

Has anyone have any view or experience regarding such conditions? I am kind of panicked and overwhelmed by thoughts and concerns.  
","the first thing you should do is contact your new employer. they may have procedures in place for any people coming for affected zones  china, northern italy, iran...  to be isolated from other staff and/or the public.  it is difficult to guess what measures will be taken by the various authorities in iran, qatar and austria regarding quarantine and isolation, or even outright travel bans, as this can change by the hour.  qatar airways have already cancelled 2 out of 3 of the flights from tehran to doha these last few days, and in the upcoming days.  even if there are no bans or quarantines, and even taking into account switching to a larger plane and cancellations/rebookings, squeezing passengers booked on 3 different flights on a single probably means severe overbooking. be prepared to be bumped off the flight if there are qatari citizens or residents and/or premium passengers that need a seat on that plane.  the remaining flight on saturday has been rescheduled to over an hour earlier. add to that there will probably be lots of additional checks before boarding, and the fact that there will be overbooking, and you should be at the airport a lot earlier that you would normally have, probably before midnight. you want to be the first in the queue. if online/mobile check-in is possible, do it as soon as it opens. you want your boarding pass to show  seq 001 .  i suppose the rescheduling is to account for additional checks on arrival  as well as thorough disinfection of the aircraft after the flight  in order not to have issues with short connections.  current qatar airways procedures for flights from iran:    in line with various global and local health warnings, all incoming passengers from iran and south korea whose final destination is doha and are showing no symptoms of the novel coronavirus will be asked to stay in home isolation or a quarantine facility for 14 days.    passengers arriving from those countries who are showing symptoms will be transferred to the communicable disease centre at the hamad medical corporation.   so if you do not show any symptoms and are only in transit, you should have no issue boarding the flight to vienna, unless austria implements bans or quarantines by then.  good luck  ",101
"President Trump's presidential proclamation specifically defines the countries affected by the ban as the 26 signatories to the Schengen Treaty:


  For purposes of this proclamation, the Schengen Area comprises 26
  European states: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,
  Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia,
  Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway,
  Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.


However, four European states also maintain open or semi-open borders with the Schengen area, namely Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, &amp; Vatican City. Clearly travellers from these countries will also be subject to the separate ban on people that have visited Schengen countries in the last 14 days, but considering the (semi)open borders, there should be no way to definitively prove this status one way or the other.

Are these countries exempt from the ban? Is this an oversight by the Trump administration, or do methods exist to identify travellers from these countries who have recently returned from the Schengen area proper?
","given that none of these countries have their own international airports, and all but monaco are landlocked, it is effectively impossible for nationals of those microstates to reach the us without visiting a schengen country.   presumably, someone from monaco who travels by boat to the uk and flies from there could get away with entry or any nationals who are currently outside the schengen area, but i imagine the final decision will come down to an ice official who will compare the passport to a list of affected countries.

Am I at risk for COVID-19 from a package or products shipping from China?,"there is still a lot that is unknown about covid-19 and how it spreads. this coronaviruses is thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. currently there is no evidence to support transmission of covid-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of covid-19 in the united states associated with imported goods. information will be provided on the coronavirus disease 2019  covid-19  website as it becomes available.",47
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?,"you can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading covid-19 by taking some simple precautions:   1: regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. why  washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.   2: maintain at least 1 metre  3 feet  distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. why  when someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. if you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the covid-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.   3: avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. why  hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. from there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.   4: make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. this means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. then dispose of the used tissue immediately. why  droplets spread virus. by following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and covid-19.   5: stay home if you feel unwell. if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. follow the directions of your local health authority. why  national and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. this will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.   6: keep up to date on the latest covid-19 hotspots  cities or local areas where covid-19 is spreading widely . if possible, avoid traveling to places - especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. why  you have a higher chance of catching covid-19 in one of these areas.",46
How long does the virus survive on surfaces?,"it is not certain how long the virus that causes covid-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. studies suggest that coronaviruses  including preliminary information on the covid-19 virus  may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. this may vary under different conditions  e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment . if you think a surface may be infected, clean it with a simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.",55
Should I be tested for the virus?,"it is not completely up to you.    the cdc recently rolled out new guidance, allowing anyone to be tested for covid-19 without restrictions, as long as their doctor approves. testing is on the rise in the u.s., but experts say it is not yet enough.    if you have traveled to an area with local transmission or have been in close contact with someone who has been exposed to the virus, and develop symptoms, such as cough or fever, your health care provider can work with the local health department to determine whether you should be tested for covid-19.    if you have symptoms, but no travel history to an outbreak area, you could go to a clinic and have a rapid test done to rule out more common viruses, such as influenza, merson advised.    if you have mild symptoms and are worried that you might have covid-19, call your doctor or local health department instead of going to a clinic or doctor is office without an appointment, to ensure you are not potentially exposing others to the virus. if you have severe breathing problems, seek medical attention or call 911 immediately, recommends dr. jennifer ashton, abc news  chief medical correspondent.    you should let the person you speak with know that you have respiratory problems and need to be isolated and seen right away.",38

How does COVID-19 spread?,"people can catch covid-19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid-19 coughs or exhales. these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. people can also catch covid-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter  3 feet  away from a person who is sick. who is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings. can the virus that causes covid-19 be transmitted through the air studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. see previous answer on  how does covid-19 spread  can covid-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. however, many people with covid-19 experience only mild symptoms. this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. who is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of covid-19 and will continue to share updated findings. can i catch covid-19 from the feces of someone with the disease the risk of catching covid-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. while initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. who is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating.",44
"A great many top US physics PhD programs have canceled their open houses with no plan to reschedule.

"Lombardy, a region of Italy, registered many severe cases of COVID-19 in the last few months.
Unfortunately the available data don't allow us to estimate the percentage P of people who contracted the virus in Lombardy (please don't dispute this, but take it as an assumption).
Now, suppose we have a medical test that says wether a person contracted the virus or not (EDIT: let's assume that the test always gives the correct answer). How many people should we test to estimate P with sufficiently small error?

Data are:


10 million people live in Lombardy.
P can be assumed to be at least 4 %.
No assumption can be made about the uniform distribution of P, neither geographically, nor by age, gender or whatever.
A satisfactory error percent on P would be 25%.


A related question is: how could we confirm the estimated error on P once we have the data? For example, could we bootstrap the data?

","this is actually a handbook example of determining the sample size needed for estimating binomial proportion  e.g. jones et al, 2004, naing, 2003 for other references and examples .  first of all, to make it more precise, we are talking about finding such sample size, that with probability   alpha , the difference between the true probability of being infected  p  and it is estimate   hat p  is not greater then   100 times delta ,          pr  p -  hat p   le  delta p     alpha     given that the target population is large, we would usually assume binomial distribution to represent it, i.e. we say that it is large enough, that the chance of randomly sampling someone more then once is negligible. the distribution is parametrized by probability of  success   here, probability of being infected   p  and the number of samples we draw  n . let is denote the observed number of infected people as  k , in such case,   hat p   k/n  is the fraction of infected people in the sample and we treat it as an estimate of the number of infected people in the whole population. if we wanted to calculate confidence interval for   hat p , we could use normal approximation      hat p  pm z  alpha  sqrt  frac  hat p 1- hat p   n       where  z  alpha  is the ordinate from standard normal distribution, where for  z  drawn from standard normal distribution we have   pr -z  alpha  lt  z  lt  z  alpha     alpha . you are saying, that you would like to see this interval to be equal to   hat p  pm  delta p . as discussed in the linked resources, you can solve this, so that for given  p , precision   delta , and certanity   alpha , you can guesstimate the sample size needed     n  approx  big  frac z  alpha   delta p  big  2    p 1-p      assuming   100  times  alpha      99    confidence interval, we can plot this for different values of  p , to find out that for  100  times p  gt  4     the needed sample sizes are generally not much larger then  2000  samples.    for example, for  p 0.04    4    infected  this yields:     gt  z  lt - function alpha  qnorm alpha   gt  n  lt - function p, alpha 0.99, delta 0.25   z alpha / p delta   2   p  1-p   gt  n 0.04   1  2078.167   to convince yourself, you can verify this by simulation, where you would draw  n  samples from binomial distribution with probability of infection  p , repeat this procedure  r  times, and then verify how often was your result not further then   100  times  delta      from the true value:   gt  set.seed 123   gt  sim  lt - function p, n, delta, nsim 50000  mean abs p - rbinom nsim, n, p /n  / p  lt   delta   gt  sim 0.04, 2078, 0.25   1  0.97858   so we wanted to be  99    sure and the approximation gives us, while the in the simulation, in  97.8    cases the result was within the interval. not bad.  notice that this is just a simple approximation for the calculation, assuming simple random sampling. in case of whole population locked in their houses, sampling individuals at random may be not as hard as in case of most of the usual surveys. on another hand, things may not go as smooth as planned, or you may be willing to use other sampling schema, to have higher chance for it being representative, what would make calculating it more complicated. moreover, the tests used are not perfect and give false results as described, for example by new york times, or washington post, and you would need to account for that as well. also you need to remember, there were many examples where such simple problems get more complicated then expected, e.g. social surveys on trump is support before the election got very wrong, nonetheless that they used state of art survey methodology.

"I have been hearing a lot of people say that it is recommended to wash your hands thoroughly in order to maximise protection against COVID-19 infection. I also heard that the washing hands rumours are just a way to make people believe that they are protecting themselves and that the washing hands thing is actually not backed up by real data. 

Question:  


  Is washing hands really that useful? And if yes, is there any data backed up to defend this?


The reason i'm asking this is because an expert in this field said that the ""data is very week behind this"" and ""it's not going to have a big impact on preventing infection"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw) 43:32 and that the data behind the virus being infected through the eyes is very sparse (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw) 44:00
","here is an article that i found helpful, to understand why washing hands with soap is so helpful, and how it helps  pall thordarson is a professor of chemistry at the university of new south wales, sydney :    why does soap work so well on the sars-cov-2, the coronavirus and  indeed most viruses  the short story: because the virus is a  self-assembled nanoparticle in which the weakest link is the lipid   fatty  bilayer. soap dissolves the fat membrane and the virus falls  apart like a house of cards and dies - or rather, we should say it  becomes inactive as viruses are not really alive.    the slightly longer story is that most viruses consist of three key  building blocks: ribonucleic acid  rna , proteins and lipids. a  virus-infected cell makes lots of these building blocks, which then  spontaneously self-assemble to form the virus. critically, there are  no strong covalent bonds holding these units together, which means you  do not necessarily need harsh chemicals to split those units apart.  when an infected cell dies, all these new viruses escape and go on to  infect other cells. some end up also in the airways of lungs.    when you cough, or especially when you sneeze, tiny droplets from the  airways can fly up to 10 metres. the larger ones are thought to be the  main coronavirus carriers and they can go at least two metres.    these tiny droplets end on surfaces and often dry out quickly. but the  viruses remain active. human skin is an ideal surface for a virus. it  is  organic  and the proteins and fatty acids in the dead cells on the  surface interact with the virus.    when you touch, say, a steel surface with a virus particle on it, it  will stick to your skin and hence get transferred on to your hands. if  you then touch your face, especially your eyes, nostrils or mouth, you  can get infected. and it turns out that most people touch their face  once every two to five minutes.    washing the virus off with water alone might work. but water is not  good at competing with the strong, glue-like interactions between the  skin and the virus. water is not enough.    soapy water is totally different. soap contains fat-like substances  known as amphiphiles, some of which are structurally very similar to  the lipids in the virus membrane. the soap molecules  compete  with  the lipids in the virus membrane. this is more or less how soap also  removes normal dirt from the skin.    the soap not only loosens the  glue  between the virus and the skin  but also the velcro-like interactions that hold the proteins, lipids  and rna in the virus together.    alcohol-based products, which pretty much includes all  disinfectant   products, contain a high-percentage alcohol solution  typically 60-80   ethanol  and kill viruses in a similar fashion. but soap is better  because you only need a fairly small amount of soapy water, which,  with rubbing, covers your entire hand easily. whereas you need to  literally soak the virus in ethanol for a brief moment, and wipes or  rubbing a gel on the hands does not guarantee that you soak every  corner of the skin on your hands effectively enough.    so, soap is the best, but do please use alcohol-based sanitiser when  soap is not handy or practical.

Should I use soap and water or a hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19?,"handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing  going to the bathroom  and before eating or preparing food. if soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60  alcohol.",107

(I'd probably rely on the ""really want to"" case myself, but it seems to be considered an exception by those imposing the restriction.)
","dogs - like humans - usually choose a certain place as their  bathroom  to do their business there. as long as the poop does not pile up without ever disappearing, they will stick to this bathroom.  if your dog is toilet trained, it learned that the bathroom is somewhere outside and never in the house. if you really lock it up inside there are 2 consequences:   your dog will hold its pee and poop as long as possible, because it cannot go to the bathroom. that is very uncomfortable and can have negative effects on the health. sooner or later, your dog has to make a mess, every single day. it will learn that the toilet is now inside the house and it will be extremely hard to stop this behavior again if the covid-19 crisis is over.   so my best advice is: go outside for your dogs toiletry needs, no matter what your government says.  the quote implies that your government is very aware that it is impossible to lock dogs inside the house.     if you really want to walk your dog, do it around your house - it ends there.    if you do not have a yard where your dog can do its business, you have a reason to  really want to walk your dog . but please stick to the streets / walkways closest to your home and do not wander through half the city into a crouded dog park. if one round around the house is not enough for your dog, walk 2 or 3 rounds around the house, but do stay close to the house.

As you can see from the points above, both sides criticized and haggled before enacting the CARES Act. But the Federal Reserve has spent way more than $2.250T! Isn't this a contradiction? Why haven't Congress Members criticized or haggled the Federal Reserve like Democrats and Republicans are criticizing each other in Congress? 
Doesn't the CARES Act prove that the Fed isn't spending, or hasn't spent, enough money on the the right people?  If the Fed was giving money to the right people, then would the US need the CARES Act? 

","broadly speaking, the fed can only keep markets liquid by doing things like buying assets or making loans to banks against assets owned by the banks. that is awesome if you are worried that mortgage-backed securities are tanking in value and the fed can come along and prop up their value until the panic is over. that is a concern today but it was a much bigger concern back in 2008 when the housing bubble burst.   it is useless if your goal is to get money into the hands of people or small businesses that need it to pay rent or pay their mortgages today. if congress wants to get money to those folks, it has to pass legislation to spend the money.  fed spending is also very different from congressional spending because the fed is generally buying  or lending against  assets, it is not generating spending that drives demand. most of the fed is  1.5 t involves going to banks that have some assets and saying  hey, nice assets. we would love to give you a cheap loan if you put those assets up as collateral.  that ensures that banks have plenty of money on hand to be able to lend out and ensures that there is a willing buyer for whatever assets the fed is lending against. eventually, though, banks are going to give the fed back that  1.5 t with a small bit of interest.

"In light of the Covid-19 crisis, my country's banks have seen their shares' prices drop. Last week, the banks announced that they will doing a share buyback, and this week, the prices of the shares have increased...

Is there any reason why the banks are buying their own shares at a crisis like this? 
","assume there is a corporation that makes spoons, with  10m in cash. its single factory is already pumping out as many spoons as it can. there is also no need to open a new factory, because our market research team has determined that no one will buy the new spoons from the new factory. our r amp d team does not know how to make anything but spoons.  so, what does the company do with the cash  it could  1  sit on it, and earn basically nothing. or it could  2  invest it in something completely unrelated to the spoon business. or, it could  3  send it back to the shareholders. let is look at each option:   1  if the company just keeps the cash in the bank account, then it will earn basically no interest, and the investors who own shares in the corporation will be unhappy to get such little returns on corporate assets. if they wanted to have a low-risk cash portfolio, they would do that with their own money, they would not want their spoon-making-investment to make that decision for them.   2  if the company invests in non-spoon related things, then perhaps it will get into trouble by making foolish business decisions. buying a fork-making factory could lead to trouble - why what if our spoon scientists forget to make the tines, and just makes the whole thing rounded, based on what worked for them in spoon making   again, if a company steps outside of its area of expertise, it is deciding, on behalf of its shareholders, to diversify its portfolio. but the shareholders could make that decision themselves, and does not necessarily want the corporation to make this decision. note that some companies do successfully diversify, but it is typically part of an overarching plan that makes sense together, or else it often fails.   3  if the company returns the cash to the shareholders they can decide for themselves what to do with the cash. some will invest in low-risk things like government bonds or simple savings accounts earning minimal interest. some will invest in competing spoon-makers, and some might invest in new fork-making ventures. but the decision on how to invest goes back to the individual shareholders.  buying back stock is just one way to get money back to shareholders. the other common way would be to pay out a dividend. in financial theory, there are basically 3 differences between a share buy-back and a dividend:  a  a buyback is optional, meaning only the shareholders looking to sell their shares, will have shares bought by the company   b  a buyback happens relative to the current share price in the market, meaning that part of the decision to make a buyback could be based on whether the company believes itself to be undervalued  and  c  the tax implications are different  in general, most countries tax capital gains on selling your shares, at a lower rate than corporate dividends .  so, why would a bank do a share buyback right now  probably because interest rates are at a historic low, meaning that the bank has a limited ability to invest its capital to earn what it feels are good returns. so instead, it is leaving the choice to its shareholders how to invest - and because the bank probably feels its shares are undervalued, it is preferential to do this instead of paying a dividend. for the shareholders who remain in the company, the increase in share price is an indication that the decision made by the bank was one that benefited them.  quick note on the political aspect hinted at here: the main reason it is contentious to do a share buy-back in times like this, is that a government could give a stimulus package to a business, with the goal of having that business invest in itself, hire workers, etc.  if instead of investing in itself it just pays out the cash to shareholders, the government has effectively  bailed out  the relatively wealthy individuals who own shares, rather than the working class who they were attempting to get jobs for.

"In wealthy first-world countries, although social distancing hurts on a social and economic basis, it is at least feasible for a certain time. Basically every country world-wide has now implemented such measures. 

Reports from outside the first-world, however, make it seem like this is a much more challenging policy to implement. Police in South Africa are firing rubber bullets at shoppers who are violating lockdown and in India there are literally millions on the march home despite the country's lockdown order. Staying at home and keeping distance is impossible in slums with huts and no running water. Furthermore, poor people also much less able to survive a period without income and poorer countries are less able to provide them with support during this period.

Is there good evidence whether or not current lockdown/social distancing measures are sustainable in poorer third-world countries? If not, are there any other options for such countries to fight global pandemic that can be sustained and enforced?  
","in many  poorer non-first world countries  it is going to be very challenging. people often need to work every day in order to  eat  the next day, which prohibits social distancing measures. they have a problem with the availability of sanitation - for hand cleaning. the density of the population in some of these countries is also very significant, which can provide an additional risk factor for a greater spread of the virus.  from past epidemics for example in sub-saharan africa, they needed a lot of mostly international humanitarian help. medical systems in poor countries usually have little capacity to deal with a huge number of cases. they also do not have a way for effective testing for the virus, laboratories... the question is to what extent can humanitarian help be made available.    rich countries  and international organizations providing governance, medicine, and other resources are currently in the core of epidemics themselves. this crisis is also economically challenging, which adds prohibitive cost to invest in humanitarian help for poorer countries. imf is currently planning to lend around  1trn to developing countries, and hopefully, g20 will also provide at least some humanitarian capacity to help them. from a political point of perspective, china can use this as an opportunity to extend its influence over developing economies requiring help with fighting covid virus.  prohibitive measures could also be used by some of the political regimes to tighten their grip on power which could lead to destabilization.  on the other hand for example in india, you have a huge pharmaceutical sector which makes medicine, which can help in providing antibiotics or other types of medicine which could be beneficial for sick people.  the virus could also be weakened by a warm climate, which is not yet scientifically proven. population structure in poor countries is usually much younger, which is another benefit, although people can be malnourished and have different medical problems which could make things worse if they were to become infected by coronavirus.  sources, to read more: the coronavirus could devastate poor countries economist-coronavirus-in-india ",128

","http://www.sciencefocus.com/nature/do-viruses-die/:    strictly speaking, viruses can not die, for the simple reason that they are not alive in the first place. although they contain genetic instructions in the form of dna  or the related molecule, rna , viruses can not thrive independently. instead, they must invade a host organism and hijack its genetic instructions.   http://www.sciencealert.com/how-long-does-coronavirus-last-on-surfaces:    just hanging about in the atmosphere, the effect of factors such as uv light and heat causes the mix of rna, fatty membrane, and protein making up the  viruses  to steadily break down in a few hours  or less/more .   http://www.statnews.com/2020/03/19/coronavirus-survives-on-surfaces-how-to-protect-yourself/  mirror :    viruses covered in  envelopes  have the most trouble surviving outside a living cell. on surfaces, the surrounding light, heat, and dryness break down the envelope, killing the virus.  porous surfaces pull moisture away from viruses that land on them, accelerating the destruction of the envelope.  most rhinoviruses have such envelopes  so do some influenza viruses. norovirus does not, enabling it to last longer in the environment.

"Recently several US cities banned large gatherings of events such as listed here.  Given that the 1st amendment of the US constitution states 


  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
  prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
  speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
  assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.


How is banning such events constitutional with the freedom of assembly?  If it were a political protest/gathering would this change?
","  how is banning such events constitutional with the freedom of  assembly    the rights created by the first amendment are not absolute. they are subject to reasonable restrictions as to time, place and manner, especially if those restrictions are content neutral.   restrictions narrowly tailored to protect against genuine threats public health and safety fall within the exception of the first amendment even if they are not strictly content neutral, that is commonly described by the rubric that you do not have a right to falsely cry  fire  in a crowded theater  causing a riot that could harm people .   for example, suppose that a rope bridge over a deep gorge can only support the weight of ten people, and three dozen people want to hold a protest there. a regulation that prohibited more than ten people from engaging in the protest would be constitutional.  even then, however, a lack of content neutrality  e.g., restricting punishment to false statements likely to incite a riot  can not also be a lack of ideological neutrality  e.g. restricting punishment to anti-catholic but not anti-jewish statements likely to incite a riot .    if it were a political protest/gathering would this change    generally speaking political protest/gatherings are still subject to content neutral regulations of time, place or manner, and those narrowly tailored to protect genuine threats public health and safety.  so, for example, if there is a genuine covid-19 risk that public health officials are trying to address, and the regulation of gatherings is not viewpoint or content based, it would be upheld as constitutional in the face of a first amendment freedom of assembly limitation.  but, if the regulation applied, for example, only to republican and not democratic party protests or gatherings, which is a viewpoint or content based restriction, it would not survive a first amendment freedom of assembly challenge.

"I was reading about a viral list of dubious coronavirus tips on The Verge and reached this tip:


  “Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water or other
  liquids will wash them down through your throat and into the stomach.
  Once there, your stomach acid will kill all the virus,” one tip reads.
  Loren Rauch, an emergency room doctor in Los Angeles who has a
  master’s degree in epidemiology, told Mother Jones this advice was
  “totally bogus.”


I asked a friend, who has a PhD. in cell biology, about this and she said that it's true that a virus would be killed by the stomach acid (i.e. due to high acidity, or low pH value, of stomach acid which could easily break the structure of the virus); however, she added that it's NOT true to think that drinking water would wash the virus from your respiratory system (i.e. trachea or lungs) into your stomach, so drinking water regularly does not necessarily help if it's in your respiratory system.

I was a bit confused since the doctor referenced in the article considered the whole advice as totally false; on the other hand, my friend thinks at least part of the advice, i.e. the virus being killed by stomach acid, is true.

Now, my question is not limited to coronavirus and I am not seeking medical advice or treatment here. I just want to  know if my friend is scientifically correct, i.e. whether stomach acid is able to destroy the biological structure of a virus (any virus, and not necessarily coronavirus)? And if so, how does this work biologically?

"So I am reading and listening to the news, watching the numbers re Covid-19, listening to and reading apocalyptic accounts of the coming recession, hearing of record breaking unemployment reports and then doubling those numbers the next week...

And the stock market goes down 1-2% and then stages a bit of a rally at the end of the day... (April 3)

I get that there has been a 20+% drop already, but it just seems to me that this doesn't account for the seriousness of the situation moving forward.

I am new to the trading/investing world (I've always been a buy-and-holder until a month ago when I saw the writing on the wall and got out when the markets were down just a few percent). But I'm just trying to figure out why there isn't more market movement downwards. Can somebody help me understand?
","market reactions to information are not always timely, proportional, or rational.   we do not know the full impact of our current situation  we are feeling it out.   some people  bulls , believe that the initial dip was an over-reaction, that the government response will prevent further decline, and/or that things will go back to normal pretty quickly, so they are buying the dip. on the other side you have people  bears  that believe the initial reaction was just a start but not enough to price-in the full impact, that the government can not prop up the economy, and/or that this will drag on for a long while, so they are betting on further decline.    the problem with this idea of information being priced-in is that we all know there is a global pandemic, but there are very different opinions about how much that should affect the market.  consider unemployment levels: we have projections about unemployment rate potentially hitting a peak over 30 . meanwhile, the current unemployment rate is 4.4  and projected to hit double digits in april. the only way all of that information could be appropriately priced in is if everyone agreed about the reasonableness of the projections and had the economic prowess to understand the actual impact of those figures.  instead, what happens is that some people will see the actual april unemployment numbers as surprising new information to react to, while others will see it as old information in line with their expectations. add in thousands of other pieces of information about which people have conflicting opinions, and it becomes pretty much impossible to know in advance if that information was all priced in appropriately.  the most recent comparable event is the subprime mortgage crash. many people thought bottom was hit around november 2008 and there was a brief counter-trend rally before actual bottom was hit around march 2009. we do not know at this time if the market has bottomed out yet or not  nor do we know how long recovery could take.

Does WHO recommend that all international mass gatherings be cancelled because of COVID-19?,"no. as each international mass gathering is different, the factors to consider when determining if the event should be cancelled may also differ. any decision to change a planned international gathering should be based on a careful assessment of the risks and how they can be managed, and the level of event planning. the assessment should involve all stakeholders in the event, and in particular the health authorities in the country or community where the event is due to take place. these authorities and stakeholders are in the best position to assess the level of stress the event might place on the local health system and emergency services - and whether this level of stress is acceptable in the current situation. it is who is view that all countries with community transmission should seriously consider postponing or reducing mass gatherings that bring people together and have the potential to amplify disease and support the recommended best practice of physical distancing. any decision will be supported through the use of who tools, in particular the risk assessment for mass gatherings during covid-19. if movement restrictions and further national measures have been established in the country, the who ra does not apply. however, when the process of re-opening/conducting mass gatherings is being considered post movement restrictions, it will be key to ensure any decisions are based on a risk assessment, such as the who mass gatherings covid-19 risk assessment.",75
"If I understand it right, the following steps are to be taken into account:


Taking the sample. -for the proposed method more samples would have to be taken.
Transporting the sample -more samples would have to be transported.
Testing -more material, would have to be tested, but less individual tests would have to be made.


So it seems, that 4 sub-questions can to be considdered to help answere.


What is the bottle neck in the testign process?
Does the amount of material needed to test for COVID-19 scale rather with the number of performed tests, or with the amount of tested material?
Does the amount of time needed to test for COVID-19 scale rather with the number of performed tests, or with the amount of tested material?
Is the the nucleic acid amplification test still reliable enough, if the Virus RNA to be detected is dilluded among multiple samples?


So far I have read a rather general account on how the tests are conducted https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2020/03/18/how-testing-for-covid-19-works.html
And I think I have a somewhat crude undersanding of how NAAT works.
","update apr 2: pooled tests are under development now  newspaper in german , the plan is to pool 5 samples and to use the usual amount of each sample  and presumably dilute less  so that sensitivity is not an issue.     in general, pooled tests help in screening situations, that is, when very few samples are positive, so that 10  samples can be pooled and still only a small fraction of pooled samples is positive. they require good sensitivity.   we are not in a screening situation with the current sars-cov-2 testing, and pooling would not help much right now - it would probably not be worth while the effort to develop and implment pooled tests.     long version:   update: deleted newspaper hints that logistics may be the bottleneck:     what is the bottle neck in the testign process    according to kekule  10 min or so into the interview  the  lab machinery  in germany has a capacity of several 100k tests per day, but right now there are shortages in reagents but also e.g. in the swabs for taking samples  so, comparably low tech parts of the test . pooled tests of course need just as many swabs  if not more: false negatives due to the sampling not picking up virus material is a concern, and the usual remedy is to take more swabs.     anything that comes now are my guesses as a professional from a neighbouring field: analytical chemistry . i do not have any first hand experience with pcr.     does the amount of material needed to test for covid-19 scale rather with the number of performed tests, or with the amount of tested material    i expect the reagent needs to scale  mostly  with the number of performed tests. i also expect the amount of tested material to be the same  prescribed by the method/protocol  for each run. that is, when you pool n samples, you would take only 1/n of material from each  in practice it may be better to pool and then take out 1/n of the pooled sample . update: the test described in the newspaper goes the opposite direction: they take n times the sample material in order to avoid trouble with low sensitivity. in consequence, this cannot be considered a  derived   variety  of the 1-sample tests, it must be newly developed almost from scratch.    does the amount of time needed to test for covid-19 scale rather with the number of performed tests, or with the amount of tested material    again: the tests, mor precisely the number of batches of tests since multiple tests can be processed in parallel.     is the the nucleic acid amplification test still reliable enough, if the virus rna to be detected is dilluded among multiple samples     from here on, we are back inside my professional experience   this i cannot answer since i do not know the typical concentration range of virus rna in the samples of positive cases.   the lowest concentration of virus rna that can reliably be detected is called the limit of detection  lod . in this context, reliably is 19 out of 20 validation samples at that concentration according to the emergency/ shortcut  validation procedure of the fda  i expect other parts of the world to have similar validation procedures right now . the rfda has a page with tests that have this emergency approval  http://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations covid19ivd , and the manufacturer information lists the lod.   one would relate the lower end of the typical concentration range to the lod to calculate how many samples could be pooled without the test becoming unreliable.  the linked news article hints that this may actually be a limiting factor. the test under development avoids this problem by using more sample material.    there is another limitation to how many samples one can sensibly pool. the aim of the procedure is to save tests. thus, we need to set up the pooling so that only a small proportion of pooled tests is positive and a large fraction of cases can be  closed  as negative.   here is the fraction of pooled samples that is positive depending on the prevalence   fraction of positive samples and the number of samples that are pooled n:     contours are every 10  points. dashed and dotted lines are the current fractions of positive samples for germany and italy.  from that, we can calculate how many samples we need to run  for every positive pooled sample, additional n tests  and from that the fraction of tests we save compared to testing each sample separately:    contours here are right to left: 0, 25  , 50   and 75    savings .  so, at the current testing situation in germany, pooling 4 samples would allow to save almost 60   of tests. in italy, pooling 3 samples would save less than 15   of tests.  a pooled test would need its own validation and one would also do some additional development to get the required sensitivity  lod  for the desired number of pooled samples, meaning more delay until pooled tests would be available.   in addition, pooled tests alongside the single tests that are anyways needed would mean additional logistic burden in the labs.   i do not think developing a pooled test would be worth while right now, the more so, as other measures would give similar or better relief:  doing only 1 test per household would save about 50   since the average size of a household in germany is 2 without the need of any new test development.  the same is true for further concentrating the tests on the vulnerable/high risk population.   thus, pooled tests may help in the containment phase when they would allow to test a larger number of possible contacts.   update: getting back into containment phase is the aim of the current lockdown.   we would still have high requirements for sensitivity and specificity. this means, pooled tests would have helped most right at the beginning of the epidemic - but they always mean additional r amp d and also additional validation needs to be done  and part of the validation work btw. must be done in every single lab that wants to use the test  since they need to be implemented in addition to the single sample method. this means, they will always be available only after the single sample method is established.

Is there any identified policy China is doing to succesfully reduce Coronavirus cases, the other countries arent using?
","containment  the most important factor is containment:   in the epicenter 60 million people were locked down. so if you can not leave your home you can not infect others nor get infected by others. across the country 780 million people were under travel restrictions. some areas only one family member is allowed to leave the home every 2 days to get supplies. community committees  non existent in most other countries  deliver food and check on condition of those locked down.   today china is changing into  targeted containment  where certain cities with no new cases for five days still have borders closed but allow citizens to now move freely within city borders.  some other considerations:   china is very nimble in setting up a 1,000 bed hospital in a week  16 were setup i believe . china was quick to develop a 15 minute test kit for novel coronavirus 2. this allows infected people to be quickly separated and allows those not infected to continue without undue fear or restrictions on work, school or family relations. by comparison us refused  for a week  to test people in a deadly infected washington state nursing home where at least 50 staff in inmates, um er residents, are showing symptoms. ct scans. when labs could no longer keep up to number of test samples, hospitals in china resorted to cat scans of the lungs as reported february 13th. there have been no reports in the media if us hospitals have ct scanning machines that doctors know how to read to classify a patient as  presumptive positive . there was mild upheaval when china included ct scan cases in their daily reports.     what  we  started doing march 8, 2020 similar to china  you do not say who  we  are but i presume it is eu / north america. from that point of view italy has just implemented a policy a little less strict than china today. the daily link contents will change tomorrow so i will include march 8, 2020  gmt  link contents here:    italy emergency measures    16 days after the beginning of the outbreak, the italian government  took decree today to take exceptional measures to contain about 16  million italians living in 14 provinces in the north of the

competitions are suspended with some exceptions     had the national restrictions been implimented a fortnight ago the lockdown may have been less severe today  march 8, 2020 .   also note like china, italy has been using the 15 minute test kit presumably backed up by the two to five day lab testing which they say is more accurate.    march 9, 2020 update  today italy expanded the  lockdown  to the entire nation of 60 million people. still it is not as targeted a restriction as china implemented against wuhan and the province it was in  circles of protection like linux kernel and user space tools .  today israel announced all people coming into the country must undergo 14 day quarantine. this would include all americans who historically have been the biggest supporters and creators of israel.  note israel is actions go above and beyond the steps china has taken. it more akin to the steps some regions took during the spanish flu of 1918. sorry direct link not available i recall researching this a few days / week ago.  although israel is using a stronger tactic than which china took two things have to be considered:   people were not swarming to get to china in february 2020 with usa declaring it persona non-grata in nation terms.  benjamin netenyahu is facing american style impeachment and might be using people and this growing pandemic as a  human shield  of sorts from his personal problems.   i think the 15 minute field test kit which takes blood sample was what made china successful but only they can answer that and the msm i have access to is not asking those questions to seek answers. currently schools are closing down in usa and other western countries because someone came back from an infected country without giving them a 15 minute field blood test first.    march 10, 2020 update  correction to yesterday  i read in haeratz  sp   newspaper online today that netenyahu exempted israeli is returning from america from the 14 day quarantine. i do not believe any science backs up the fact returning from a special mission to america exempts one from the coronavirus.  lab tests can fail too  alarmingly in japan someone infected on the princess cruise ship and then cleared for release was still infected because 15 minute blood test was not done, just the swab lab test. note the link is only valid for 24 hours then you have to scroll to march 10:    china developed the 15 minute field test kit on january 31, 2020 and an american company claims to have developed the same 15 minute field test kit. both are banned by the american cdc though because it measures those who have antibodies fighting the coronavirus  stage 1  and antibodies that have defeated the coronavirus  stage 2 . it does not test for the coronavirus itself.  if you know who has defeated the coronavirus and have antibodies they are the safest people to have assisting the at risk segment of the population. china nor any other country has said they are doing this though.  screening everyone crossing the land/air/sea border with a 15 minute test would go a long way to slowing down the virus spread. i hope the reason for not using the 15 minute test is not because there is not enough profit in it for labs. remember to date  our  labs have mostly test people who do not have the virus. with the 15 minute test kit they would be testing people who 90  odds do have the virus.  new rochelle new york state takes a page from china is play book  tomorrow the army is moving into new york according to aljazeera tv to seal off the city and not let anyone leave. plus they

one in ottawa canada playing fast  amp  loose, the one in edmonton canada erring on the side of caution.  everyone at work is worrying now. i wish we had the 15 minute field test kit so we can quickly separate the  suspected wheat  from the  suspected chaff . the good news is unlike the usa we can do tests on possible cases here in edmonton canada. tom hanks is also thankful today he could be tested in positive australia and was not in the usa would they would refuse to test him.  china is a surveillance state which can control social media and msm for sure. canada and usa could utilize the anti-terrorism network built a decade ago including no-fly lists and turn it into a  anti-coronavirus  network. another example of what  we  could be doing more like china using existing computer databases and surveillance tracking resources.  what alberta announced today  edmonton -- as part of a new aggressive measure to fight the coronavirus pandemic, alberta is cancelling all large gatherings and advising against international travel. furthermore the link states:    the province is advising albertans against travelling  internationally.     given the rapid spread of this virus, it is no longer possible to  assess health risks for the duration of the trip,  hinshaw said.    she is also recommending all albertans currently outside of canada to  self-isolate for 14 days after their trip.    hinshaw said the risk of contracting coronavirus in alberta has not  changed in the past 24 hours, but is concerned that international  travellers will continue to bring the disease into the province.   with only 23 confirmed cases alberta is taking early steps to contain the virus without overreacting. the next steps  if cases increase  would be to close beauty parlours, bars and restaurants but i am biased as i never frequent such establishments. also i would stop sending fire fighters to non-essential traffic accidents and paramedic responses to save them for well, fighting fires. random thought would be for alberta to have disposable surgical gloves at self-serve gas stations for patrons to don before grasping the nozzle to fill up the tank.  another possible step would be to begin skype  tvoip  talks with canadian military which has a base close to edmonton with feasibility of  drafting  canadian troops living there. the purpose is for embedding troops with edmonton peace officers and edmonton police in a combined  counter-coronavirus-force  under a central command and control.  why troops  it was what my first bus driver after work  i take four buses home after work and am concerned they will shut down in two to three weeks and i will have to buy a bicycle  said today:  i hope the banks do not run out of money. this led to a long explanation about fractional reserve banking, gold standard, four federal reserve central banks going bankrupt, currency generated digitally and how not enough real money exists. anyway more fire power is preferable to not enough when you need it. besides even if heavy weaponry is not needed you can always call it a drill and lets face it nato military does not see much  action  anyway and will enjoy the  call to arms  if nothing else.  staying on topic, there are no reports i have read that china took these steps and used the military but i  imagine  they would have.    march 14, 2020 update  getting downvotes so might have to end these  save the world who does not care q amp a  updates.  today italy announced:    italy is health system is overwhelmed:       we are close to the point of no return for intensive care beds in lombardy. we have 15 to 20 intensive care beds left. with 85 new  people entering icu every day and 2 or 3 leaving, we are close to the  point of no return.  there are no more ambulances  - lombardy welfare  councilor gallera added -  and therefore someone will have to wait  late in the evening.   source  732 patients are currently treated in  intensive care in lombardy, and 76 new deaths were reported in the  region today.  in bergamo,  deaths have quintupled from a week ago. there is a burial every half hour  said councilor for cemetery services giacomo  angeloni.  there are many elderly people at home with breathing  difficulties. they are not hospitalized because the hospitals are  full  said the mayor of alzano lombardo carmelo bertocchi.     what would china do   hard to say their society is different. what should italy do  easier to say if they are like canada.  temporarily suspend medical laws. commandeer white crew cab pickup trucks from dealers at cost plus twenty. paint red crosses on left and right. staff with four able-bodied young men. put a mattress in the box.  take that 80 person call center designed to rip off seniors with calls to support the fireman is burn unit and police feed the children fund. have them call people over 65 twice a day. if they do not answer send aforementioned four men in a pick up truck.  a week ago china would have build 1,000 bed hospitals that take a week to complete. nato countries should do the same a week before where italy is today. scrap white collar surveyors, architects and engineers. send in the blue collar labourers, concrete finishers, electricians, plumbers, skid steer operators, truck drivers, crane operators, foremen and carpenters with blue prints that china used.  spain is lockdown today should have exempted warehousing and transportation of food and drugs workers. they will think of that tomorrow.  president trump is test announced today seems like  fake news  if the test only works when upper respiratory tract is infected when a nasal swab is taken. however the kind of test taken was not announced.  china web guru is donated 500,000 test kits to usa today. no word if 100 labs and 1,000 lab workers are included to analyze test results...  i visited the world is second largest mall today. i noticed the indoor hockey rink was closed  like the nhl  i could fix that in a week i think   and replaced with a bead trinket / fake rock sales flea market. one vendor had a dry cough and another was wearing surgical gloves.  there was a sign outside the bathroom hallway from alberta health advising people how to wash hands. at galaxy land i saw a few amusement ride employees cleaning surfaces. so if they close all the schools here they end up in galaxy land   schools should stay open because teachers know their students better than a random ride attendant. however reinstate the old days where students queue when the first bell rings. then forehead point and shoot temperature checks will be done.  allergy season is arriving and probably 10  of the population is effected with running nose and sneezing. they should get a card or something to alleviate the fears of others on the bus or airplane.  people under 30 getting and recovering from bsc should be verified and coveted. being over 50 i am not really scared but i am worried i will infect that elderly man hobbling down the street today at -20c with his cane. my bus may be no safer for him than ets dats. which reminds me should not they be cleaning the buses here   callous individuals surround us and say  they are old  lets kill them all with the virus. forward thinkers will realize they will be old too someday. what would china do  i think they would  respect their elders .  gee jing ping  xi jingping  wore a mask and sat meters away from other officials when he announced wuhan  think washington dc  and wubie province  think washington state  had overcome the virus  we do not know that is true yet .  on the other hand trump and officials wore no ppe and all touched the mic in some sort of  speaking is more important than reality  press conference yesterday  friday the 13th .  if someone on the bus wears a mask do not freak out. they may be trying to protect you or chances are they are just scared. do not pick on them.  i have no idea if all of this transpired in china but their culture is different than nato is and we must adapt because the end results are what count. life, liberty and freedom can be mutually exclusive. for a few months you will have to give up freedom to save life. china did do that and appears to have succeeded today. what will history say about you     march 16, 2020 update  today canada announced closing borders to all foreign nationals except us citizens. what would china do    about two weeks ago the border to washington state would have been sealed off. because people there flow into b.c. the alberta / bc border would have been sealed off.   what to do today to mimic china    100 million people live beside the us / canada border. they like to make day trips to mimic currency arbitrage and buy goods cheaper in other country. this traffic should be shut down. canadian health care is free, americans in past have utilized that system, that should be shut down. everyone crossing border by land should be subject to 5 second forehead temperature check with  60 gun. those with fever must seek medical attention. some border crossing like edmundston new brunswick and madawaska, me, united states are like their own little country. they can manage their own laws and have to worry about keeping outsiders out of both towns.   china succeeded at first locking down wuhan city and then hubie province. italy tried that and failed. canada / us appears headed for even bigger failure thinking it will save the economy. perhaps it will in the short term but more long term planning is still needed:   airlines will ask for bailouts. tell them to go bankrupt and create new startups in a couple of years. edmonton schools are closing for six months. send teachers out to work for four months even if it is sanitizing buses. after all you are making parents leave work to child care and still expect them to pay 12 months of school taxes right  it is proposed to pay people unemployment.  800 every two weeks might be fine for 80  of the population but an airline pilot can not live on that if his mortgage and car payments are more than that per month. do not give the money to company ceos that lay off all the workers in order to support stock price. accept the fact great depression can be approaching and learn from those mistakes. people to plan to fail, they fail to plan - like with usa test kits. communism at  20/hour is better than capitalism with chance for  200/hr. when reality is  0/hr. no word if china will revert back to communism but their journey is shorter than canada is would be and especially america is. my bus driver was in a state of shock an hour ago as she was told tomorrow buses would be running on saturday schedule which means that bus would not be running. the city bus website had no information on this. do not make such knee-jerk reactions wait a week even if buses are 25  of capacity before making such announcements. city of edmonton website said one employee returning from vacation tested positive but it was not related to recreational facility or other services closing today. makes me think it is swimming pool and wonders why they refuse to say  border closing by canada and saying 14 self-isolation for all arriving  except us citizens who are immune to sars 2.0 apparently  me they are math challenged. worldometers.com states some claim incubation period of 2 to 14 days with 5.2 days mean time which is what they are getting 14 from. others say 0 to 28 days but that is not the point. they should have said if you are arrived from italy, egypt, france, germany, washington state, cruise ship or blah blah 13 days ago then self isolate for 1 day, if 12 days ago then self isolate for 2 days, etc etc up to today arrivals isolate for 14 days. no mention if doctors will be trained how to read ct scan of lungs. no mention if blood test to measure sars 2.0 anti-bodies will be done. criminal negligence almost not learning what china learned and shared with the world. also consider giving bus drivers temperature guns so i can get my temperature checked twice a day too and self-isolate if necessary. then call dispatch for mini-bus making circles picking feverish people up to pick them up. travel by planes offer and border crossings offer great chances to take 5 second temperature check but you need to think out of the box sometimes. research a few weeks ago revealed only 100 icu beds in edmonton and ventilators can not be ordered over night but temperature guns can be ordered over night... they warned us weeks ago to get 14 day supply and i did. today doug ford of ontario told people to stop buying and  hoarding . make up your mind...   final thoughts for what china would do   they would lift sanctions against the people of syria and iran who suffered enough already in usa bid to cause social unrest due to mass human suffering.  indeed sanctions against iran and syria in the first place, china would have voted down if such a measure was introduced in the united nations security council. we can only imagine how decapitated the hospitals in northern parts of syria are now with white helmets running amok to make oscar award winning videos backed by the guns of isis. witnessing the lies of test kits and extrapolating to other lies like white helmets things begin to make sense. would you like a cup of karma with your reality check   crisis can be an opportunity for change and we can watch how china handles it and hopefully treat them as a three month indication to the future of covidi-9.  rt reported that china sent medical experts and supplies to italy after the eu denied support.  edmonton closed schools today but high school kids were still traveling in buses and associating in groups. it does little good to close schools and still allow kids to associate. china locked down homes and anyone traveling had to produce national id cards. there are no national id cards in canada, my only cards are a debit card and library card  closed in edmonton as of today . i also carry a bus pass which might have limited value starting tomorrow...  op is valid question what did china do is almost totally ignored by the media here whilst usa tries to steal vaccines from other nations to make a fast buck for trump. lets make this clear if and when a vaccine is create dit belongs to bsc  bat sourced coronavirus  owner in china who gives it away to the world for free. no patents. no arguments. that said sars 1.0 vaccine was 13 years in the making before being scrapped in 2016. the world has to stop focusing on maybe is and deal with reality that changes by the hour and is unique to every region and the resources they have in play.  this reminds me of inventory control training at work where last week he had to reverse adjustments to stock so this week he has to do the same thing for a different sku. wrong. it is on a case by case basis and every case is different. open your universities 24/7 to develop a vaccine and analyze all those drive through test samples sure. closing them is about the worst thing you could have done with available resources...  where are the flight manifests of everyone who arrived from italy, germany and the netherlands over the last 30 days  were they given to the city of edmonton police  real judges have subpoena powers. it is great you closed bs family court with he-said she-said soap opera now lets get the real judges and real law enforcement working. politicians with silver spoons including trudeau  amp  trump have no idea of how the real world works.  china and korea  both republic and democratic sides  seem to have their act together. as does new zealand one of the  five eyes  which seems to have had their eye open. putin and netenyahu seem more concerned with political extensions. trump saw a picture of him photo-shopped image playing the violin and tweeted he likes it whilst completely oblivious to the reference  nero fiddled while rome burned . the media is devoting too much attention to politicians and not doing investigative journalism. four words  fifteen minute blood test. since you have ten fingers three more  border temperature checks.  what would china do   i imagine by now they would have tracked down all the people that have been to  life care   oxymoron  nursing home in washington usa and lynn valley nursing home in north vancouver, canada  been there seen that . no word on if usa and canada have done that yet     also no word from investigative journalists interviewing  health care professionals  on if they travel between nursing homes because they are  specialists    finally on saturday march 14, 2020 apple closed all it is stores outside of china and reopened them inside china. i visited west edmonton mall and sure enough the store was closed with 4 blue t-shirt clad employees outside closed doors and i said  so it is true   what tim cook said . investigative journalists be asking themselves what tech companies knew before their governments did. look how facebook and google closed down events a week or fortnight before your governments did. ask yourself the 5w is and sometimes how     march 17, 2020  happy st. patrick is day. plans to go out tonight got cancelled because alberta declared a state of emergency.  guy at work was sent home for coughing because  it is not safe .

Is there a particular blood group more prone to Covid-19?,"there may be a chance some blood types have a higher risk of getting a serious dose of covid-19 than others, a small early study suggests.  researchers assessed 2,173 coronavirus hospital patients in shenzhen and wuhan in china, where the outbreak originated.  they found patients with a blood group types were more likely to have been hospitalised than average, while those with an o blood group type were less likely.  in the local population, 32  had a type a blood group, compared with 38  of those in hospital. meanwhile, 34  of residents had type 0 blood, compared with 26  in hospital.  however, this study has not yet been peer reviewed and only covered a small area, so these links may be coincidental. everyone should be doing all they can to avoid catching the virus and passing it on to others, regardless of their blood type.",94
"Background:
I hold citizenship of a country included in the Exchange Visitor Skill list for J1 visa holders (my research area, biological sciences, is on the list as well). My postdoc project is funded by NIH/NSF grants to the lab (not in a university). I completed a Ph.D. in a major US university last year, and my work authorization is under the F1 OPT. In light of diminishing faculty openings, I do not have a strong preference for staying in academia long term.

Details:
I started my current (and first) postdoc position a few months back, and this position is funded for the next few years. My advisor has been great, and she is supportive. I am also satisfied with the progress being made in the project. 

Due to the increased visa denials, I was advised to wait for the next visa and not leave the US during the OPT period. The HR informed me that J1 is the only option as per the organization policy, and my advisor is powerless even if she wants to help. I did not know that non-University entities could sponsor J1 and thought H1B was the only choice (a significant reason for choosing this position; my bad.) 

If I take J1, I will be subject to the two year home residency rule (which is the worst; the economy in my home country (a banana republic) is in shambles). Being on OPT would make it extremely risky to leave the US, and the status of the OPT STEM extension is uncertain. These factors make me want to look for new opportunities with H1B sponsorship. However, the fact that my advisor has been supportive and having to leave after a few months without any publication makes me feel incredibly guilty. I would appreciate perspectives on this issue.
","being a postdoc is a job. you are not a slave for academia, nor is your reasearch so important  no offense  that you have to continue it no matter what happens to your life.  nobody is research is.    you are a professional and should act as such. there is nothing to be guilty about. any reasonable person knows and understands that there are reasons which end one is participation in a project even if there is no  outcome  of the project. probably your supervisor would feel more guilty if you feel the need to stay just because of them.  i do not mean to be harsh -- it is only human to feel guilty about such things. what would you do if your were the supervisor  talk about your feelings with your friends -- emotional questions like this are better discussed with trusted people than on the internet.   just for completeness, given the recent situation: if you were an absolute key person in the research of coronavirus and countermeasures, maybe it could be argued that you should stay until you transferred all your knowledge.

"As it commonly known, mutability is a fundamental characteristic of viruses which presents the ability of virus genome to adapt to physical circumstances, prevent and circumvent vaccine effect and to cover more ranges of carriers, animals and people categories.

COVID-19 belongs to RNA-viruses family, and RNA viruses is known to be very mutable, but how much this is true for COVID-19? How much in comparison with other viruses? I didn't found any reliable researches in this field except this expatiative article from EpiVax.



According to their research, this virus has little-to-zero T-epitopes cross-conservation which makes it very difficult to build a vaccine. Am I right?

"If I'm wearing a mask and someone sneezes on me, would the mask offer some protection?","yes. but only if you use the mask properly and do not touch it with your hands afterward. those droplets from a cough or sneeze would hit your mask instead of your mouth and nose -- good news. but the next step is to take the mask off by the ear bands and either wash or discard it -- without touching the front of it.  that is what i see all the time,  says griffin.  that is why in the studies, masks fail -- people do not use them  correctly . they touch the front of it. they adjust it. they push it down somehow to get their nose stuck out.  if you touch the front of the mask, whatever that person coughed or sneezed on it is now on your hands. as this video from the world health organization shows, you should take off your mask by removing the elastics or straps from behind your ears. do not touch the front, and keep the mask away from your face. one other thing: ideally you would have eye protection, too, to keep that stranger is sneeze from getting in. glasses and sunglasses are not perfect but can help.",16

Why is the US so far behind other countries with testing?,"experts say it is due to cuts in federal funding for public health and problems with early testing.   problems with public health infrastructure two years ago, the cdc stopped funding epidemic prevention activities in 39 countries, including china. this happened because the trump administration refused to allocate money to a program that started during the 2014 ebola outbreak.   former cdc director dr. tom frieden warned that move  would significantly increase the chance an epidemic will spread without our knowledge and endanger lives in our country and around the world.   problems with the testing malfunctions, shortages and delays in availability have all contributed to the slowdown.   in the first few weeks of the outbreak in the us, the cdc was the only facility in the country that could confirm test results -- even though a world health organization test became available around the same time.   some test kits that were sent around the country were flawed -- a move that put the us behind about  four to five weeks,  says dr. rob davidson, executive director of the committee to protect medicare.",24

","i cannot make medical recommendations, since i am not a vet, but as pet-owner during covid-19 pandemic lockdown i suggest you call your vet is office. i was able to get a routine prescription over the telephone from my vet. my cat had been seen at the clinic last fall. since he is still growing, i had to weigh him on the bathroom scales so the vet could prescribe the right doze. another time, i called for medical advice that the person at the front desk was able to answer.   all this makes me think it might be worth giving your vet is office a call to ask for advice, since the vet seems to know your cat.

Is COVID-19 airborne?,"the virus that causes covid-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. these droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. they quickly fall on floors or surfaces. you can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within 1 metre of a person who has covid-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before washing your hands.",31
"To preface this, I'm not a supporter of Trump, but I disagree with the way some major media outlets have criticized him over his nickname for COVID-19, the ""Chinese virus"".   In addition, it is not only those outlets, but other governmental organizations like the WHO that have advised against dubbing COVID-19 in such a manner.

In the past we have had cases where a widespread global epidemic has also been referred to other countries or nationalities, such as:


The ""Spanish Flu"", although it should be known that the Spanish flu had origins little to do with Spain itself.
The ""Russian Flu"" or ""Asiatic Flu""
The Japanese Smallpox Epidemic
The Asian Flu and the Hong Kong Flu
The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which has been referred to as Saudi Arabia's SARS-like virus.


In any case, is the media backlash over Trump's nickname for COVID-19 justifiably warranted? Is there a problem in the way COVID-19 has been nicknamed?
","let is appreciate the learning curve. the problem with all of those historical names is that they created sharp spikes in prejudice, social ostracism, and violence against the indicated groups, and still create issues today as seen here with covid-19. it is true that the first identified cases of covid-19 occurred in wuhan china, but this does not imply that people of chinese descent -- or even people recently emigrated from china -- are vectors for the disease, or in any way responsible for the problems that the disease causes. but in the minds of an unfortunate number of ignorant people, the mere association of the disease with chinese heritage can produce verbal and physical assaults, and/or other social pressures that can prevent chinese people in any walk of life from getting access to necessities or essential services.   trump is very public insistence on calling this the  chinese virus , backed by his status as president, is guaranteed to significantly increase acts of discrimination and assault on people of asian descent  whether or not they are specifically chinese . it guarantees this merely by giving an authoritative affirmation to the most panicked, emotional, and ignorant portion of our society that those  chinese  are in some way responsible for the spread of covid-19.  no doubt trump does this intentionally. trump thrives on the panicked, angry ignorance of others  that emotional state he knows how to manipulate to his own profit. and while he himself may not be concerned with the secondary impact of increased violence against people of asian descent, people of asian descent have a good deal to worry about.  a president ought to have the presence of mind not to inflame racial tensions in a situation where tensions are already running exceedingly high. even if we wanted to argue that there is nothing terribly wrong with the phrasing in and of itself -- that it is just a poor choice of words by a man whom no one considers to be eloquent, perhaps -- misstatements by someone who is  ostensibly  the leader of the free world have significant consequences. if even one asian american gets attacked because of someone emboldened by trump is poor word choice, that is blood on trump is hands.

I was waiting with bated breath for the CDC update on cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. by date of onset.  To my eyes this looks like absolutely wonderful news - that it means that the exponential growth of the virus has been ""flattened"" - but I'm still afraid I may be misinterpreting what I see.  It bothers me that the headline for the graph hasn't changed.  But it APPEARS that the number of new cases stopped increasing after 3/3.  Am I missing something?

Top: before noon on 3/16, bottom: after noon on 3/16.  Data from https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html

Note: In today's update (the first in three days) the CDC page shows the number of cases with onset on 3/4 to be 159, and 3/9 is 307.  This doubled in five days rather than every two or three as other numbers would suggest, but given the dramatic changes in this curve, and their overall direction, I think the top answer below has been vindicated.
","the information you show is meaningless unless it is also accompanied by the number of tests performed. if the cdc tested 2 people and got two positive results, that does not tell us anything at all about the actual rate of infection. and, indeed, the cdc has been testing a shockingly low number of cases:         data during this period are incomplete because of the lag in time between when specimens are accessioned, testing is performed, and results are reported.    image source   the last day they give data for, 2020-03-15, includes 0 samples from the cdc and 4 samples from other public health labs. since only 4 samples are represented in the chart, of course we see a drop in cases, but that is because they are based on only 4 tests. as more tests for those dates and subsequent dates are reported, the numbers will change.  date collected cdc labs us public health labs 3/12 75   2302   3/13 0   1511   3/14 0   165   3/15 0   4     as you can see in the table above  from the same source as the graph , the past few days have seen almost no tests are being included in this analysis either from the cdc or elsewhere, so any drop in cases is completely meaningless.

"My first question is that most sources say to contact doctor regarding tests if you have “shortness of breath”, but as a Asthma patient this is not uncommon for me. Also runny nose is common. So how would an Asthma patient discern Covid19 from regular symptoms, only fever?
","there are apps to help you distinguish covid-19 versus other diseases so in your question your mention a runny nose which is a rare or infrequent manifestation of covid-19.  shortness of breath is a more advanced symptom than cough whereas in asthma shortness of breath is usual.  furthermore shortness of breath in asthma is due to reversible narrowing of small airways so that should respond to usual bronchodilator medication. but the shortness of breath in covid-19 is at the alveolar level beyond the small airways and will not be helped by bronchodilator therapy.  in short, if an asthma patient has shortness of breath, fever, and cough where the shortness of breath does not respond to bronchodilator therapy, then in the context of the current covid-19 pandemic there is a high probability that this is covid-19 disease.

"Should I wear a face mask in public? If so, how do I make one?","the cdc recently changed its guidance on wearing face masks as more studies about asymptomatic spread pile up.  now, the cdc  recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain  e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies .   but there are several important caveats and key points:     the public should not buy surgical masks or n95 respirator masks. those are desperately needed by health care workers who are in close contact with coronavirus patients every day.   instead, make your own cloth mask -- it is easy, and you do not have to sew. us surgeon general jerome adams shows how to make face masks with just a t-shirt and rubber bands in this cdc video. you can also use a bandana and a coffee filter.   do not be fooled: the main benefit of wearing masks in public is not to protect you from getting sick. rather, it is to protect others from yourself if you are sick or you are an asymptomatic carrier.  this is more for people who might be infected and do not know it, and to try and lower the likelihood that they will spread this to somebody else,  cnn chief medical correspondent dr. sanjay gupta said. the cdc agreed.  you can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask. the virus can stay alive on surfaces for up to 3 days, and it is easy to touch your face whenever you are not wearing a mask. also, people often adjust face masks frequently, leading to more touching of the face -- a common way that coronavirus spreads.  it is important to wash your cloth mask after every use. here is how.   wearing cloth masks is just  an additional, voluntary public health measure,  the cdc said. to protect yourself from getting coronavirus, it is critical to stay 6 feet away from others, wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds each time, and stop touching your face.",16
"According to Reuters news agency, the Director General of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference today (March 11th) that:


  We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and
  severity and by the alarming levels of inaction. We have therefore
  made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic,


The same article, however, cites unnamed WHO officials as saying that the term ""pandemic"" is just a descriptive word and does not carry any legal significance.

What significance, if any, does the characterisation that has been made today have?
","very little, practically speaking.  from the who:     describing the situation as a pandemic does not change who is assessment of the threat posed by this  coronavirus. it does not change what who is doing, and it does not change what countries should do -   drtedros   as discussed in this q amp a, the definition of  pandemic  is fairly arbitrary. it does identify this virus, both in the present day and in history, as particularly significant, but there is nothing magical that changes with this definition from a political  or epidemiological  perspective, and there appear to be no particular political consequences of the definition from the who is perspective.  that is, there are no special funds or protocols that are activated by declaring a  pandemic  the way you might expect for various  declarations of emergency , which often activate laws that change regulations and procedures during the emergency and may allow for release of funds marked for that purpose.  from the content of the announcement, it seems like the who is primary goal in making this declaration is to reiterate the severity of the situation rather than to mark any particular milestone or to alter any guidance or recommendations.

"In response to the rapidly spreading coronavirus, Germany has enacted a general ""ban on contact"", effective starting today (Monday, 2020-03-23). It prohibits any gathering of more than two people in public and private spaces, except if they live in the same household.

What I am very unclear about is the extent to which certain behaviours are restricted by this regulation, as coverage in news is IMHO extremely unclear.

For instance, Berliner Morgenpost says:


  Gruppen feiernder Menschen auf öffentlichen Plätzen, in Wohnungen sowie privaten Einrichtungen sind angesichts der ernsten Lage in unserem Land inakzeptabel.


In English:


  Groups of partying people in public spaces, in apartments, as well as private facilities are inacceptable due to the serious situation in our country.


Tagesschau says:


  Gruppen feiernder Menschen - auch im Privaten - sind inakzeptabel


In English:


  Groups of celebrating people - also in private - are inacceptable


And Merkur.de says:


  „Gruppen feiernder Menschen sind inakzeptabel“, erklärten die Politiker unisono. Jegliche Feierlichkeiten sind untersagt, das gilt auch für Geburtstage.


In English:


  ""Groups of celebrating people are inacceptable."", the politicians explained in unison. Any kind of celebrations are prohibited, this includes birthdays.


Now, what does this mean? At least some of the above statements can be interpreted in such a way that it's about the physically close group aspect. That is, celebrations whose participants meet in person in the same place are prohibited.

But then, all of those statements, and definitely the last one, also sound a lot like it's the very activity of celebrating that is prohibited, presumably because the ""serious situation in our country"" makes such a behaviour unbecoming. Thus, it sounds like restrictions similar to the Tanzverbot (that declare various overtly joyful activities to be unbecoming and thus unlawful on certain holidays) are in place.

Which interpretation is correct?


Am I violating the newly imposed restrictions if I meet with some of my friends (each of which is sitting at home alone, or at most with their families) via videochat and ""celebrate"" (whatever is meant by that, let's count any joyful or relaxing leisure activity) with them online to brace against the effects of social isolation and cabin fever?
And does it mean we cannot let our children have a joyful videochat with their friends whom they already cannot meet in person due to the closure of schools and child nurseries?

","what most of your quotes are based on is this general consensus reached by the federal and state governments on how to proceed. the actually legal implementation happens on the state level in form of decrees. therefore, the quoted texts are not to be taken as legal text, but human-readable1. in particular they are not to be taken painstakingly literal, but context and common sense may be applied2.  the actual decrees are much more specific and clear. for example, let is take the decree for northrhine-westphalia  translation mine :    ss 11 veranstaltungen, versammlungen, gottesdienste, beerdigungen     1  veranstaltungen und versammlungen sind untersagt. ausgenommen sind  ...     ss 12 ansammlungen, aufenthalt im offentlichen raum     1  zusammenkunfte und ansammlungen in der offentlichkeit von mehr als 2 personen sind untersagt. ausgenommen sind  ...         ss 11 events, gatherings, religious services, funerals     1  events and gatherings are forbidden. exempt are  ...     ss 12 gatherings and presence in public space     1  congregations and gatherings of more than two persons in public are forbidden. exempt from this are  ...    most of this is clearly about in-person meetings. the only exception is the term  veranstaltung   event , which could be construed to cover online events. however, in other laws using this term, it clearly refers to in-person events. for example parts of this law governing the number of toilets available at an event do not make any sense for online events.  i see nothing in the decree that would forbid online celebrations. in fact celebrations are not mentioned at all  and are covered by more general terms in the degree, as far as they are in-person .     1 to be fair, the actual legal texts are not that bad in terms in human readability either. 2 mind that i do not wish to accuse you of lacking common sense here. after all the consensus dissonating with your common sense made you ask this question.

  On March 16, 2020, amid an economic crisis caused by the 2020
  coronavirus pandemic, for the first time since the inception of the

  0%.[11]


Now question is why would banks not approve a loan? Worst case they get 0 $ back, but that does not mean that they lost money since credit was created out of thin air so even if every credit defaults they still will not loose any money and anything they get back is pure profit.

note:for simplification this assumes that cost of processing a loan is 0% for bank, we know that realistically they need to pay their employees.
","  worst case they get 0   back, but that does not mean that they lost money since credit was created out of thin air so even if every credit defaults they still will not loose any money and anything they get back is pure profit.   obviously if a bank never lost money by not getting paid back they would make loans all day long, even ones they knew they would not get paid back on.  but the fact of the matter is, a bank is profits are based on how much they actually make on the loan beyond the cost of the loan itself. the cost of the loan includes the principle which must be paid back. what you refer to as being created  out of thin air  does not mean that money is being created from nothing, it is referring to the fact that the same money can be loaned out multiple times, effectively creating what appears to be actual money several times in excess of the actual amount of money floating around.  another way of looking at it is that a bank generally is not lending its own money. they get the money from other sources and lend it out at higher rates than they pay, and from the excess the pay their expenses and hopefully have some profits left over. so if you put  100 in an account at the bank, the bank can lend that  100 out and earn interest on the money, but at the end of the day, they still owe you  100 on demand whenever you ask for it. the  created out of thin air  comes from the fact that the person who lends the money will need to put the money somewhere, most likely either the same or a different bank, or if they use the money to pay somebody else, that person most likely will deposit the same money in the bank, so ultimately, most of the money they lend out stays in the banking system where it can be lent out again.  the fractional reserve requirement just states how much of that money can be lent out again in the aggregate. a 0  reserve requirement basically means the bank can lend it all out again. it does not mean that they will be able to  only so much money in loans is being sought at any given time  nor does it reduce the fiduciary requirements to make good loans that are likely to get paid back.

"I had a flight ticket from Madrid (MAD, Spain) to Miami (MIA, US) to fly in March with AirEuropa. I got an email saying the flight was cancelled 13 days and 21 hours before the flight. Am I eligible to get a cash refund? Am I entitled to further compensation?

The flight was cancelled the day after Donald Trump forbade the entrance of non-residents to the US because of COVID-19.

The answer from an AirEuropa agent is no, I am not. They offer a voucher that has to be spent within 2020, which IMO is very limited.

As I understand the EU rules, I can choose to get a refund unless the carrier can prove the cancellation was because of extraordinary circumstances. I guess COVID-19 is extraordinary, but Trump did not forbid flights to the US, but the entrance of some people, so AirEuropa could have flown that day.
","under eu rules you always get a refund. the extraordinary circumstances only mean that they do not have to pay any additional compensation. so far for the legal side.  their homepage does only offer vouchers, though. the reason is likely that they want to hold on to the cash - espececially since they are not selling any new tickets right now.  scenario one is that they do it because they are not customer-friendly and they assume that only a fraction of the passengers will fight for their money. scenario two is that they do not have the money to refund everyone and do not want to go bust.  my guess is that they are likely to fight any claim for monetary refunds. basically your options are to take the voucher  hoping they will still be around when you want to use it , or to fight for a refund.

"I adopted two middle-aged (or older?) cats from the same shelter 3.5 years ago.  Both were healthy until recently when one developed FIP.  Since I adopted them they have had no contact with other cats, aside from whatever happens behind the scenes at the vet's office.

According to this article from the Cornell Veterinary School, a cat can be exposed to the virus (with no symptoms) and develop FIP years later.  So it sounds like it's possible that my cat came to me already infected and the disease only manifested now.  (It's also possible that the other cat is a carrier who transmitted it to him without getting sick himself.)

When is a cat with future-FIP infectious?  Only during an initial exposure to coronavirus (when my cat caught this), or from that time onward?  Only after developing FIP?  If a cat has been exposed to coronavirus in the past but has never shown symptoms of FIP, can he transmit that coronavirus to other cats?

I am trying to figure out the effect of this on my remaining cat, and whether I can safely adopt another cat to join him.  There is no reliable test for FIP other than biopsies, so at best testing can tell us if he's been exposed to coronavirus (the test looks for the antibodies). But my biggest concern is whether he could be infectious.  (If he's also infected then, sadly, there's nothing we can do about that.  We can only test for coronavirus and coronavirus doesn't always lead to FIP from what I've read.)
","veterinary partner is a very reliable website that should be able to answer your questions on fip  your cat wont get fip by being with an fip   cat, it can however contract coronavirus. and yes as you mentioned, not all coronavirus cats will develop fip.  from my  common diseases of companion animals  textbook:    80  to 90  of cats in catteries have antibodies to fecv and these cats shed virus intermittently.   that being said by continuously disinfecting and only having one/two cat s  in your home you can eventually clear out fecv  most common household disinfectants work .  you can check your current cat what his current anti-body levels are for coronavirus if you are concerned about a new cat coming in as well.  an excerpt from veterinary partner on fecv:    an active infection lasts several weeks to a few months. virus is shed in the infected cat is stool during this period. if the cat is reinfected, virus sheds again for weeks to months. during this time, the cat may or may not seems at all ill. some infected cats do not shed virus.    the mutation to a form of virus that can cause fip is more likely to occur in an immune-compromised cat. most cats with fip are less than one year old  their immaturity is their immune compromise . crowding is also an important source of immune-compromise. another important factor in mutation is multiple exposure/infections. when cats keep getting reinfected, the virus they carry has more chance of mutating to a form that causes fip.   i have only seen 3 cases of fip in almost 4 years in practice, it is not very common.

"So far it appears that Western countries especially in Europe (e.g. Italy, Spain, UK, France, Germany) struggle to curb the spread of COVID-19. This is in contrast to most Asian countries (China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore) which were hit by the virus earlier, but managed to reduce the contagion through drastic containment measures.

While it's probably too soon to evaluate the effect of the strong measures which have been implemented in the past few days in many European countries, it looks as if Western countries have been reluctant and/or unable and/or inefficient at implementing the methods used in Asia to fight the contagion. It also looks as if Asian countries are expected to be more disciplined and/or organized than Western countries (example).

","part of it is going to be that the region  hk, singapore, sk , china  was hit much harder during the 2003 sars epidemic so spent more time getting prepared.  also, it has long been the expectation that the next epidemic would come out of china, both due to population density and proximity to livestock/wild animals, so those countries could expect another  gift  from their chinese neighbors.  japan  it is relatively unscathed so far, but it is an isolated island, with comparatively few foreigners which is not on great terms with its asian neighbors. as  bobsburner mentioned,  travel density  counts for a great deal with covid-19. for now - counting it as luck, might become skill later. or its success might just be down to not-testing, as  steros says.  supply chains are in asia. this is being shown as an achilles  heel of western service-oriented economies: if we need to ramp production of electronic testing kits or ventilators, we are cut off from a lot of the world is manufacturing capacity.  collectivism vs. individualism has a part to play in it as well: it is more difficult for a western politician to push drastic measures like quarantine  let alone china is dictatorial system . still, italy was pretty quick to do so, because they had no choice. still, the cultural traits leading to quick acceptance by the community of harsh limitations on individual liberties seems to be an asian advantage at this point:  here is a medical sciences stack exchange answer re. isolation, testing and surveillance procedures followed in guangdong, near hk, so not wuhan at all. an article partly covering wuhan itself. and we have heard of the one-week hospitals. we are just not there yet, in terms of mobilization. or coercion.  constant deficit spending. a country like italy is at 130   gdp debt. they have resisted pressure to shape up their finances, tax collection, pension payments, etc... for decades. they just do not have anything left to surge spending in emergencies. this applies to just too many european economies.  it is also really too early to say much about the final outcome. currently south korea and china are better at getting the disease under control, but what really counts is the long run. if a few dozen people in wuhan spread the disease rapidly in january then we need to be ready to wait this out for a while -  social distancing  amp  quarantines  for 3 months, then relaxing will result in restarted epidemics.  there is also, esp. at the start, plain luck. the 2003 sars epidemic hit canada is west coast less than toronto, because a doctor got bad vibes about a patient with breathing problems and she isolated them, before any outbreak was known. in toronto the same type of cases mingled with the general hospital staff and patients and the outbreak was much worse. in italy 1 covid case was not identified as such and went to the hospital 4 times, interacting with everyone else. s. korea had a massive cluster early on, but it was within a religious sect, which might interact less with others.  it is hard to really assign a  good vs bad  label to early spread. past that, the quality of political leaders and their ability to balance out economic/social reality vs medical advice  which is still operating in uncertainty - witness the uk is  herd  approach  is going to be key. this is a good time to be listening to experts, and there some of the asian technocrats are a definite better bet than some of the west is populists. i know i would not be thrilled to have duterte in the philippines in charge, for example, and he is asian.  rather than competition and comparisons, it might be useful to see what has been achieved so far: to some extent s. korea and china have shown that aggressive testing and quarantines can slow the disease, australia was very quick to sequence the bug is genome, we got a test within weeks  and some western countries are starting to look at and evaluate candidate vaccines. we are much better off in 2020 than if sars had had that kind of punch in 2003.

","with the right keywords  and author searches  from earlier papers, i actually found some academic output already  this might not be peer-reviewed yet, i.e. preprints:   mckibbin and fernando  2 march 2020  the global macroeconomic impacts of covid-19: seven scenarios    examines the impacts of different scenarios on macroeconomic outcomes and  financial markets in a global hybrid dsge/cge general equilibrium model.  the scenarios in this paper demonstrate that even a contained outbreak could significantly  impact the global economy in the short run.  ...   these results are very sensitive to the assumptions in the model, to the shocks we feed in and  to the assumed macroeconomic policy responses in each country.  and that is already cited by wang et al. covid-19 is impact on china is economy based on data of spring festival travel rush    this paper starts with the analysis of the daily railway passenger volume data during the spring festival travel rush, and establishes three time series to model the railway passenger volume, gdp in the first quarter model, and gdp in the last three quarters respectively. the forecast results indicate that:  a  affected by the epidemic, china is economy will lose 4.8 trillion yuan in the first quarter of 2020, which is an expected decrease of 20.69  and a year-on-year drop of 15.60    b  china is expected gdp growth rate for the full year of 2020 will reduce from 6.50  to 1.72 . however, there are some positive factors not taken into account in these models, which means that the forecast results may be underestimated. with the global spread of the epidemic, the instability of the world economy will in turn impact china is economy.  a more recent  march 30  paper, greenstone and nigam that emphasizes/quantifies the benefits of the lockdowns, in the us:    using the ferguson et al.  2020  simulation model of covid-19 is spread and mortality impacts in the united states, we project that 3-4 months of moderate distancing beginning in late march 2020 would save 1.7 million lives by october 1. of the lives saved, 630,000 are due to avoided overwhelming of hospital intensive care units. using the projected age-specific reductions in death and age-varying estimates of the united states government is value of a statistical life, we find that the mortality benefits of social distancing are about   8 trillion or  60,000 per us household. roughly 90  of the monetized benefits are projected to accrue to people age 50 or older. overall, the analysis suggests that social distancing initiatives and policies in response to the covid-19 epidemic have substantial economic benefits.      jp morgan has put out some estimates already, although they do not detail their methodology as much as a peer-reviewed publication would  have to .    the u.s. economy is projected to contract by 14  in the second quarter, after experiencing a 4  contraction in the first quarter, before recovering to 8  and 4  growth in the third and fourth quarters. euro area gdp will suffer an even deeper contraction, with double-digit declines of 15  and 22  in the first and second quarters, before rebounding by 45  and 3.5  in the third and fourth quarters.     there is no longer doubt that the longest global expansion on record will end this quarter. we now think that the covid-19 shock will produce a global recession, as nearly all of the world contracts over the three months between february and april,  said bruce kasman, chief economist at j.p. morgan. initially, the expectation was the novel-recession may generate limited labor market damage, but j.p. morgan research is now forecasting the unemployment rate for developed markets as a whole will rise 1.6 percentage points in the next two quarters.     the rise in unemployment will be sharper in the u.s. than in the euro area. most immediately, u.s. initial jobless claims should spike above 400,000 in the coming weeks,  said michael feroli, chief u.s. economist at j.p. morgan.   mckinsey has a somewhat spread-out  march 25  presentation, but a couple of slides with their scenarios/estimates i could fish from there:     likewise, pwc has a march  white paper mostly focused on australia... but which does come with a global map attached of their estimates of gdp losses, alas in absolute figures only  and i think over one year based on what they say on the previous slide :      before the covid-19 outbreak, there has been a niche academic domain of estimating the economic impact of pandemics already, typically using a cge model. results depend of course on the assumptions used. e.g. smith, keogh-brown et al. had a series of papers approximately a decade ago. quoting from a later one that covered more than one european country:    results suggest gdp losses from the disease of approximately 0.5-2  but school closure and prophylactic absenteeism more than triples these effects.   so they went as high  10  gdp losses. while they did not envisage government mandated lockdown s , they modelled  prophylactic absenteeism  in response to  3  death rate media reports as the most severe case. an earlier paper of theirs, on uk only is open-access in the bmj. quoting their assumption from there    almost everybody in the population will know someone who has died once the mortality rate reaches one death per 300 people, triggering prophylactic absenteeism.   the same authors  keogh-brown and smith  also published in 2008 a fairly detailed post-hoc account of how economic predictions for sars fared in hindsight... which generally was not all that good, meaning that most models overestimated the economic impact of sars. it cites positively an 2003 adb paper of fan that hedged its bets on two different scenarios  early containment being one of them .  another paper verikios et al.  2015  in a similar vein but attempts a global estimate  gtap cge , and also discussed prior/related work:    the two pandemic scenarios modelled give quantitatively and qualitatively different  results.  ...  our results show that the peak gdp effects on the world economy of an influenza pandemic are in the range 0.06 to 1.01 per cent in the peak year depending on the nature of the pandemic. our results are smaller than the only previous estimates of the global economic effects of influenza pandemics by mckibbin and sidorenko  2006 . they estimate reductions in global gdp of between 0.8 and 12.6 per cent depending on the severity of the pandemic. our results are not directly comparable to mckibbin and sidorenko as they did not model a continuum of pandemic scenarios across the virulence-infectiousness continuum. rather, they assume a given reproducibility of the virus  infectiousness  and vary virulence across their four scenarios. further, they implicitly assume multiple waves for all their scenarios as they presume that  new infections continue to occur for greater than one year. this is likely to characterise only more extreme pandemics  such as the 1918-19 flu  rather than milder pandemics. differences in the range of influenza pandemics modelled by us and mckibbin and sidorenko are justifiable given the uncertain nature of future pandemics. our results thus build upon the findings of mckibbin and sidorenko by extending the estimation of potential gdp estimates over a further range of potential pandemic threat scenarios.     ...  our results show that the global macroeconomic effects of an influenza pandemic may be significant but are also likely to be short-lived. the largest economic impacts of an influenza pandemic are driven by reduced international tourism, due to risk-modifying measures by households and travel restrictions imposed by health authorities, and lost workdays, due to illness or formal social distancing measures designed to contain the virus. this is consistent with the work of keogh-brown et al.  2009, 2010 .  ...     verikios seems to work for kpmg australia nowadays and they have released a covid-19 model that is fairly detailed in explaining its assumptions, for example it has separate pre- and post-stimulus arms/scenarios, but it mostly covers the australian case, in particular only models the government response of that country.  kpmg uses a nigem  new-keynesian  macro model, and they have basically tweaked some parameters of this using estimates of shocks in four areas: reduction in productivity due to additional sick leave by workers, reduction in productivity due to additional carer is leave by workers, incremental investment premium, capacity utilisation adjustment  i.e. supply chain disruptions . the first two were informed by fairly detailed labour  amp  health statistics, the latter two seem a bit more arbitrary to me, e.g. they added a flat 1  investment premium.    i was hoping the imf would have something more concrete than this, but i guess they are weary of advancing anything more detailed yet:    the covid-19 pandemic would cause a global recession in 2020 that could be worse than the one triggered by the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, but world economic output should recover in 2021, the imf said on monday.    georgieva issued the new outlook after a conference call of g20 finance ministers and central bankers, who she said agreed on the need for solidarity across the globe.  ...     the outlook for global growth is negative and the imf expects  a recession at least as bad as during the global financial crisis, or worse,  georgieva said.    earlier this month, georgieva had warned that 2020 world growth would be below last year is 2.9 percent rate, but stopped short of predicting a recession.    georgieva on monday said that a recovery is expected in 2021, but to reach it, countries would need to prioritize containment and strengthen health systems.     the economic impact is and will be severe, but the faster the virus stops, the quicker and stronger the recovery will be,  she said.   the cbo has now posted its own assessment for the us economy. it disclaims that it is  highly uncertain, especially for later periods , but basically, for the second quarter of 2020 it predicts 10 percent unemployment and the economy to contract by  more than  7 percent.  the wto secretariat has posted this self-explanatory chart on april 8:   ",137

Can you contract COVID-19 more than once?,"there have been media reports in china, japan, and south korea about individuals who had the virus and eventually tested negative for it and were released, only to test positive for it again a short time later.  scientists in those countries have speculated that testing errors could be to blame, either for a false negative that said the patients were free of the virus or for the positive result that signalled its reoccurrence.  dr. iris gorfinkel, a family physician and medical researcher, said it is really too soon to know whether an individual can contract covid-19 more than once, and how quickly that can happen.   we actually do not know. we do not know how long-lasting the immunity is to it,  she told ctv is your morning on march 16.  these viruses have the tendency to morph and change.   in fact, it is still not even clear if people develop an immediate immunity to covid-19, as is typically the case with other virus strains, such as the flu.   so just like any other virus, there is the possibility that it could shift or drift. just minor changes could change it from a once mild infection to a more severe infection,  she explained.",0

Am I at risk if I touch someone who died of COVID-19 after they have passed away?,"covid-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads. the virus that causes covid-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact  i.e., within about 6 feet  with a person who is currently sick with covid-19. the virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. these droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. this type of spread is not a concern after death. it may be possible that a person can get covid-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. people should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of covid-19. older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious covid-19 illness. there may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. if washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community is cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. at a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. if splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment  ppe  may be required  such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and n-95 respirator . cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer is instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products  e.g., concentration, application method and contact time . products with epa-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against covid-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. after removal of ppe, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60  alcohol if soap and water are not available. soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.",96

"Wuhan flu is a very hot topic right now, and I have seen at least two papers and several bloggers attempt to model the $\mathcal{R}_0$ of the disease using the reported data on wikipedia.

The problem I have is that most of these approaches use a Guassian likelihood to get point estimates, and while that may be a good approximation, the uncertainty estimates would be more than wrong.  Consider for a moment that if there are $x$ reported cases of the flu then there can be more cases we have not seen, but not fewer.  The likelihood for any model should respect this property (that our observations can under estimate the true prevalence of the disease at a given time, but can not over estimate it).

What would be an appropriate likelihood for this process?  I imagine it would almost look like a flipped pareto distirbution. Interested in hearing your thoughts.
","too early to fit models with  r 0   with only data about the number of infected people .  the larger problem is that the development is still in the exponential phase and we can not model the decrease of the exponential growth rate. see also this question: fitting sir model with 2019-ncov data doesn  39 t conververge in that framework  sir model  the only variable that can be accurately determined is   beta -  gamma  but  r 0    beta/ gamma  is still difficult to determine  but it seems to be   beta- gamma  approx 0.4  gt  0  thus we at least know that  r 0 gt 1  .  see also the comment at the end of that answer about the use of only a time series in the number of infected people. that number does not provide a good measure of  r 0 , but it is auxiliary information that is being used. for instance direct estimates of   gamma  the parameter relating to how long people remain infectious  by observing how the virus has spread, rather than just using the quantitative numbers .    regarding your problem/question  binomial distribution  one might model the reported cases as a binomial distributed variable. the observed/reported cases will be some fraction  p  of the underlying real cases  in more advanced models this fraction could be variable depending on time and the number of cases . but the current data do not allow to study this  potentially one can fill in the gaps based on studies on a wider set of epidemical data .   given such situation  a binomial distributed fraction  one would expect that the variance is related to the mean by a factor between 0 and 1  binomial distribution has   mu   np  and  var   npq  . however when we plot an exponential curve to the data then we currently get rss being a factor 4 larger than the sum of means. thus there is posibly overdispersion instead of underdispersion  although it is not yet a good accurate measure  .   with so little data we can not be sure. in addition the model is not so great  as you say the approaches use simple gaussian likelihood . one might use some correlation in the errors. i imagine that this is a potential source of overdispersion.       data infected  lt -

"I am wondering if Americans have a constitutional right to decline being tested for the COVID-19 virus.

Consider a scenario in which the state police create a checkpoint on an interstate highway and begin administering a COVID-19 screening test on every person in every car that goes through this checkpoint. Do Americans have a constitutional right to decline being tested and be allowed to pass through this checkpoint, or does a national crisis/emergency negate an American's constitutional rights and thus every person must comply with being tested?

EDIT

To help clarify my inquiry, what I particularly would like to know is if you are directed to exit your vehicle by a state trooper at this highway checkpoint so a doctor/nurse there can administer a test on you to see if you have COVID-19, can you decline to exit your vehicle and also decline undergoing this medical test? Do Americans have a Constitutional right to decline complying with such a directive?
","it is difficult to keep track of the rapidly changing legal variables, but it would be illegal and unconstitutional for state police to set up an unauthorized stop-and-search checkpoint on the road   due process  means  following the law  . as a prelude, there would have to be some higher authority that empowers them to do this. you would have to scrutinize the emergency powers legislation of every state to be certain, but no governor has the power to mandate blanket body searches in case of a medical emergency.  martial law shifts enforcement of the law to the military, but does not generally create arbitrary decree-writing powers .  the legal foundation of such searching would have to be a new law: then the question is what the law requires that could make on-the-road body searches constitutional. since the right to be free of unreasonable searches is a fundamental constitutional right, this law would be reviewed under strict scrutiny. searches  just for fun  will not pass such scrutiny, nor will  because it is an emergency  or  keep the public safe . having the disease is not and cannot be a crime, so this law would have to be founded on a strict no-travel requirement. that brings the matter within the sphere of the  officer safety  exception in the case of an arrest. i am not suggesting that an absolute travel ban would be upheld as constitutional in the us, but that is the kind of legal foundation that would be required for state police to force people to be covid-searched.

  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advise against all but essential travel to Jamaica due to restrictions imposed by the Jamaican authorities in response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. British nationals who wish to leave Jamaica are encouraged to make travel arrangements urgently before airlines reduce direct and indirect flight options. (‘Summary’ and ‘Health’ page)

Does this mean or is there an indirect signals that UK government would be closing borders for all affected countries soon?

I reached out to TUI asking specifically that whether TUI would be arranging immediate flight in case of sudden news from UK gov to close borders in short period of time? Their response was lengthy but in essence they said they will try their best to bring everyone home if such case occurs. 

In addition I also got to know that outgoing flights from UK to Jamaica are suspended from 16th of March.

I myself and my partner are immigrant in UK and resident on Tier 2. Given the situation I am very confused on what should be my next move?

Should I arrange other flights immediately to return home or wait until next update?

Ps. I do have travel insurance, my scheduled flight is on 20th of March
","  does this mean or is there an indirect signals that uk government would be closing borders for all affected countries soon    no, it means that due to jamaica is restrictions there may be less planes available to return with.    their response was lengthy but in essence they said they will try their best to bring everyone home if such case occurs.   this is, for them, a logistic problem. will the plane needed be there on the 20th for your scheduled return flight .  having a reservation relatively soon after the 16th is a positive point for you. somebody who would be casually traveling from island to island less so.   assume nobody is interested in keeping peaple stranded. it may not work out exactly as planned, but as seen in the recent past, everybody was able to return.  keep in close contact with your travel agent and make sure you are available at short notice to leave.   if you are not satisfied with this arraignment, you can make your own. but assume this may be difficult.   also make sure that your travel insurance covers this situation if you expect them to cover the costs of your private arrangements.

"This decision means what? 


  Sufficient justification for the purpose and circumstances of the
  intended stay was not provided. The specific purpose for which the
  visa was applied for is no longer valid or will cease to be valid
  before you arrive in the member state of destination. No other
  (secondary) purpose was stated at the time of the application, of if
  it was, insufficient documentation was provided to demonstrate the
  purpose of the stay. Therefore, your application for a visa is
  refused.

","to understand what it means, let is unpack the text of the decision.    sufficient justification for the purpose and circumstances of the intended stay was not provided.   that is one of the standard reasons for refusals provided in the schengen visa code and other official documents. in general, it means that the consulate is not convinced you have a valid purpose for travel. there are many reasons why that might be and the rest is just an explanation of how they reached that conclusion.    the specific purpose for which the visa was applied for is no longer valid or will cease to be valid before you arrive in the member state of destination.   this one is more specific and should help understand the first one. what this means is that the purpose for the trip you described in your original application might have been valid at some point in the past but it is not current anymore. imagine you want to attend a conference but your application is delayed and the date of the conference has passed by the time the application is being assessed. going to a conference is a perfectly valid purpose for a trip but if that specific conference has passed, you cannot possibly attend it and it is not a valid purpose for a visit anymore.   it is difficult to say more without knowing more about your application but there are currently many restrictions on entry, travel and access to public areas across europe due to the covid-19 pandemic. so there are many legitimate trips to the schengen area that are just not possible anymore. for example, if you applied for a visa to vacation in italy, providing hotel bookings, etc. your trip does not have a purpose anymore as it will not be possible for you to stay at these hotels or visit any sights.    no other  secondary  purpose was stated at the time of the application,  or  if it was, insufficient documentation was provided to demonstrate the purpose of the stay.    a single journey can very well have several purposes. even if one of them ceases to be valid, it does not mean that the trip is necessarily useless. but, in the judgment of the consular officer, you did not describe any other sufficient purpose for this journey. it could be a reference to some detail of your application or simply some boilerplate they add to all such decisions.   note: i changed  of  into  or . it makes more sense in this sentence  it could be a simple typo or a confusion with the dutch word  of , which does mean  or .   so what does it mean for you  the decision is negative, you will not get a visa and cannot travel at this time. an appeal does not seem to make sense to me so you will need to start a new application from scratch if you want to travel to the schengen area in the future.  on the other hand, that is not the worst reason to be refused a visa. nothing suggests the consular officer suspected that you might be lying  they can use a different phrasing -  the justification  ...  was not reliable  in that case  and they have not expressed any doubt regarding your personal situation and willingness to abide by the rules. so a new application in a few months from now, when covid-19 restrictions have been lifted, seems like it would have good chances to be successful.

"When the Spanish influenza hit in 1918, it struck in two waves. The first wave was typical for a flu virus, targetting mainly elderly people, but the second wave was far deadlier and killed far more young people. How likely is it for something similar to happen with the current coronavirus? Also, wikipedia states that people who contracted the virus during the first wave were immune to it in the second wave. I thought when a virus mutates it usually avoids detection, hence why we need to usually get an up to date flu vaccine annually. Why was this not the case for the spanish influenza?
","this is a great biological question  it asks a lot about how empirical science is done in the field of modern biology  i am glad we encourage such questions from curious people who want to learn more.  mutations are mostly deleterious to begin with. this means that mutant copies of virus only very rarely survive and proliferate. a virus that is deadlier will already be less likely to reproduce, having killed more hosts.  the current estimated mutation rate of the sars-cov-2 virus is 24 bases per year. of those mutations, those to be most concerned about are those which would mutate the proteins specific to this virus. vaccine development will aim to train the immune system to target those proteins, particularly the s or spike protein.  mutations to those proteins can make potential vaccines less effective. this is why influenza   flu   vaccines, which are produced ahead of the flu season, may not always line up against the more prevalent strains which result.  a recent comment was published in nature, authored by life scientists and epidemiologists, which goes into your question in more detail, as regards to the novel coronavirus:    in this case and that of sars-cov-2, mutations consume the narrative, even though individual mutations seldom become fixed during outbreaks nor modulate complex virological traits. rather, mutation is a humdrum aspect of life for an rna virus. because these viruses employ an intrinsically error-prone rna polymerase for replication, their genomes will accumulate mutations during every copying cycle. moreover, these cycles can occur on the order of hours, ensuring that a diverse virus population will be generated within a single infected host. while this amazing capacity to mutate fuels the engine of evolutionary change, most mutations adversely impact some aspect of virus function and are removed by natural selection.  emphasis added    further, and more to the original point of your question:    these warnings will probably not halt the question as to whether mutations will arise in sars-cov-2, enabling it to spread more efficiently between humans or generate a higher case fatality rate. in response, we can look to the 2002-2003 sars-cov epidemic. large deletions in the open reading frame 8  orf8  region and mutations in the spike  s  protein were discovered during the early stages of the outbreak and eventually dominated the epidemic, suggesting that these were adaptations to humans12,13. based on this observation, some hypothesized that virus genetic changes in part drove the sars epidemic, but this claim is unsubstantiated14. so, could sars-cov-2 adapt in the same way  yes. will adaptation precipitate more deaths  unlikely.  emph. added   ",66

She belittles both, plays favorites, talks about her impending death, threatens them with all manner of scary stories and regularly slaps then on the head or back with an open palm.

I am convinced she has a personality disorder including OCD and NPD (I suggested therapy and was told to f-off). She has been drunk while they are in her care on many occasions as well.

She is currently a stay-at-home mum, however, we have had a maid since the eldest was born who bathed and fed them, and now I work from home and do most of the cleaning etc..

Do I simply rock up at the CPA and tell them the situation? Why would they believe me? How to prove this? I would give her everything as long as I can care for the boys.
","the mother does not seem like she will change her ways. some people might encourage you to try to talk to her about her treatment of the kids, to give her an ultimatum, but personally i think this could just make the situation worse. you need to get the kids away from her. the best way to do this would be the legal route, unless you greatly expect that she will happily let you have full custody, not wanting to see the kids for them, or out of spite against you.   any evidence you can get will be very useful. the maid may be able to support what you say, depending on how open your wife is with her mistreatment of the kids. i would also suggest trying to get some video or audio recordings, but you should look into whether these can be used in court if the other person is not aware that they are being recorded.   in terms of the kitchen, i suggest kid-proofing it. try to store any dangerous items out of their reach, and any low cupboards that need to store dangerous items should have childproofing locks.

","short answer: probably not.   long answer: for your body to build immunity against something, it needs to identify it as something harmful to you. otherwise, how would it know if this is just some random particle in your environment that it should ignore  there are molecular clues that your body uses to recognize better whether something is likely a pathogen  that means it should try to build immunity against  and those are some of the additives  known as adjuvants  present in man-made vaccines.   also, the route of administration is also important. things that you eat or breath in are triaged by the waldeyer ring because maybe you just ate something that is alive, but not exactly a pathogen. dysfunctions in this process  thinking a normal protein is part of a dangerous pathogen  is believed to be one of the possible causes of allergies. injecting it into your blood-stream often makes it more effective  but there are exceptions: polio vaccine however can be orally administered .   a nice read about this topic is this: the dichotomy of pathogens and allergens in vaccination approaches.  this is perhaps a must read on this topic: what to expect of a good vaccine and how to achieve it.  i am not really sure what else to tell you. the process you described is a part of the manufacturing of some vaccines, so you are on the right track. but vaccines are hard to make, you can not do it for every disease and involves a lot of experimenting.

"I am interested in creating a web tool to predict the absolute risk of in-hospital death from a published risk model of COVID-19 patients.  

Is it possible to estimate the intercept from the significant, multivariable model coefficients published(Table 3 at https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3)?
","no, for a few reasons. the most relevant is that, even if you could numerically determine the value of the intercept term in the model, you would not be able to tell what conditions are represented by the intercept term of the model fit by the researchers  unless they provided some very specific details about their methods, e.g.,  did they center their predictors , etc. .  the way these models are defined, you need to know what the  reference  point of each coefficient is. by convention the reference point for continuous variables is often zero, but the choice of reference is completely arbitrary for categorical variables  though it does appear to be stated in the article .  on a more conceptual note, models like this one are often limited in their ability to predict accurate  class probabilities  because their goal is to explain relationships between predictors, or to describe relative risk-reducing or risk-increasing relationships among the predictors in the model. often these models use only a limited number of variables to arrive at a parsimonious model, which tries to keep multicollinearity low, so that the individual effects of predictors are easier to interpret.   another way of looking at it is this: the model may have been designed to address research questions such as:  what is the relative importance of age with respect to the risk of an in-hospital death after controlling for other demographic factors  . even if the model does this very well, it may be very bad at answering fundamentally different questions, such as  what is the probability that a female will experience an in-hospital death   ",57
"The protease inhibitor lopinavir, originally developed as a cure against AIDS and HIV, has been shown efficient against SARS Coronavirus SARS-CoV.

Why is Lopinavir not efficient against SARS-CoV-2? Is there a difference in the gene encoding for the protease?
","is there a difference in the gene encoding for the protease   this paper by wu et al. annotates the sars-cov-2 genome and compares its divergence from other coronaviruses, which may help answer your second question.  this annotation includes 16 genes for non-structural protein   nsp  . supplemental materials for this paper indicate that all but two of these proteins  nsp7 and nsp13  have amino acid substitutions between sars-cov-2   2019-ncov  in the paper  and sars-cov.   the gene nsp5 encodes 3clpro  chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease , so there are differences there.   literature suggests nsp5 and other non-structural proteins are potential targets for a number of antiviral therapies.  another paper suggests further that lopinavir targets nsp3 products, among other proteins, in use against sars-cov:    lopinavir is possible target is nsp3b, nsp3c, helicase, nrbd or e-channel with the mfscores of -158.050, -189.140, -114.018, -171.127, and -221.785, respectively.   the nsp3 gene contains a papain-like protease 2  pl2pro  domain. supplemental materials from the first linked paper suggest nsp3 has a different amino acid sequence between sars-cov and sars-cov-2.   it might be worth digging into the wu et al. paper and the raw annotation data to look at what those a.a. substitutions are, to see if that might help in determining why lopinavir is not as efficient at inactivating pl2pro and reducing levels of the novel coronavirus.  it may also be worth considering the target itself. going back to the nature biotechnology article:    but erik de clercq, of the rega institute for medical research in leuven, belgium, says that in searching for or designing effective drugs against covid-19:  we should stay away from antivirals known to be acting at targets not playing a role in the replication of coronaviruses.  such drugs include penciclovir, which is targeted at the herpesvirus dna polymerase, and lopinavir/ritonavir, which are targeted at the hiv protease. instead, he would favor targeting a virus-specific protein such as the rna-dependent rna polymerase, noting that coronaviruses do not contain or use a reverse transcriptase.

If so, why do I keep getting a common cold again and again? Do I keep exposing myself to a new different strain of the same virus?

Based on the fact that there are over 200 different types of viruses that cause a common cold. To what extent do you think creating a universal vaccine for the common cold could be successful, and what are the challenges facing scientists in creating a successful universal vaccine?
","  if i get infected once with the virus which causes a common cold, does that mean i will not get infected with the same strain of the virus ever in my lifetime     it depends on quirks of your immune system and the viral load you are exposed to, but in theory  based on vaccination and other studies , presence of the virus will trigger a suppressive response, not to nasal mucosal invasion but to viral replication and cell destruction/inflammation to the degree that you clinically manifest  a cold .   regarding your quirks,    the persistence of high-titer serotype-specific antibody is associated with protection from infection as well as reduced symptom severity following experimental challenge with the same serotype  52 . however, there is little cross-neutralization among serotypes, which presents a challenge to vaccine development, given that there are more than 100 different known hrv serotypes  53 . further support for the role of humoral immunity in the prevention and control of hrv infection was observed in a study of patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia. these patients experienced more frequent and severe hrv infections than their healthy spouses despite the administration of replacement immunoglobulin therapy  54 .   that is only the beginning. immunology is very complex.    to what extent do you think creating a universal vaccine for the common cold could be successful...   close to, if not, zero.  there are about 120 distinctly different serotypes of rhinovirus which cause the  common cold , which could require 120 separate vaccines. also a significant percentage of  colds  are caused by other types of viruses  coronavirus - like tat in china right now, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza and parainfluenza viruses  as well as some bacteria.    human coronaviruses, members of the coronaviridae family, were first identified in 1962 and have been particularly difficult to isolate by use of standard cell culture techniques.   one needs to reliably grow a virus before making a vaccine.    efforts at vaccine development are hindered by the existence of more than 100 hrv serotypes with high-level sequence variability in the antigenic sites.   and    compared to patients with coronavirus-associated colds, there is no difference in respiratory symptom severity or duration.   however, there is a light at the end of the tunnel: the older you get, the fewer new viruses you are exposed to  if you stay in one geograpical location , and the fewer colds you get. i have not had a  common cold  in a few years now. if i move across the continent, i will have more colds.

(An accusation for which, I have to say, the Chinese political officials presented no real evidence, and which seems to contradict even what the Chinese scientists have been saying about the same issue.)

Question: How have US pro-life groups responded to Trump's stance during the COVID-19 crisis, given that this stance could permit more deaths?

A National Review article seems to indicate pro-life groups are reconciling the deaths by arguing that a poor economy will also lead to deaths, but even Republican politicians are arguing that large numbers of dead people will hurt the economy:


  There will be no normally functioning economy if our hospitals are overwhelmed and thousands of Americans of all ages, including our doctors and nurses, lay dying because we have failed to do what’s necessary to stop the virus.
  Rep. Liz Cheney, via Twitter


So it's unclear to me how US pro-life groups can reconcile this.
","there is nothing to reconcile. pro-life does not mean  against  needless  death , it means anti-abortion.  the same is true for the opposite label: pro-choice means in favor of legal access to abortion, not necessarily in favor of all individual choices  eg regarding assisted suicide or drug policies .    people supporting  pro-life  can still support the death penalty, wars, restricted access to healthcare  for the poor , terrorist attacks against abortion providers, denial of healthcare to pregnant women even in case of a non-viable fetus, etc.  response to the lax attitude regarding human life has been minimal, as that is not their issue  abortions are. the focus during this crisis by anti-abortion groups seems to be to further attack legal access to abortion. the sba list coronavirus page or the live action news page eg focus on denying access to abortion  amp  defunding abortion providers during the crisis.  the few responses i was able to find are not from groups, but individuals, and seem to argue in the same direction as you mention: relativizing the deaths by downplaying the risk  amp  impact and saying that a weak economy will also have a price. eg:     economic hardship without a clear path to recovery imperils lives too  as evidence by a 300  spike in calls to the national suicide prevention hotline    ...  targeted isolation of and care for the elderly is entirely possible while allowing the younger and healthier to go about their lives.   others take a more utilitarian approach, weighing the  lives saved  due to denied access to abortion during the crisis vs deaths from coronavirus.  at least some individual people who hold anti-abortion views have opposed the economy   life view. the following quote is attributed to rep. cheney, though i was only able to find it by erick erickson:    letting the virus spread to your parents and grandparents to protect your 401k is not pro-life.   russell moore argues along the same lines in a nyt opinion piece, though without explicitly mentioning abortion or  pro-life .

"What do we know about the environmental limits for nCoV to survive outside the body? For example, in:

"I noticed that a lot of countries introducing quarantines and other measures to fight COVID-19 also included a ban on people gathering. I am wondering, how can it be enforced?

When a government wants to stop people protests and similar actions the ban can be easily enforced, because protesters must put themselves in evidence otherwise their protest would have no purpose. But in the case of an epidemic the ban should prevent also people gathering in a discreet manner in a backstreet or a public garden. No country, not even the authoritarian ones have enough policemen to monitor every single corner. 

Furthermore if people violate the ban and refuse to pay the fine, what are they going to do? Put them in a crowded prison? Wouldn't that defeat the purpose?

Last detail if there are limits in the way a ban can be enforced. How effective can a ban be at preventing public gatherings? 

Edit: 

I would like to point out something that none of the answers considers. When a government gives an order, or issues a prohibition, then they have to enforce it, it is also a strong commitment for the state itself. This means devoting a large portion of the police force to it while they could have been employed for other tasks. Furthermore the stronger the prohibition the higher the chance that some people may eventually challenge it and lead to confrontations with the police forces.

Had there been just a ban on public events plus a recommendation to people not to gather in big number, without such a strong commitment, what would have been the difference in effectiveness and pressure put on the police force and other state resources?
","  i am wondering, how can it be enforced    by the authorities, wielding the law and their monopoly on the use of force. i think society, the mainstream media and social media will also create social pressure and consequences.  obviously the effectiveness of the ban depends on the proportion of people abiding by it. that a minority will inevitably flout the ban does not mean the ban is wholly useless.    furthermore if people violate the ban and refuse to pay the fine, what  are they going to do  put them in a crowded prison    yes, ban violators might be imprisoned.  http://english.elpais.com/spanish news/2020-03-15/members-of-the-spanish-public-face-fines-or-even-prison-if-they-disobey-lockdown-rules.html    would not that defeat the purpose    if the person is not infected, the prisoners are no worse off. if the person is infected, perhaps he or she can be put in solitary confinement or a repurposed toilet paper warehouse. whether the person is infected or not infected, society is better off.   there is no country on the planet that can cope with large proportions of their populations being hospitalised  particularly if they need intensive care or mechanical ventilation , which is one of the things that such a ban is intended to reduce the risk of. ",35
"With the news that Boris Johnson has tested positive for COVID-19, and was later hospitalised, a question occurred to me: 

What happens if the UK Prime Minister suddenly dies?  

I know that the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the party with the most seats, and presumably the party would somehow choose a new leader as soon as they can.  However, organizing a vote of the Conservative part membership would still require at least a few days under normal circumstances;  and under the current circumstances, it might take significantly longer.  

Is there simply no Prime Minister until the governing party can choose another one?  If so, how are the functions of the head of government performed during this time?

I'd be interested in knowing how this would work (if it's any different) in other Westminster systems as well.  I saw the question on What happens if the UK Prime Minister resigns?, but the answer there assumes a orderly transition period during which the incumbent continues to serve while a new party leader is chosen.  
","your understanding is correct - there is no uk prime minister until one is appointed by the queen. in the meantime, the civil contingencies act  2004  gives the monarch  in practice, government ministers  powers to make emergency regulations, and cobra meetings can be chaired by any cabinet minister - after 9/11, these were chaired by the cabinet secretary until the pm could attend himself.  the queen will appoint as pm the person most likely to command the confidence of the house of commons. in practice, this is the person chosen as the leader of the party with the most mps - in this case, the party that the deceased pm previously led. how this is chosen, and how quickly, will depend on the party in question, although in these circumstances it seems likely that an interim leader would be speedily chosen. the labour party is rules for this are described in steve melnikoff is answer here. in the case of the conservative party, their constitution states under schedule 2 - rules for the election of the leader that:      upon the initiation of an election for the leader, it shall be the  duty of the 1922 committee to present to the party, as soon as  reasonably practicable, a choice of candidates for election as leader.  the rules for deciding the procedure by which the 1922 committee  selects candidates for submission for election shall be determined by  the executive committee of the 1922 committee after consultation of  the board.   if there is only one candidate at the time laid down for  the close of nominations, that candidate shall be declared leader of  the party.     it would be possible, then, for mps to be strongly encouraged to only nominate one candidate in order to conclude this process as quickly as possible, without a full membership vote. you may remember in 2016, for example, andrea leadson withdrew from the leadership contest leaving theresa may as the sole candidate, which meant that there was no ballot of the party membership.  in the specific case you raise, however, foreign secretary dominic raab was given the role of wouldesignated survivor  on march 22nd, and will carry out johnson is duties that he can not perform himself while he is affected by the virus. it should be noted that this role is not an official post, and if johnson were to die from the virus then it is not a given that raab would be appointed leader of the party and therefore the new pm. in fact, the article notes that this designation was challenged by some in the cabinet, who thought that the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster, michael gove, should have been given the role, and indeed  gove replaced johnson at the daily press briefing on march 27th. another contender might be jeremy hunt, against whom johnson won the conservative party leadership election in 2019.  as for other westminster systems, there is no blanket answer to that question. it is perfectly possible for a bill to be introduced that immediately designates the new prime minister on their death, as in the us system. indeed, in 2013, peter bone mp introduced the prime minister  replacement  bill, which contains the following provision:    in the event of the death or incapacitation of a person holding the  title of prime minister and first lord of the treasury, the title,  salary and functions of that role shall be conferred upon another  secretary or minister of state in accordance with the following order  of precedence--        a  person bearing the designation of deputy prime  minister     b  secretary of state with responsibility for home affairs    c  secretary of state with responsibility for defence   ...     this bill did not make it onto the statute books, but it proves the point that it is possible for an order of succession to exist in a westminster system.

"Information about (simple) mask wearing (concerning covid19) is a complete mystery to me. On several official places it is not recommended for a person without symptoms to wear a mask. For example: 

https://youtu.be/Ded_AxFfJoQ
(time 0:20)

or here:

https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/should-i-wear-a-mask-to-protect-against-the-coronavirus

However no explanation is given - which makes me wonder (and even angry). I think everybody should wear a mask because:


Many persons feel ashamed wearing it, even those with symptoms. If everybody wears it, they do not feel ashamed and wear it.
As far as I know, one is (wrt covid19) contagious before developing symptoms. So if everybody wears the mask also these people do.


The two above points act as a collective protection.


Simple mask certainly will lower ""getting / spreading illness"" probability. Of course the ""holes"" (in a simple mask) are too big to prevent completely virus to enter (or get out when coughing), but it lowers probability! Even if it lowers the transmission probability by e.g. 5%, it might be a lot. As a hypothetical example: it might reduce R0 from 1.02 to 0.97 and so stop the virus spread so fast.

"I am starting a PhD abroad, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic I cannot leave my country at the moment. My advisor has agreed that I can work remotely (starting later is not an option). While we can Skype and most of my work can be done online, I am concerned that having no access to the department, not being able to attend seminars/workshops, and not being able to meet/talk to other students in person will put me at a big disadvantage.

I am keen not to spend these initial few months slacking off and want to catch any problems before it is too late. However, I have always found it difficult to judge my own progress when studying alone, and with a PhD it seems that it will be especially hard as I need to learn a lot of skills in a new area. Also, because my advisor seems like a very 'nice' person who does not demand that his students work very hard, I am concerned that he will not tell me if I am underperforming.

Would it be appropriate to raise this with my advisor, asking him to tell me if I am not doing as well as his students usually do? Or are there any strategies for people working from home to judge if they are doing enough?
","yes, you should raise this issue, both with the advisor and with the university administration. students need some feedback on their work and it is the university is responsibility to provide a way for that to happen. they need to provide the channels and you need to find a way to use them.   but things are in a bit of chaos now, of course, and effective response can be slow to occur.   virtual seminars are possible using simple or sophisticated software. perhaps you can set up  or the university can  a group of students and a professor or two willing to have an online session regularly. it is not the same as face to face, but it can keep you engaged.   but at a minimum, write a lot and note where you have problems. ask a lot of questions, but make sure they are pretty focused. share what you write with your advisor, by email or by posting it somewhere.   ask your advisor directly how you are doing and ask explicitly for next steps. you will most likely get suggestions about reading. take a lot of notes on the readings and note things that puzzle you. ask about them.   if you are starting the research phase of the degree it is normally a fairly solitary effort in any case, but the advisor should be willing to review and respond to your efforts and your questions.

"I was thinking about this problem when I searched up how warm it takes to kill the new coronavirus. A source said 132 fahrenheit for 30 minutes. I wanted to calculate how much energy that would take so then I could easily find out how long I would have to microwave an object to get the same results.

","the amount of energy required to maintain water at some temperature over some time is simply equal to the amount of energy that the water loses to the environment over that time.  it depends on the conditions that the water is in, specifically how much heat the water is losing the environment. for example, it will take more energy to maintain water at 132 f when you place it in a cold windy environment because it is losing lots of heat in that environment.  so let is say you have a simple scenario of a pot of water sitting in room temperature. a simple energy balance on your water gives:     q  in    ha s t-t 0      where  q  in   is the input power,  h  is an effective heat transfer coefficient telling how much heat the water loses to the ambient  typical value of 5-10  w/m 2k  for a 56 c object sitting in a room with no wind ,  a s  is the surface area of your water container,  t  is the temperature of the water  56 c , and  t 0  is room temperature  25 c .  so, all you need is the surface area of your water container. then solve for the required power  q in , and multiply by time  30 min  to get the required energy.     q  in    tq  in       where  t  is the time you desire  30 min . that is how you do it.

"We often get sore throats once or twice a year, and it clears in a few days sometimes without any antibiotics. I was wondering why doesn't our body become immune after clearing a sore throat?
"," short answer    it should be noted that there are many non-pathogenic causes of sore throat, and i would suspect that you are not always distinguishing these causes from actual illness.   in most cases, it would not be possible to build a response  immunological or otherwise  to avoid reacting to these stressors.   bacteria and viruses mutate frequently in ways that make your immune system unable to properly recognize them to ward off initial infection.   your immune system recognizes specific pathogens based on structural characteristics. if those characteristics change when pathogens mutate  which happens fairly frequently , your immune system will not recognize it as readily  or initially at all .      long answer   sore throat is most commonly attributed to pharyngitis, or the inflammation of the back of the throat called the pharynx.  causes  sore throats can be caused by many things.  e.g., see here, summarized below :  first off, a sore throat can be the result of many things unrelated to illness:    allergies dryness irritants excessive talking,singing,shouting,etc. muscle strain gastroesophageal reflux disease  gerd    as a result, at least 30    higher in adults  of reported sore throat cases  and supposedly many more unreported cases  are not due to any type of illness.   further, a number of pathogens can cause a sore throat:   viruses   rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, adenoviruses, epstein-barr, etc.  see here for one estimate of relative etiologies .   bacteria   a number of bacterial infections can cause a sore throat. the most common is streptococcus pyogenes  aka  strep a  .     it turns out that pathogen-caused pharyngitis is fairly common. supposedly 10  of adults with sore throats have strep, and around 70  of children pharyngitis cases seen by doctors are either virally or bacterially caused.    however, it should be noted that only 20-30  of children and just 5-10  of adults have bacteria to blame for their sore throat, with viral infections being much more common.  source: idsa .   sore throat frequency  it turns out that sore throats are fairly common  jones  2004  determined that about 7.5  of people have a sore throat in any three-month period. further, on average, adults get a sore throat two to three times a year and children about five times a year  tamparo 2011 and rutter  amp  newby 2015 , so your personal experience is fairly average.  because viral causes and non-pathogenic causes make up an overwhelming percentage of overall sore throat cases, it should not be surprising that most sore throats clear up without the use of any antibiotics.   as for those that are caused by pathogens:  why no immunity   bacteria and viruses both mutate fairly quickly  see antigenic variation, antigenic drift and antigenic shift , so it should not be surprising that you are capable of having an immune response to pathogens throughout life.    if we consider just strep alone, it mutates/reemerges with improved fitness frequently  e.g., see bao et al 2016 and their citations  and see sanjuan et al.  2010  for a reviewof viral mutation rates.    so not only are there a number of pathogens that can cause sore throat, but each of these pathogens can mutate. that leaves you with a fairly sizable number of potential invaders that can illicit a sore throat.   let is see how your immune system responds:  your immune system contains cells that can be split into two broad groups: cells that belong to the adaptive immune system, and cells which belong to the innate immune system.  see here for a simple explanation .   innate immune system: consists of cells responsible for initial detection of pathogens, recruitment of other immune cells, activation of the complement system, engulfment and  more immediate  destruction of pathogens.  adaptive immune system: consists of cells which coordinate to develop a memory of the infections they have seen previously in order to mount a faster, more pronounced immune response to repeat pathogens.   depending on the kind of foreign invasion, two different immune responses can occur in either of these 2 broader  systems : either a humoral response involving antibodies or a cell-mediated repsponse.    a general feature of the immune system is that these mechanisms rely on detecting structural features of the pathogen or toxin that mark it as distinct from host cells  see chaplin 2010 for a review . the mechanisms permitting recognition of pathogenic/toxic foreign structures can be broken down into two general categories:    hard-wired responses encoded by genes that recognize molecular patterns shared both by many microbes and toxins that are not present in the mammalian host. this is the innate system described above. responses that are encoded by gene elements that somatically rearrange to assemble antigen-binding molecules with extreme specificity for individual unique foreign structures. this is the adaptive system described above.   antibodies recognizes a unique/specific molecule of the harmful agent, called an antigen, and binds to it to tag it for immune attack.        because the adaptive system is composed of small numbers of cells with specificity for any individual pathogen the responding cells must proliferate after encountering the antigen in order to attain sufficient numbers to mount an effective response against the microbe or the toxin.  source: chaplin 2010 .    this means that you can still experience some mild symptoms due to the invading pathogen.     the important take-away from all this, though, is that your immune response relies on structural  markers  on pathogens in order to recognize them. this is true for both innate and adaptive immune responses. if the physical/structural properties of a pathogen change  due to antigenic processes and mutations as mentioned above  your immune system will be slower  and possibly ineffective  in responding to an attack.    the result, then, could be another one of those sore throats...     citations   bao, yun-juan et al.  phenotypic differentiation of streptococcus pyogenes populations is

"If, as a US citizen or resident, I had flu-like symptoms and if I was not covered by Medicaid/Medicare and didn't have health insurance, who would be liable for paying for COVID-19 test diagnostics in a US hospital?

I saw an offhand remark about ""the cost and people not getting tested as a result"", in an online forum.  It wasn't even a claim that it was happening, more like a quip that it might happen.

The US healthcare vs Euro/Canadian-style coverage debate has been done to death, but it usually revolves around the problems lack of coverage brings to the people who are ill.  This is not what I am asking about.

An epidemic situation however brings a different dynamic:  there's a vested interested for everyone else that sick people are identified as such and isolated, it's not just about the being well-being of the patients.  To assist in containment, you want to remove as many barriers to early diagnosis as possible.

Is there/could there be some form of emergency funding for at least the tests themselves, at the federal level?  One model is for example, the financial arrangements around vaccination programs.

Edit:

the question concerns the procedure for the entire test, i.e. lab services as well as clinic time:  seeing a doctor/nurse, taking the tests and getting the results.  Nothing more, but also all of what's necessary for a YES/NO answer wrt having COVID-19 or not.  

Bryan's answer is great wrt to the kit and lab services themselves, but someone still needs to interview you and take whatever samples are necessary to send off for testing,

Do these arrangements vary by state?  Or does the Federal govt, through the CDC, have jurisdiction?

State vs Federal:  it seems to me that a Federal-level guidance ought to be faster than waiting for all 50 states to come up with their own programs individually.
","the cdc covers the cost of testing itself, however, this may not be the only type of cost incurred.    a recent new york times article presents a case study of exactly the sort of scenario described in the question.  americans who were living in china and evacuated from wuhan did not have health insurance in the us and were given a  3,918 bill for care during quarantine, including  2,598 for ambulance transportation. neither ultimately tested positive.    he did receive a document upon leaving quarantine directing him to contact a government email address with any medical bills. he sent an email on feb. 24 detailing the charges and asking what would be done.     my question is why are we being charged for these stays, if they were mandatory and we had no choice in the matter   mr. wucinski wrote in his message.    he has not received a response, he said.   since then, after being contacted by the times, the hospital stated the bill was in error:    when contacted by the new york times, a rady children is hospital spokesman said the physicians  bill had been sent in error and that the family would not be held responsible for the charges.   ..but it is not clear whether this is a matter of policy or a public relations move by the hospital, nor is it clear how these matters will be handled going forward. it also does not yet resolve the  2600 ambulance bill  of course this is all still pending .  the government can order mandatory quarantines, but as far as who pays:     there is no uniform practice,  said lawrence gostin, a professor of global health law at georgetown university.  they do have the powers, but they have almost never used them in modern times.    without some new government intervention, it seems that for now costs will either be charged to patients or simply absorbed by the treating facilities  by not billing .    the american hospital association and american nurses association on feb 27, 2020 have asked for the government to fund care related to the epidemic. it seems likely that there will be further political fights over what exactly is done next.    update: as of march 4th, 2020, an agreement was reached in the house on a bill for covid-2019 funding, which is expected to pass there and later in the senate. this bill does not address how to deal with care and testing for the uninsured, though it includes state and local funding. it is unclear at this time how those funds could/will be used:    congress did not explicitly address how to handle funding for mandatory quarantines or the uninsured. the package would send  950 million in state and local grants, with half of the money due within 30 days. states will receive a minimum of  4 million.   http://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/04/coronavirus-funding-package-121209 ",131
"I'm currently in my undergraduate junior year studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada. I'm hoping to apply for Top 10 US grad schools in mechanical engineering in about 18 months. In response to the worldwide COVID-19 health crisis, our institution has (as have most academic institutions) switched to online teaching and made many changes to the structure of our courses to accommodate the situation.

As part of these changes, the university has offered students the option to selectively change the grade reporting on their transcripts to CR/NCR (Credit/No Credit) at the end of this semester. Normally, my grades would be pretty good (hovering around ~3.9 GPA) and I wouldn't bother to report my grades as a CR instead of as a percentage, but this crisis has completely disoriented me and made it difficult to focus on my studies.

Furthermore, the university has allowed instructors to retroactively adjust the course breakdown/weighting away from the original syllabus--this means that tests/projects that were originally worth 15% of the grade might have been increased to upwards of 40% weighting. This has had a negative impact on my course grades as well, as I was hoping to make up for poor showings on some of these lower-weight deliverables with strong final exam performances. Instead, these final exams are going to be worth much less now.

In the aftermath of these changes, I'm contemplating using the CR/NCR option on some of my course grades, particular with any grade that ends up lower than my current GPA. However, I'm worried about how this will be interpreted in my grad school admissions in a couple years. In normal circumstances, I think changing a percentage grade into a CR/Pass grade would be a red flag that a student's performance in the class was less-than-stellar.

Given the COVID-19 crisis and its effects on academia as a whole, are admissions committees two years down the road likely to be understanding if I decide to take advantage of the CR option now? Should I make use of it and explain that this was ""the coronavirus semester"" in my application package, or am I dooming myself by converting my grades from percentage into CRs?
","the situation is chaotic and it is difficult to make a prediction or give firm advice. either path could be better than the other, depending on the judgments of others.   however, one prediction that i can make with confidence is that universities sending out grades will also be sending out explanations that extraordinary measures were taken in extraordinary times. furthermore those receiving grades and such will understand that the situation was chaotic and that the ordinary procedures need to be modified.   if it were me, i would probably opt for the grades rather than pass/fail. if necessary, i would just explain that the general chaos affected my performance somewhat and the grades may not accurately reflect my potential. i would suspect that letter writers would back that up. but that is partly because i would have a history of excellent performance generally and not one that would be questioned in the absence of the current situation.  this is the hypothetical me speaking, not the real me.   but the pass fail option can also be explained fairly easily that the risks were higher due to general disruption and you considered it the safer option as the rules were changing, making earlier assumptions invalid.   i expect that there will be more emphasis put on interviews and on letters of recommendation for a while until things settle down again. but that is just a guess.

"I have a language course booked in two weeks in Barcelona and would like to get there either by train or bus (due to 'flight shame') from Germany in times of the COVID-19 outbreak. 

Going by train would mean traveling via Cologne (Germany), Brussels, Paris (that makes me really afraid), on the return journey via Paris and Frankfurt Main (Germany). However, there is also a Flixbus directly going to Barcelona from Frankfurt. 

Though I already booked the train tickets via Paris, I could stil get a refund and thereby get most of the money back. :-) So what would you say, is it safer to travel by bus rather than by train? 

However, I was also wondering whether trains aren't equally safe as buses, since I could just stand all the time in a TGV in the floor or just sit on my luggage where there aren't so many people?
","it is somewhat hard to answer this one. you obviously concerned, but not enough to forfeit the course and cancel the trip. you are a bit afraid, but not enough so to overcome you  flight shame  and hop on a direct plane.   however, you are afraid enough to consider either spending a 25-hour trip on a flixbus or a 13-hour train trip standing on the corridor. for some reason you are more afraid of paris than cologne or barcelona, and more afraid of trains than buses.  at this point, my honest suggestion is that you do whatever makes you feel most comfortable.   given that you have already decided to travel, and to travel by either train or bus, the choice between those two matters little.  on a train, you will be in a carriage with 120 people. a dozen or so in close proximity to you. in a bus you will be with 60 people. a dozen or so in close proximity to you. there is no evidence that one is significantly riskier than the other.  if you want to minimise your time with people, take a plane or rent a car.

"Decision on how long to keep the economy ""shut down"" depends on the evaluation of how deadly/infectious coronavirus is. 

So I would assume that countries would try to test random members of ""healthy""(no sign of illness) population to determine the spread in the population.

I assume this was not done because tests are in high demand for people that exhibit symptoms, but could not find any confirmation for my thesis.

There is this question from 3 weeks ago, but from what I understand no answer claims there is a generalized sampling.
","this may seem counterintuitive, but constructing and administering a properly random testing paradigm is difficult and time-consuming. it is not as though we can gather everyone in a big room, put their names in a hat, and then call them out one-by-one to get tested. there are a number of different issues that need to be resolved, e.g.:   people are not randomly distributed. in the real world they cluster by race, religion, economic status, political affiliation, occupation, and other demographic factors. a purely random sample  unless it is immense  will likely underrepresent or overrepresent specific populations. people are not easy to find. say that joe smith is someone randomly chosen to be tested. what if we can not reach him by phone or email  what if we send a testing kit to him and he neglects to return it, or uses the kit incorrectly  what if we send a iswabber  to his house, only to find he is not home, or refuses to open the door  depending on methodology, sampling in this context can have massive non-participation, and the more non-participants we see, the weaker our statistical results are. people are not infected entirely randomly. infections are a markov chain, where one must be in specific kinds of contact with an infected person to have a chance of being infected, and then  if infected  must be in the same specific kinds of contact with uninfected people to pass it on. modeling a markov chain as though it were purely random misses important aspects of the way a disease is spread, and will skew results badly. perhaps most importantly, the spread of a pandemic is a fluid situation, not a stable characteristic of individuals. collecting physical samples from people requires a tremendous amount of time and labor  driving to a home and collecting a sample, driving to another home and collecting a sample, repeat, repeat, drive back to homes where people were absent and try again . even if we could muster a veritable army of iswabbers  for our random sampling of nearly 400 million people, we can expect the actually swabbing to take at least a week  generously , and in a week the number of infections has doubled and doubled again. the first people swabbed are not being drawn from the same statistical population as the last people swabbed, and our statistics will suffer. and then we have to ask about our swabbers, who are all part of the population we are sampling, and all of whom have been exposed to large numbers of potentially infected people...   the upshot is that if we were to take the time to properly construct and implement a large-scale random sample, the disease would be spreading while we were designing the methodology, the disease would be spreading while we were implementing the testing, and by the time we finished running the data we collected the disease would have spread further, making our results all but useless. i am not saying they would be entirely useless -- with appropriate statistical manipulations we can account for many of these issues -- but whatever use it has will be for future epidemiologists looking back on this pandemic.

Can I exercise outside? What about going to the park?,"yes, but do not forget about social distancing.  regular exercise can help keep you physically and mentally healthy during the outbreak. you should feel free to talk a walk, go to the park and get outside, but maintain at least 6 feet between yourself and others during that time. do not pack into a crowded park, beach or hiking trail. instead, head to an area with fewer people or exercise at off-hours, when not as many people are out and about.  since covid-19 can live on hard surfaces, and most playgrounds are not cleaned and disinfected regularly, you may want to reconsider bringing your child there, especially if you live in an area with ongoing coronavirus transmissions. if you do decide to go to the playground, make sure your child stays at least 6 feet away from other children.",140

"During these unprecedented times, it is quite hard to predict whether any recently advertised academic jobs will be still available next fall, as some countries might enforce social distancing or lockdown for a whole year. Still, many conferences are cancelled or delayed this year, thus getting papers published harder, alongside with academic path progression. I guess that we should be trying to get journal papers accepted instead...

Given that I am at the end of a fixed term assistant professor position (looking possibly forward for an open term/tenure track one), I'm asking if it will be possible that universities will still be hiring new APs when they might be asked to close until further notice (e.g, UK). Is it still possible that some degrees will convert all of their modules  into on-line classes (e.g., for Computer Science), thus allowing universities to get the same number of students they expected in the following academic year? This is still a relevant question - I think -, as the hiring of new junior accademic staff goes hand in hand with an expected increased amount of students on campus. Do you have any insight on this, or do you think that it is too early to make any possible educated guess?

","the road to the future is never smooth and upward trending. it is bumpy. in the current chaotic situation, expect chaos in the short term. others, such as myself, have experienced career setbacks due to circumstances we can not control. i finished my doctorate at a time when the market for mathematicians was one of zero demand and massive supply. but over time, the bumps eased out for us. perhaps, and we hope, they will for you also. but prediction of the future is an uncertain business riddled with errors among fantastic claims.   unfortunately too many governments around the world are behaving incompetently, making everything worse. but in the long run, climate change will probably have a bigger effect than the current pandemic. and it is also being ignored by some governments.   however, unless we are willing to give up scientific study altogether and unless we are willing to give up educating the citizenry for the future, there is a lot of incentive to continue as we have as much as we can within the constraints that we see. universities have many incentives to maintain their services and their structures. most feel an obligation to faculty, students, society, and science itself. those are strong positive forces.   the incentives, however, need to be met with action. we do not have answers yet to some important questions. one of the questions is how meaningful and complete we can make an education without face to face interactions. another is how we can continue some sorts of research, say lab sciences, without physical labs staffed by researchers. these are hard questions. it will take some innovation. conferences could, in principle, move to virtual space, just as  classroom  education is doing now.   fortunately we are in a better place today than even 20 years ago with fairly ubiquitous internet communication. some of the problems are probably solvable relatively quickly.   but we do not know how many students will seek higher education in the next couple of years. we do not know how taxing authorities will deal with funding education in the face of economic disruption. some, but not all, signs are positive. but uncertainty is high. budgets, needs for faculty, working conditions, etc. all in flux.   i suspect that the careers of people in your situation will be disrupted for a while, as mine was. but i also suspect that the situation will improve for you, though it may take some years to do so. provided, of course, that we do not kill the planet along the way.   try to find a way to be healthy and happy, even if your short term goals must change. try to use the internet to stay connected. try to stay as productive as possible given the constraints. apply for what positions there are, and for positions that you might not have considered if times were better.

Did Dean Koontz predict this outbreak in the book “The Eyes of Darkness” almost 40 years ago?,"no. there are some interesting coincidences in the 1981 fiction novel, which says  a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread around the globe  around the year 2020. modern editions of the book call the biological strain  wuhan-400,  and the current coronavirus outbreak started in wuhan, china.  but there are important differences between the book and reality. the original version of the book called the strain the  gorki-400,  in reference to a russian locality, before it was later changed to the  wuhan-400.  in the book, the virus was man-made, while scientists believe the novel coronavirus started in animals and jumped to humans. and in the book, the virus had a 100  mortality rate. early estimates of the mortality rate for this coronavirus outbreak range from 2-4 .",66
"Can the US increase its capacity for COVID-19 testing fast enough to accomplish simultaneously:

1) slowing the spread of disease to allow hospitals to provide care for the infected, and

2) minimizing the impact on the economy by allowing social distancing measures to be relaxed (e.g. reopening schools and restaurants)?

Is there a testing strategy that can accomplish this and what kind of resources would it require?

See a related question here.

EDIT: The ACLA expects US labs to be able to do 280,000 tests per week by April 1st (acla.com). What if the full weight of the federal government was behind this ramp-up in capability?

EDIT2: Tom Frieden recently wrote (vox.com) that ""testing is not a panacea,"" but he goes on to say that


  ""testing is absolutely, crucially important ...in areas with few or no cases, to inform containment and isolation strategies and facilitate contact tracing. Seattle would likely have had a much smaller outbreak if testing there had been widely available sooner.""


The containment strategy right now seems to be evolving toward one in which the entire country is on lockdown. Could we do more targeted (but equally effective) containment if we had a clearer picture of where the virus was? Note: Conversely, Frieden warns against widespread testing in areas of confirmed community transmission.
","well, i am no epidemiologist and have neither the required data nor their simulation tools at hand. however:  while testing is of course needed, i doubt that more testing can compensate for lack of distancing now.   also, there is japan with social distancing but low numbers of tests with slow curve, and south korea does not only test but also practice social distancing. there are also countries with lots of tests / inhabitant and heavy increases, italy for example.    how are screening tests different from what is done now.   slight disclaimer: i am in germany, so i know most details about the strategy here. afaik, it is not that different in the us, though. at least, also here people are complaining that they get tests refused and people are talking that test capacities are not unlimited - but it is not clear to me whether people are sent home who should be tested according to a doctor ordering that test or only those who go/drive to the test centers because they think they should be tested.   what is done right now in most countries  including italy, germany, south korea  is testing populations that are at a non-negligible risk of having contracted the virus. looking at the current  mar 19  numbers of positive tests among all tests  germany  and using lr  of better than 20  below in parentheses and expected 61 and lr- of better than 1/20  below in parentheses , expected 1/61  see long explanation here      pos tests/tests   ppv   1-npv ------------ ----------------- ------------- ------------------ usa   11     88    72      0.2    0.6     germany   3.9     south korea   2.8     64    36      0.05    0.01       ppv   probability of having sars-cov-2 after the test was positive 1-npv   probability of having sars-cov-2 after the test was negative    there is the implicit assumption that everyone is tested with that same test - which is not true, the south koreans by now may have better validation data, but i do not know this   screening means testing the normal population, which  still  has much lower prevalence of sars-cov-2. assuming the dark number is 99 x the known case count  i.e. we have 100x as many infected as positive test results ,     100 cases/inhabitants   ppv   1-npv ------------ ----------------------- ---------------- ------------------ low risk   1 in 10000   0.01     0.6     0.2       lt 0.01   usa   0.36     18     6.7      0.2    0.6     south korea   1.6     50    25      0.05    0.01     germany   2.0     54  28      0.03    0.1    germany    0.4     20     7.4       lt 0.01    0.02       with that assumed large dark numbers, germany and south korea would both have prevalences by now where using the existing test on the general population would start to make sense, as that would mean only 1 false positive case per true positive case. on the other hand, with prevalence in the single digit percent we would be in the region where frieden argues that testing of the general population does not make sense because it makes more sense to tell people to stay at home and away from contacts  which is the case for germany - and since the numbers are not growing as fast in south korea, their dark number is probably much lower .   in the low risk population  where frieden says testing would make sense , we would have only correct 1 out of about 200 positive cases. the ppv is for many practical considerations too low: screening needs very good tests, with very high sensitivity and specificity. sensitivity, because it is crucial here not to overlook truly positive cases, and specificity because the true positives are otherwise hidden in army of false positives.   to some extent, it is often possible to trade in some sensitivity for speificity and vice versa, e.g. with hiv test for blood donors, we do exactly this: we choose a very high sensitivity  so we can be sure not to infect anyone , and accept low specificity. so low, that a blood donor with positive hiv test is not even told that they were tested positive. instead, another test is applied  preferably by another manufacturer, because that adds more information than duplicate testing with the same kit , and if that is still positive, yet another one  a more elaborate one . after that iirc it is still more probable that the blood donor does not have hiv, but they is be looking into it and taking anothe blood sample.   and the decision for the donated blood is anyways to throw it away just to be on the safe side .   in principle we could do the same for sars-cov-2. chaining lab tests would mean an enormous burden to the health system of dealing with false positives  and possibly re-testing people  at a time where we do not have unlimited health resources and where the probability that the false positive anyways catches the virus next day or so is non-negligible. this makes this strategy that starts from testing low risk population a complete waste of ressources  even if we had unlimited capacity for testing . this may change in the future when we have tests where proper full validation has shown that they have very good specificity and a useful sensitivity.  what we do currently, is not very different though in principle: we do currently chain two independent tests, just that the lab test comes 2nd: first a doctor comes and tests whether you are high risk group because you had contact with confirmed cases  maybe even 2nd order contacts  or you show symptoms. then comes the lab test.   now the germany  line in the table above is an interesting additional point. the prevalence there is from the influenza sentinel data from week 11  last week . these are samples collected from people who were not sent to sars-cov-2 tests, but who went to a doctor with flu-like symptoms. 1 out of 251 was sars-cov-2 positive  and also influenza positive . the practically important point is: what did we miss because that sars-cov-2 case was overlooked  or would have been, had they not been in the sentinel sampling   actually, nothing: someone with the flu is told to stay at home and not infect anyone else pretty much like someone with sars-cov-2  particularly now since it would also relieve the health system if the seasonal influenza would be overcome a bit faster .   testing in areas with few infections  frieden does not propose screening, though: he proposes testing people who have been in contact with infected ones. which apparently did not work out in seattle, from what i read due to a lack of tests - but it did work out in germany where it allowed to completely stop the first  small  outbreak in january.  here, the  had  2nd order  contact to infected person  is the first test in the chain. this is a containment strategy, not a delay strategy.   in order for this to work, we need a two  ingredients : we must be able to trace the contacts  and better also 2nd order contacts , and people sent to quarantine must obey this quarantine.   comparison germany - south korea  mainly   ... the us is left as excercise to the informed reader   south korea apparently makes extensive use of autamated tracing of people in a fashion that would be completely unconstitutional in germany.  south korea does use social distancing: according to wikipedia they also shut down kindergardens, schools, and universities postponed their semester start. it did not have quite the same impact on overall economy that we see in germany now. their shutdown apparently was not all over the country, but earlier: they did that when they had 1000 cases.  apparently the population did a whole lot of that volountarily: the wiki page says the streets of daegu were empty on feb 20  when they had a total of 100 cases . in contrast, germany now has 15 k cases, and pretty much an official shutdown since the weekend in terms of kindergardens/schools/universities, pubs/clubs/... and apparently there is a sizeable sub-population that gives in to the urgent need of having their own big     parties since pubs are closed.  i can only speak from what i read in the news, i live in rural germany where my sports clubs canceled everything - but the neighbors had a 4 generation party  not that many people, but...  for their new house yesterday.  otoh, we have 8.5 confirmed cases per 100k inhabitants here, so even with that factor 100 for dark number, we are still below 1   prevalence now   what seems to be similar: in south korea young adults are the ones who spread the virus. similar in germany  more middle-aged initially  those who can afford to make skiing holidays in the alps , now the corona-parties are a young adult thing  i believe east asia is in general more on the alert than we were. mers and sars are cited as reasons, but of course overall high population density also means a permanently increased risk of infectious disesases. the wiki page about covid-19 in south korea indicates similar testing capacity for south korea  10k tests/day  51 mio inhabitants  and germany  16k tests/day  80 mio inhabitants    some countries with more or less flat curves and more or less testing  per mio inhabitants :   south korea so far done about 6000 tests / mio inhabitants italy 7300 / mio  maybe a bit late, but the main thing that was late in italy is that for a while they did not realize they had sars-cov-2  japan only 117/mio - but they have a very slow growth, still less than 1000 cases and their curve is decidedly flattening. japan distances socially since feb 25th  incl. e.g. to stay at home and not go to a doctor with only mild cold-like symptoms  at 167 cases in the whole country. singapore practices certain measures of social distancing since late january when they had  lt  10 cases.  did not find testing numbers, though  norway has 6440 tests/mio inhabitants. hopeful look at curve suggests that a slight flattening may take place. they started their lockdown at    700 cases, a bit more than a week ago. germany has    2100 tests/mio. 100 k tests were done in week 11, current capacity is about 30 k tests/day  is currently ramping up .  substantial flattening at the earliest expected in about 2 weeks  usa: according to wikipedia 300 / mio inhabitants, but the german newspaper cites 3.5x as many tests, that would be 1100 / mio inhabitants.  the difference may be whether private lab tests are counted or not     the dutch test  ... is about antibodies whereas the other tests look for virus rna. these tests again good for different things:   the dutch test tells whether there has been sufficient exposure to the virus  and sufficient time thereafter  to build antibodies.  once we know more about this, it may also tell whether one is immune against sars-cov-2  as they say, this is also important for getting an idea about the dark numbers of people who have been infected, but had so mild symptoms they did not realize it. the other tests tell whether you currently have the virus  and are contagious .  screening for active cases needs this test - the more so as the antibody test may become positive only a while after one is already contagious.    simulitis  the washington post has simulations of the spread of a  easier, more basic  disease called simulitis with 4 scenarios, ranging from no measures at all over a not quite perfect quarantine to moderate and extensive social distancing  25   and 10   of the population run around as always, rest stays where they are . i highly recommend reading, but here are some runs i just did:    brown are active cases, violet cured/immune and blue susceptible persons.  important findig for this question: in the first part of the quarantine simulation, the quarantine worked an noone got out  1st hump . note that this hump has roughly the same height as the moderate social distancing hump, and leaky quarantine is worse  though the simulation does not get any newly infected into a new quarantine - i would say the quarantine situation may be less like real quarantine and more like totally closed borders vs. not-quite-free movement between two countries .

Is there a country that’s really handled this well?,"governments worldwide have made major mistakes in trying to contain the outbreak. but as the virus spreads, south korea, singapore and china have been more effective than others at bringing it under control. south korea has aggressively monitored infections, such as by  checking the body temperatures  http://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/world/asia/daegu-south-korea- coronavirus.html  of all incoming and outgoing passengers at train stations and other places. officials operate drive-through testing centers and send out mobile phone alerts to citizens when new cases are reported in their districts. singapore, which has focused on early diagnosis, isolation and contact tracing, has also seen its rate of new cases drop. in china, new reported infections were cut to just 24 in a recent headcount  from more than 3,500 a day  http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/health/coronavirus-pandemic-who.html  in late january. in addition to strict travel limitations, chinese people are required to wear masks outdoors and have their temperatures checked at the doors of office buildings, stores, restaurants, hotels, apartments and public transit stations.",43
"Recently I traveled to India. While traveling back to the USA I got cwop on my F-1 visa in Doha. Then they sent me back to India. 

My question is: I have a one year valid OPT (optional practical training). Can I get a new visa for the OPT?
","cwop stands for cancelled without prejudice. the phrase without prejudice means that the reason for cancellation is not to have a negative impact on your future applications for visas or for admission to the us.  therefore, you ought to be able to apply for a new visa. however, i am not sure what the rules are surrounding opt  for that, you should ask at expatriates , so there may be something going on with that that would prevent it.  the odd thing here, however, is that visas are usually cancelled without prejudice in response to some sort of administrative action. for example, when one applies for a new visa before the old one is expired, the old visa will be cancelled without prejudice. a visa cancellation while the bearer is en route to the us would normally be a cancellation with prejudice, because the bearer has been found inadmissible for some reason.  on the other hand, if you were prevented from flying to the us because of the travel ban related to covid-19, i would think that your visa should not have been cancelled at all.  so i wonder whether there is some additional fact that you have not mentioned that might explain exactly what happened. if so, that might also have a bearing on the likelihood that a future visa application would succeed.

"As reported on the BBC today:


  The [US] president accused the WHO of being ""very China-centric"" and said they ""really blew"" their pandemic response.
  
  Dr Tedros has now dismissed the comments, insisting: ""We are close to every nation, we are colour-blind.""
  
  After first attacking the WHO on Tuesday, President Trump renewed his criticism at his press briefing on Wednesday, saying the organization must ""get its priorities right"". He said the US would conduct a study to decide whether the US would continue paying contributions [...]
  
  On Tuesday, President Trump had said the WHO appeared to be ""very biased toward China"".
  
  ""They called it wrong. They really - they missed the call,"" he said. ""And we're going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO. We're going to put a very powerful hold on it, and we're going to see.""


Clearly (from the same article) Tedros has rejected the notion that the WHO has a China-bias, but have they said anything more specifically rejecting the other accusations, i.e. that they ""really blew"" their response and that they ""missed the call"" (when the pandemic started)?

Similarly,


  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of Trump, vowed there would not be any funding for the WHO in the next Senate appropriations bill.
  
  ""I'm in charge of the appropriations subcommittee. I'm not going to support funding the WHO under its current leadership. They've been deceptive, they've been slow, and they've been Chinese apologists,"" Graham said in an interview with Fox News.
  
  Last week, Republican Senator Marco Rubio called for the resignation of WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, saying ""he allowed Beijing to use the WHO to mislead the global community"".


These latter accusations from Republican senators are even more direct and specific (than ""blew""), accusing the WHO of deliberate deception, in cahoots with Beijing, besides being ""slow"".

Thanks to @ItalianPhilosophers for finding this, Fox News has been emphasizing this bit in their coverage of the Republican-WHO spat:


  Last month, Taiwan accused the WHO of ignoring a warning it sent in December about human-to-human transmission of coronavirus. “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China,” the organization tweeted in January.


Which may be what the US Republicans are alluding to with ""slow"".

Somewhat more obvious/predictible, Fox News is critical of the WHO's criticism of the US travel ban:


  the WHO responded to Trump’s travel ban on foreign nationals coming from China by saying that “travel bans to affected areas or denial of entry to passengers coming from affected areas are usually not effective in preventing the importation” of coronavirus cases and instead could have a “have a significant economic and social impact.”
  
  Criticism of the travel ban and other pro-China statements have brought renewed questions about the U.S. funding the agency.


(The latter issue has been the topic of two separate questions here e.g., so I don't want to reash that.)

If the WHO itself has not replied to those (other) allegations of Trump/Republicans/Fox-News/Taiwan more specifically, has the WHO's record in this respect been defended by others, e.g. has the press said anything in support/defence of WHO's actions in response to the pandemic that can address some of Trump's accusations (from those quotes that I have emphasized)?
","for what is worth it, al jazeera quoted a third-party defence of the who:    jeremy konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the center for global development, said the last thing the us and the who need right now is this sort of a fight.     it is a distraction from the need to focus on defeating this pandemic,  he told al jazeera.     no virus has a nationality and it is down to how the countries have handled the threat. the core information that was needed to understand this risk was available by the end of january - and it was available through the who. that information still is very accurate in terms of transmissibility and lethality of this disease, so that really should have been all for any country to take it seriously,  konyndyk said.     in general, i think the who has been further ahead of the curve and understanding the risk of the virus than trump is own administration has, so i do not think who is to be blamed for the us is sluggish response.     and also added this on their own:    the who declared covid-19 a public health emergency on january 30, nearly a month before trump tweeted:  the coronavirus is very much under control in the usa,  and a full 43 days before he declared a national emergency in the us.   i will accept a better answer in the sense that i asked in the question, i.e. if the who themselves explicitly defended their record/actions in response to those republican accusations.    similarly the guardian has an article defending the who with extensive quotes from experts and among those they have quoted a who official too  lawrence gostin :    who is total annual budget is about  2.5bn, and contributions from member states have not significantly increased over three decades.     the who is budget is around the equivalent of a large us hospital, which is utterly incommensurate with its global responsibilities,  said lawrence gostin, a public health law professor at georgetown university.  he also holds a who position, as made clear later in the article.   so, if the us president were a global health leader, he would be leading a call to at minimum double the who budget in the face of this pandemic.   ...      i have been a longstanding critic and i have described their performance on ebola as catastrophic. but i think overall their performance on this outbreak has been, not perfect, but pretty good,  ashish jha, a public health professor at harvard, said.     they have been very transparent as much as they have known the data. they have had daily calls, they have been very clear about the severity of this illness, and how the global community has to respond.     anthony fauci, the director of the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, and robert redfield, the head of the centers for disease control and prevention, took part in who conference calls about coronavirus from 7 january, according to sources familiar with the conversations.    gavin yamey, the director of duke university is center for policy impact in global health, said:  if the united states had followed the who is very clear advice on identifying cases, isolating cases and conducting contact tracing, then it would not be in the appalling situation that it is in today.     despite its declaration, the who did not advocate travel restrictions of the sort imposed by trump a day later on non-american travellers arriving from china. the president has pointed to this as an example of bad advice. but gostin, who is director of the who centre on global health law, said that the organisation cannot generally call for travel bans under international law - and such bans can be counterproductive, leading countries to withhold vital information for fear of economic isolation.     to blame the who for acting on the basis of international law and science in ways that are entirely consistent with what who practices have been for decades is the height of hypocrisy,  he said.    trump claimed that his ban  shut down  intercontinental transmission of the virus, but an abc television investigation found that there were 3,200 flights from china to the us in the critical period between december and march.   the guardian article does grant the who critics some points on taiwan:    the us president is accusations that the who is  china-centric  have more resonance with public health scholars. the who has largely excluded taiwan from its discussions, and dodged questions about the taiwanese response, which has been one of the most effective. but because of pressure from beijing - which sees taiwan as an integral part of its territory and opposes any form of recognition - the blindspot is a un-wide phenomenon.     i think the effusive praise for china, in the early days, was probably unnecessary,  jha said.    amanda glassman, the executive vice-president and senior fellow at the center for global development, said a deeper problem is the who is low budget and relatively toothless structure. unlike the nuclear watchdog, the international atomic energy agency, it has no redress against governments that do not cooperate.     it operates in countries at the pleasure and permission of the host country governments. so in the case of china, to be allowed to enter china, it was a negotiation to get there,  glassman said.

","although the latter term is less publicized in the mass media, a who page basically calls it official too, although it was the ictv that came up with it:    viruses are named based on their genetic structure to facilitate the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines. virologists and the wider scientific community do this work, so viruses are named by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses  ictv .    diseases are named to enable discussion on disease prevention, spread, transmissibility, severity and treatment. human disease preparedness and response is who is role, so diseases are officially named by who in the international classification of diseases  icd .    ictv announced  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  sars-cov-2   as the name of the new virus on 11 february 2020. this name was chosen because the virus is genetically related to the coronavirus responsible for the sars outbreak of 2003. while related, the two viruses are different.     who announced  covid-19  as the name of this new disease on 11 february 2020, following guidelines previously developed with the world organisation for animal health  oie  and the food and agriculture organization of the united nations  fao .    who and ictv were in communication about the naming of both the virus and the disease.   so yeah, the two names originate from different organizations  as far as i can tell the ictv is not subordinated to the who in any way , but they apparently held some talks on the matter. nonetheless, the who does seem a little displeased with including  sars  in the virus name...    from a risk communications perspective, using the name sars can have unintended consequences in terms of creating unnecessary fear for some populations, especially in asia which was worst affected by the sars outbreak in 2003.     for that reason and others, who has begun referring to the virus as  the virus responsible for covid-19  or  the covid-19 virus  when communicating with the public. neither of these designations are intended as replacements for the official name of the virus as agreed by the ictv.   likewise, some virologists were displeased with the who name. in the later published sars-cov-2  naming  paper of ictv is csg  coronaviridae study group  they do  mend fences  however, saying that:    by uncoupling the naming conventions used for coronaviruses and the diseases that some of them cause in humans and animals, we wish to support the who in its efforts to establish disease names in the most appropriate way.  ...  the further advancement of naming conventions is also important because the ongoing discovery of new human and animal viruses by next-generation sequencing technologies can be expected to produce an increasing number of viruses that do not  easily  fit the virus-disease model that was widely used in the pre-genomic era  ... . having now established different names for the causative virus  sars-cov-2  and the disease  covid-19 , the csg hopes that this will raise awareness in both the general public and public health authorities regarding the difference between these two entities. the csg promotes this clear distinction because it will help improve the outbreak management and also reduces the risk of confusing virus and disease, as has been the case over many years with sars-cov  the virus  and sars  the disease .

"Has anyone had success getting airlines to issue refunds, or at least extend the value of unused tickets, for upcoming travel that had been booked long before the COVID-19 outbreak?  

My question specifically concerns United Airlines and non-refundable tickets to destinations that are not otherwise covered by any explicit guidance.  I'd be interested in hearing about others though.

It seems like airlines are offering flexibility for new travel bookings but not ones made a while back.  And travel insurance will only cover you if your travel is individually impacted due to illness or quarantine.  
","your question is very generic, so i answer in general:  in general if a government  or an airline  does not stop travellers or planes, you will have no direct refund. it means that both think that there is no danger.  so usually it is recommended to have a travel insurance  for important/expensive travel, like far away for holidays . on the other hand, also a travel insurance may not allow you to cancel: it depends on the kind of insurance you get: some  the more expensive  does not ask reasons, other are more restrictive  and again, if you are not in a risk category, and there is no recommendation from government  they will not refund you.  on the other hand, this is a special  and global  thing, so to get good news coverage, they may end to refund you. cruise lines are starting this  also for old bookings , let is hope also the airlines will follow.  the reason about having such rules for new booking: they are trying to convince new people to book. without such incentives, many passengers will not book  and after booking many will travel anyway , this will keep cashflow. old booking: they have already paid, so if they do something, it is just to get good publicity.  because the airlines will reduce flights, you may hope that they will effect your flight, so that you can cancel/rebook  or having credit for next flight .

"Today, Hungary's parliament voted by 137 to 53 to enact the new COVID-19 bill, which apparently grants Prime Minister Viktor Orbán sweeping powers, in order to allow Hungary to deal with the crisis. The move, which includes no time limit on the extraordinary powers has been criticised by the Council of Europe; the Secretary General wrote in an letter to Mr Orbán that although ""drastic measures"" need to be taken:


  An indefinite and uncontrolled state of emergency cannot guarantee
  that the basic principles of democracy will be observed and that the
  emergency measures restricting fundamental human rights are strictly
  proportionate to the threat which they are supposed to counter.


Although there has been much criticism of the bill,  I have been unable to find precise details of the powers which it grants to Orbán and his government. What specific rights are being curtailed that the bill's critics find objectionable?
","the implications seem to be indefinite near-dictatorship for so long as viktor orban chooses. for those who are interested, an  unofficial, i believe  english translation of the bill can be found here.  under the new legislation, by-elections are suspended and orban can rule by decree, suspend enforcement of laws, and arrest people for years under vague charges of  publicizing distorted facts  or  violating quarantine :    the hungarian parliament on monday voted by a two-thirds majority to allow the government of prime minister viktor orban to rule by decree without a set time limit.    while the new legislation remains in place, no by-elections can be held and orban is government will be able to suspend the enforcement of certain laws. plus, individuals who publicize what are viewed as untrue or distorted facts -- and which could interfere with the protection of the public, or could alarm or agitate a large number of people -- now face several years in jail.   though advertised as  emergency powers , these new powers will last indefinitely and can only be removed with the approval of the president:    the new rules can only be lifted with another two-thirds vote of the parliament and a presidential signature    hungary is viktor orban wins vote to rule by decree - politico   the new york times provides similar information:    in hungary, a new law has granted prime minister viktor orban the power to sidestep parliament and suspend existing laws. mr. orban, who declared a state of emergency this month, now has the sole power to end the emergency. ...    the law will permanently amend two articles of the criminal code that will further limit freedom of expression and penalize people for breaching quarantine orders. it will also suspend all elections and referendums.    under one measure, anyone who disseminates information that could hinder the government is response to the epidemic could face up to five years in prison. the legislation gives broad latitude to the public prosecutor to determine what counts as distorted or false information.    for autocrats, coronavirus is a chance to grab even more power - the new york times     the independent hungarian newspaper index has more detail.  the government can expand emergency declarations indefinitely without parliamentary approval:    the new law allows the government to make these extensions themselves indefinitely, or at least until parliament decides to revoke this authorisation before the state of emergency is over   it gives the government vague and expansive powers to arrest people for  false or distorting  speech:    the new law also introduces a vaguely worded new paragraph to the already existing offence of scaremongering in the criminal code, which opponents of the law say could threaten critical press:       anyone who, under a special legal order, in public, utters or spreads statements known to be false or statements distorting true facts shall be punishable by imprisonment between 1 to 5 years if done in a manner capable of hindering or derailing the effectiveness of the response effort.      and it give them the power to suspend laws and cancel elections:    the coronavirus act also introduces a number of other changes to the constitutional order of the country:      the government will be allowed to take steps beyond the extraordinary measures listed in the disaster relief act and suspend the application of certain laws by decree if necessary and proportional to protect citizens  health, life, property, rights, and to secure the stability of the economy in connection with the pandemic. ...  no local or national elections or referendums can be held until the end of the state of emergency, elections and referendums already scheduled will take place after the special legal order ends. municipal councils dissolved during the state of emergency stay in place until the end of the special legal order.      hungarian coronavirus act passes, granting viktor orban unprecedented emergency powers - index    ",131
"What would be the situation for a visitor should they contract Covid-19 and require hospitalisation whilst in the US?


Would it be classed as an emergency or secondary care? Does the US provide emergency care free of charge?
Do charges vary e.g. by state or hospital?


My question was prompted by this one Is it safe for an ESTA waiver visitor to return to Japan until the corona virus has been contained?, which made me wonder about the financial risks of extending a visit, given that many travel insurance policies limit the length of each trip. For example, I have an annual travel policy but cover is limited to 45 days. It also excludes any epidemic or pandemic.
","answering my own question:   as stated in a comment by  djclayworth, the us does not provide emergency care free of charge. charges do vary between hospitals, and us healthcare is the most expensive in the world. visitors contemplating extending their stay in the us because of worries about the extent of the epidemic in their country of residence should check that they have adequate insurance for the entire length of stay, starting from the date they arrived in the us.

"For this question, we will define surveillance as large scale random Covid-19 testing. 

It is my understanding that: 


surveillance enables the sorting of asymptomatic patients to be immediately isolated when infected (and reducing further infections).
the USA does is not applying said strategy
said strategy was successfully engaged in Korea


HBR indicates: 


  “Testing is the biggest problem that we’re facing,” Peter Slavin,
  president of Massachusetts General Hospital, said recently in a
  roundtable on Covid-19 at Harvard Medical School. While South Korea
  had tested about 4,000 people per million of its population at the
  time, the United States had just run five tests per million — despite
  the fact that they both reported their first cases at essentially the
  same time (on January 21 and 20). The discrepancy was surprising
  because the genome of the virus had been available since January and
  scientists had figured out the diagnostics shortly thereafter, using
  proven molecular methods first discovered in the 1970s.""


South Korea has a population of ~ 51M and the USA population is ~330M.

This article indicates Jacksonville drive-in testing is limited to 250 tests per day.  


Why is surveillance not implemented at scale in the USA?  
If the USA does not have testing at scale, why is this the case?

Can I exercise outside? What about going to the park?,"yes, but do not forget about social distancing.    regular exercise can help keep you physically and mentally healthy during the outbreak. you should feel free to talk a walk, go to the park and get outside, but maintain at least 6 feet between yourself and others during that time. do not pack into a crowded park, beach or hiking trail. instead, head to an area with fewer people or exercise at off-hours, when not as many people are out and about.    since covid-19 can live on hard surfaces, and most playgrounds are not cleaned and disinfected regularly, you may want to reconsider bringing your child there, especially if you live in an area with ongoing coronavirus transmissions. if you do decide to go to the playground, make sure your child stays at least 6 feet away from other children.",140
"A previous thread on Bioinformatics StackExchange citing an article by the Economist which references a cartoon of predictive outcomes by the CDC (Economist article on coronavirus) suggests a model in epidemiology using the ""basic reproductive rate"", commonly known as R0. Although I'm no bioinformatician, I imagine that one could tweak a model based on similar infections like SARS and HDN1. Yet, I found no models predicting or giving confidence intervals for the spread of coronavirus. I wonder if the the data is still too sparse, e.g. we don't know if it's seasonal (mentioned in the above thread) and we cannot infer the virulence.

Would such a model be reliable? If not, how many months of data would we need to reliably use a model predicting the spread?
","the original r0 calculation was developed in the early 1900s to model malaria transmission and is known as the ross-macdonald model so your idea is over 100 years old. the model was very famous for identifying the optimal strategy for malarial control by targeting the adult mosquito rather than the mosquito larvae. what it said was reducing the mosquito population and reducing malaria transmission were two different issues. so the bednet strategy is based in this idea and particularly spraying the inside of houses with insecticide.  r0 was famously used in the 1980s to predict the hiv pandemic when who thought it would remain localised in africa.   the problem with r0 and coronaviruses is we do not know the asymptomatic population who could also transmit the virus.   this population is potentially very large. epidemiologists will attempt extrapolation from cruise ship quarrentine, eg the diamond princess where everyone is tested to understand this transmission parameter and project this onto the rest of the planet. clearly this could have limitations or inaccuracies. the other issue i am baffled by is seasonal transmission and whether this will occur with covid-19.   one thing r0 of covid-19 will identify is the latent period transmission which occurs before the symptoms, i.e. the incubation period. essentially, people with cough/mild symptoms before they self isolate and become really ill with a lung infection will transmit the virus. in this context r0 will be/was very influential for understanding when to move between quarrentine and containment phases of the pandemic.

Can chlorine solutions also be used?,"chlorine solutions are strongly discouraged as they carry a higher risk of hand irritation and ill health effects from making and diluting chlorine solutions, including eye irritation and respiratory problems. in addition, there is a risk of loss of antimicrobial effect if exposed to sunlight or heat. preparing chlorine solutions requires training to reach the correct dose of 0.05  with varying strengths of bleach available in the private sector. even if stored at a cool dry place with a lid away from sunlight, they have to be renewed daily. in comparison simple soapy water solution do not have any of the above-mentioned health risks and complications including loss of antiviral effect due to heat or sunlight. the antiviral effect of soapy water is due to the oily surface membrane of the covid-virus that is dissolved by soap, killing the virus.",8
Would a scarf work?,"probably not as well as a mask that fits closely to your face.  you can imagine if you put a loosely knit scarf with lots of holes in it ... that would not be very effective,  says dr. michael klompas, an infectious disease physician at brigham and women is hospital. the goal is to create a barrier that catches droplets and keeps others from coming in, so you want coverage that is tightly woven and close-fitting.",56
"Due to the coronavirus outbreak, my university has tentatively canceled all live forms of live education, including exams. Instead, they have decided to hold exams through an online proctoring software (third-party), which requires access to the computer webcam, microphone, screen, and browsing history to work.

I am concerned about my data privacy in the context of these exams, and am wondering what my rights are and how I can exercise them. Specifically, I am wondering whether I can refuse the collection of my personal data through the online proctoring software, and whether the university may reprimand me for doing so.

"Given the lack of critical assessment in the US media of China's massive quarantine, I think that there are many people in the US who would view it acceptable to shut down a major American city to prevent the spreading of an outbreak.  However, I worry that no one is considering the consequences of such action.  

With major parts of the economy no longer functioning, people would have difficulty with things like finding child care.  This has trickle down effects, such as pharmacy staff staying at home with their children.  This may lead to lethal consequences.  

Examples of trickle down effects:


Cancer survivors can't access health care (this is currently happening in China). 
Lack of access to medicine.  This can be deadly to people with severe chronic conditions (e.g. heart disease).
Lack of social support (e.g. no one is checking in on Grandma).


Question: 

Do policy makers (in either China or the US) consider the unintended consequences of large quarantines?  If so whose advising them and studying those effects?  Is the decision to quarantine based off of a process or is it based off of an executive leader's 'intuition'.  

My 'intuition' is that these unintentional effects may be killing more people than covid 19.

","in the us there are two federal agencies the centers for disease control and prevention and the federal emergency management agency that have larges staffs of physicians, epidemiologists, public health, and disaster management professionals. those staffs spend a lot of their time worrying about questions like this, and gaming out different scenarios, just like the military games out battle strategies. there is also a large academic community of public health specialists that study problems like this. see for example these academic papers:  quarantine, isolation and the duty of easy rescue in public health    we address the issue of whether, why and under what conditions,  quarantine and isolation are morally justified, with a particular  focus on measures implemented in the developing world. we argue that  the benefits of quarantine and isolation justify some level of  coercion or compulsion by the state, but that the state should be able  to provide the strongest justification possible for implementing such  measures.   the challenge of mandatory evacuation: providing for and deciding for    insufficient attention has been given to the ethical and legal  questions surrounding mandatory evacuation in disasters and  emergencies. we argue that mandatory evacuation orders entail a  governmental duty both to provide for people and to decide for people:  government must trigger the provision of critical resources as well as  vigorous and persistent efforts to persuade reluctant citizens to  leave.   of course the political powers might choose to not to follow the advice of their professional staff or outside professionals, but that comes with grave political risks if the situation goes south. the political powers might also receive contradictory advice from different groups of professionals. which experts should they listen to   there is also the chance that even with the best of intentions and the best available information, the experts will make the wrong call, or apply the  lessons of the last battle  in the wrong situation.   these are hard questions. for example, in in august 2005 hurricane katrina hit new orleans and over 1800 people were killed. the governments of louisiana and new orleans we broadly criticized for not fully evacuating the city. later in 2005 hurricane rita was projected to hit houston and a mandatory evacuation was ordered. dozens of people died in the evacuation of houston, from heat stroke, accidents, and a tragic bus fire. as it turned out, hurricane rita struck houston only a passing blow, and fewer people died in the storm than in the evacuation. new lesson learned: do not evacuate, shelter in place, evacuate only those most at risk. then in 2017 hurricane harvey hit houston, causing massive flooding, and requiring the rescue of thousands of people trapped in floodwaters. and afterwards everyone was asking why did not houston evacuate .  predicting the future is hard.

"One could fit an exponential in many different ways. This post suggests doing the down-and-dirty lm on the log of the response variable.

What are the pros/cons and domains of applicability for these different approaches? Do these methods differ in how well or in what way they calculate confidence intervals?

","one of the differences is the likelihoods for each model. in case readers can not remember, the likelihood encapsulates assumptions about the conditional distribution of the data. in the case of covid-19, this would be the distribution of infections  or reported new cases, or deaths, etc  on the given day. whatever we want the outcome to be, let is call it  y . thus, the conditional distribution  e.g. the number of new cases today  would be  y vert t   think of this as  y  conditioned on  t  .   in the case of taking the log and then performing lm, this would mean that   log y  vert t  sim  mathcal n   mu x ,  sigma 2   . equivalently, that  y  is lognormal given  t . the reason we do linear regression on   log y   is because on the log scale, the conditional mean is independent of the variance, where as the mean of the log normal is also a function of the variance. so pro: we know how to do linear regression, but con this approach makes linear regression assumptions on the log scale which can always be assessed but might be hard to theoretically justify  another con is that people do not realize that predicting on the log scale and then taking the exponential actually biases predictions by a factor if   exp  sigma 2/2   if i recall correctly. so when you make predictions from a log normal model, you need to account for this.  so far as i understand, nls assumes a gaussian likelihood as well, so in this model   y  vert t  sim  mathcal n   exp  beta 0    beta t ,  sigma 2  . except now, we let the conditional mean of the outcome be non-linear. this can be a pain because no confidence intervals are not bounded below by 0, so your model might estimate a negative count of infections. obviously, that can not happen. when the count of infections  or whatever  is larger, then a gaussian can justifiable. but when things are just starting, then this probably is not the best likelihood. furthermore, if you fit your data using nls, you will see that it fits later data very well but not early data. that is because misfitting later data incurrs larger loss and the goal of nls is to minimize this loss. the approach with glm frees is a little and allows us to control the conditional distribution as well as the form of the conditional mean through the link function. in this model,  y  vert t  sim  text gamma   mu x ,  phi   with   mu x    g  -1   beta 0    beta 1  . we call  g  the link, and for the case of log link   mu x     exp  beta 0    beta 1 t  . pro these models are much more expressive, but i think the power comes from the ability to perform inference with a likelihood which is not normal. this lifts a lot of the restrictions, for example symmetric confidence intervals. the con is that you need a little more theory to understand what is going on.

"Pretty much the title, I am looking for some more in-depth explanation of the models used in the papers from Imperial College and The Lancet. In the second one, they are using something called a branching process model, but they are sampling from strange distributions (like serial interval

"At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization initially opposed countries instituting travel or trade restrictions.



Why did they oppose these policies at that time? Is there any evidence that non-medical considerations such as political pressure played a role in the World Health Organization's decision?
","probably because prior who research was rather skeptical of their ultimate effectiveness:     screening and quarantining entering travelers at international borders did not substantially delay virus introduction in past pandemics, except in some island countries, and will likely be even less effective in the modern era.   that paper was co-authored  on behalf of the who  by employees of the  us  cdc  lead author actually , the ecdc, the uk is hpa, australian dha, and some of who is own employees. so you could say it was a fairly broad consensus at the time it was written  2006 .  the who has actually explained/defended their reasoning in relation to the covid-19 outbreak in more detail in a february press release:    who continues to advise against the application of travel or trade restrictions to countries experiencing covid-19 outbreaks.    in general, evidence shows that restricting the movement of people and goods during public health emergencies is ineffective in most situations and may divert resources from other interventions. furthermore, restrictions may interrupt needed aid and technical support, may disrupt businesses, and may have negative social and economic effects on the affected countries. however, in certain circumstances, measures that restrict the movement of people may prove temporarily useful, such as in settings with few international connections and limited response capacities.    travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic may only be justified at the beginning of an outbreak, as they may allow countries to gain time, even if only a few days, to rapidly implement effective preparedness measures. such restrictions must be based on a careful risk assessment, be proportionate to the public health risk, be short in duration, and be reconsidered regularly as the situation evolves.    travel bans to affected areas or denial of entry to passengers coming from affected areas are usually not effective in preventing the importation of cases but may have a significant economic and social impact. since who declaration of a public health emergency of international concern in relation to covid-19, and as of 27 february, 38 countries have reported to who additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic in relation to travel to and from china or other countries, ranging from denial of entry of passengers, visa restrictions or quarantine for returning travellers. several countries that denied entry of travellers or who have suspended the flights to and from china or other affected countries, are now reporting cases of covid-19.    temperature screening alone, at exit or entry, is not an effective way to stop international spread, since infected individuals may be in incubation period, may not express apparent symptoms early on in the course of the disease, or may dissimulate fever through the use of antipyretics  in addition, such measures require substantial investments for what may bear little benefits.  ...    i have not found more recent press releases on this matter, especially after the us and the eu have imposed much more wider travel bans. i do wonder the extent to which the who might have reconsidered that initial approach...  aside, comment on the question... i wonder why you found it necessary to use  that guy from india  as the motivator for this question when  in the us  a poll published on march 26 says...    in thinking about specific steps that have been announced to address the coronavirus outbreak, majorities of republicans and democrats view a range of measures as necessary to stem the spread of the virus. for example, overwhelming majorities of both republicans  96   and democrats  94   say restricting international travel to the u.s. is necessary.

"As a response for the Covid-19 pandemic, my university built an electronic platform, and is now ordering professors to share their courses on it. 

The school platform is open to the public, so I'd rather not share my documents on it. I've been using Google Classroom to share content with my students. 

Can I rightfully refuse to use the school's platform?
","  can i rightfully refuse to use the school is platform    tl dr: legally, probably not, but you are still more or less in the right according to the norms of academia.  longer answer:  this is not so much about rights in the legal sense. the underlying context is that there is a longstanding tradition in academia that faculty own the rights to written  and other  media they create as part of their work. this is the case in the us where these rights are pretty universally respected as far as i am aware, and in many other countries, and is true despite the fact that legally, in the us at least, employers in general can  and, outside of academia, generally do  assert ownership of all intellectual property generated by employees in a work context.  in other words, academic institutions have quite intentionally and explicitly given up some of the legal ownership rights they are in principle entitled to. as far as i understand, the guiding philosophy here is that faculty exercise a lot more freedom and control over what kind of materials they produce compared to employees in other sectors. that means the work is regarded as being of a more personal, creative nature, and it was decided long ago that that should mean that faculty would be the owners of the work.  note: i am talking specifically about copyright  for other forms of ip like patent rights, a quite different philosophy and different policies typically apply.   coming back to your question: i think you are quite right to be concerned. your university is at the very least showing itself as somewhat deaf to these very old and well-established ideas. but can you  rightfully refuse   legally, that is less clear. but it would be quite reasonable to express a concern. at my university the administration has provided reassurance to faculty that their copyright over teaching materials would be respected during the covid-19 crisis, and we were given quite specific explanations on how our rights would be balanced against the need to deliver our teaching remotely, including providing recordings, what steps we can take to prevent students from sharing our materials, and more. perhaps by raising the issue you and your colleagues can push your own administration to also think this through a bit more.  let me finish by encouraging you to also adopt a more flexible and tolerant mindset. all of us are called upon these days to get out of our comfort zone and appear in online videos and recordings, use online platforms with awful records on privacy, and generally engage in activities that in normal times we might consider distasteful and privacy-violating. we do this with the understanding that exceptional times call for exceptional measures, and that the highest priority right now is to keep the lights on at our institutions. as i said, i think your concern is reasonable and probably you can reach some sensible understanding with your administration about your class materials. but while you discuss the issue with them, try to keep some perspective and not make yourself too much of a pain in the butt. as important and valid as this is, people do have worse things to worry about these days.

"I have tried to find an answer to this but have not found anything after multiple attempts.

The question on the table is if the human body is able to produce an immune response to the COVID-19 virus if one has been exposed? This would apply most specifically to persons that have been tested positive but have ""survived"" (i.e. not having succumbed to the serious lung complications that have caused deaths for some persons). 

A follow on question that comes from this is if the human body is able to mount a suitable defense does the current practice of keeping people in quarantine for two weeks allow for this defense to reach full effectiveness?

"During July 2019, I booked flight UA7938 for March 30 through United Airlines for my honeymoon. With everything involving Covid-19 happening, I'm trying to see if I can get a refund for the ticket or an extension on the ticket. My main issue is that I do not know who is responsible for a potential refund. United is the marketing airline and ANA is the operating airline.

United is waiving change fees for flights booked prior to March, which I can apply to my ticket online, but I would have to travel before July 2020. I don't know what kind of travel I can do before July and I do not want my money to go to waste. On the other hand, ANA has been issuing refunds for all international flights booked prior to March. Do I follow United's policies or can I follow ANA's? Has anyone had luck with similar situations?
","when you buy an airline ticket there are up to 3 separate airlines that can be involved for each leg of the flight. these are common known as :   the  marketing carrier . this is the airline who is flight number is on the ticket/itinerary. the  operating carrier . this is the airline who is aircraft will actually fly the flight. the  ticketing carrier . this is the airline that actually sold you the ticket.    the ticketing carrier will be the same for all legs of the flight on the same ticket. the other two can vary from leg-to-leg   in many cases, all 3 will be the same - you buy a ticket from airline xx, for flight xx123, which is flown by airline xx themselves.  in your case, all 3 are not the same. ua7938 is marketed as a united airlines flight  thus the ua flight number , but the operating carrier is ana. what we can not tell from the information you have provided is who the ticketing carrier is - and that is the one that actually matters here   if you purchased your ticket directly from an airline website, then you can be fairly sure that is the ticketing carrier. if you purchased it from a travel agency, then it is a little more complex. in general, if all flights on a ticket are for the same marketing airline  eg, all uaxxx flight numbers  then most likely the ticket was issued by that airline.  to be certain, you will need to check the ticket itself. in your email confirmation  or on the relevant website for where you bought the ticket  you should find a  ticket number  which is generally around 13 numbers long. the first 3 digits in this number show who the ticketing carrier is. if this number is 016, then your ticket was issued by united airlines. if it is 205, ana. if it is 014, it is air canada.  now, back to your original question. the policies that apply in a situation like this will be the policy of the ticketing carrier. that carrier might be influenced by the operating or marketing carriers policies, but officially it is the ticketing carrier that you have paid for your ticket, and it is them that has your money up until the time that you actually take the flight.  in your case it is most likely that united is the ticket carrier so it would be their policies that apply - but you will need to check the ticket number to be sure  ",45

"According to statistics published by the FBI, March 2020 saw the highest ever number of NICS firearms background checks performed, at 3,740,688, an increase of 33% from February. The FBI itself notes that this does not equate to a one-to-one correlation to the number of gun sales that have taken place, but it is at least a rough indicator that the number of gun sales has also seen a large increase.

This trend held true in practically every state of the US, with the exception of Kentucky.

What are the political factors which have led to such a large increase?

"There has been quite a bit of misinformation flowing about COVID-19, some of it has even been reported on major news agencies, the one most heard about being Fox and Friends claiming, falsely, that the ability to hold your breath for 19 seconds is a good indicator of COVID-19 infection; but this is hardly limited to one show or wrong fact.  Given the threat of COVID-19, and how each infection increases the risk of future infections exponentially, the misinformation being spread could realistically put lives at risk.

Now I'm not suggesting anyone be punished for COVID-19 misinformation specifically, for many reasons.  However, it got me wondering at a more general level if there are forces in place to handle more direct and blatant spread of dangerous misinformation via the news.

It does make me wonder what laws exist for intentional spread of misinformation.

","you choosing to remove her as your dependent, or you choosing to not have claimed her as your dependent in the first place when you filed, will not allow her to get the stimulus payment. the restriction is that she cannot get the stimulus payment if she can be claimed by somebody else as a dependent, not that she actually was claimed by somebody else as a dependent. the fact that you have a choice to claim her as your dependent or not, implies that she can be claimed by you as a dependent  i.e. she meets the conditions in the law to qualify as your dependent . in that case, she cannot get the stimulus payment, even if you do not actually claim her as a dependent on your tax return.

"Given the current covid-19 situation where the home country (India) has stopped all international flights, how can one (65+ year old) extend their B2 visa or stay after I-94 extension? Any help is appreciated.

I called up USCIS regarding the same and they told me it usually takes around 6 months to process these applications. My main concern is what if the application is rejected and the applicant has already overstayed their original VISA expiry date, will it be considered illegal? What happens if it is considered illegal?

","she can file form i-539 for extension of status at any point up until her status expires. the application just has to be officially received by uscis before her status expires.  if she filed her extension of status application before her status expired, she can stay in the us while it is pending even if her status expires in the meantime. the government will generally not deport her for being out of status while her extension of status is pending. in addition, she does not accrue  unlawful presence  while her timely-filed, non-frivolous extension of status application is pending, even if her i-94 is expired. if her extension of status is approved, she will be retroactively granted status from when her last status expired.  see this brochure:    what if i file for an extension of stay on time but uscis does not make  a decision before my i-94 expires     your lawful nonimmigrant status ends, and you are out of status, when  your form i-94 expires, even if you have timely applied to extend your  nonimmigrant status. generally, as a matter of discretion, uscis will  defer any removal proceedings until after the petition is adjudicated  and uscis decides your request for extension of nonimmigrant status.   ...     even though you are not actually in a lawful nonimmigrant status, you  do not accrue  unlawful presence  for purposes of inadmissibility  under section 212 a  9  b  of the immigration and nationality act,  while your extension of status application is pending if it was filed  prior to the expiration of your form i-94.     ...     if your application for an extension of stay is approved, the approval  will relate back to the date your form i-94 expired, and your status  while your application is pending will then be considered to have been  lawful.    if your application is denied, you may be required to cease employment  and depart the united states immediately.    in addition, any nonimmigrant visa in your passport granted in  connection with your classification becomes void. once your visa is  void, you must submit any new visa application at a u.s. consulate in  your home country  not a third country, except in rare instances as  determined by the u.s. department of state .   if her timely-filed, non-frivolous extension of status application is denied, and her i-94 has expired, and she is still in the us on the date of the denial, she will start to accrue  unlawful presence  from the date of the denial.   see afm chapter 40.9.2 b  3  d  iv :    if a timely filed, non-frivolous request for eos or cos is denied for  cause, unlawful presence begins to accrue the day after the request is  denied.   and 9 fam 302.11-3 b  1  b  4  b  ii :    b. dhs has interpreted  period of stay authorized by the secretary of  homeland security,  as used in this context, to include:     4  for aliens who have applied for extension of stay or change of  nonimmigrant classification and who have remained in the united states  after expiration of the from i-94 while awaiting dhs is decision, the  entire period of the pendency of the application, provided that:      a  the alien does not work unlawfully while the application is  pending and did not work unlawfully prior to filing the application   and     b  the alien did not otherwise fail to maintain his or her status  prior to the filing of the application  unless the application is  approved at the discretion of uscis and the failure to maintain status  is solely a result of the expiration of the form i-94 , and further  provided either:     i   ...   or     ii  if the application was denied or the alien departed while the  application was still pending, that the application was timely filed  and nonfrivolous.    unlawful presence  does not cause a ban unless she leaves the us after accrues more than 180 days of  unlawful presence . so she should not have to worry about a ban as long as she leaves within a reasonable amount of time after she learns about the denial.  the other consequence of her being still in the us when her extension of status is denied if her i-94 is expired, is that ina 222 g  is triggered, which means the visa she used to enter the us is automatically voided, and she would have to apply for us visas from her country of nationality from then on.  also, uscis has a policy where they will issue notices to appear  ntas  to people after an i-539 denial if they are unlawfully present after the denial, although i am not sure whether they are still doing that during the covid-19 outbreak. according to this teleconference, they will wait for a 33-day period  the period to file a motion to reopen or reconsider  after the denial before they issue the nta, so this basically means your mother should try to leave within 33 days of a denial.  on the other hand, if she leaves the us while her timely-filed, non-frivolous extension of status application is still pending  i.e. before it is approved or denied , she does not accrue any  unlawful presence , and her visa is not voided.  see afm chapter 40.9.2 b  3  c :    departure from the united states while a request for eos or cos is  pending, does not subject an alien to the 3-year, 10-year, or  permanent bar, if he or she departs after the expiration of form i-94,  arrival/departure record unless the application was frivolous,  untimely, or the individual had worked without authorization.   and the 9 fam 302.11-3 b  1  b  4  b  ii  passage quoted previously.  and it does not void her visa under ina 222 g , according to 9 fam 302.1-9 b  1  c  4  b :     ...  in addition, if an alien departs after the date on the form i-94  passes, but before his or her application for extension or change of  status has been decided by uscis, they must be subject to a blanket  exemption from ina 222 g , if the application was filed in a  timely  manner  and is  nonfrivolous  in nature. you may consider an  application nonfrivolous if it is not, on its face, a groundless  excuse for the applicant to remain in the united states to engage in  activities incompatible with his or her status. posts may be  satisfied that an alien filed in a timely manner using evidence such  as a record in uscis person centric query service  pcqs  or the dated  receipt or canceled check from uscis for the payment of the  application fee to extend or change status together with evidence of  the expiration of the alien is legal status.   the meaning of being timely-filed and non-frivolous are described in afm chapter 40.9.2 b  3  c :     ...     the requirement that the application was timely may be established  through the submission of evidence of the date the previously  authorized stay expired, together with a copy of a dated filing  receipt, a canceled check payable to uscis for the eos or cos  application, or other credible evidence of a timely filing.     ...     to be considered non-frivolous, the application must have an arguable  basis in law and fact, and must not have been filed for an improper  purpose  such as to prolong one is stay to pursue activities  inconsistent with one is status .    in determining whether an eos or cos application was non-frivolous,  dos has instructed consular posts that it is not necessary to make a  determination that uscis would have ultimately ruled in favor of the  alien.   and 9 fam 302.11-3 b  5  b-c :    b.  ...  therefore, for all cases involving potential inadmissibility  under ina 212 a  9  b  whether under the three-year bar of  212 a  9  b  i  i  or the 10-year bar of ina 212 a  9  b  i  ii , dhs  has decided to consider all time during which an application for  extension of stay  eos  or change of nonimmigrant status  cos  is  pending to be a period of stay authorized by the secretary of homeland  security provided:     1  the application was filed in a timely manner  i.e., before the  expiration date of the form i-94, arrival and departure record      2  the application was  nonfrivolous   and     3  the alien has not engaged in unauthorized employment  whether  before or after april 1, 1997 .     ...     c. to be considered  nonfrivolous  the consular officer must find that  the application had an arguable basis in law and fact and must not  have been filed for an improper purpose  e.g., as a groundless excuse  for the applicant to remain in activities incompatible with his or her  status . it is not necessary to determine that the dhs would have  approved the application for it to be considered nonfrivolous.   so the question is whether her application of extension of status is  frivolous  or not. note that it is possible for an application to be  non-frivolous  even if uscis is likely to deny it  it just needs to have an  arguable basis in law and fact  and not be  filed for an improper purpose .  in my  non-professional  opinion, an application of extension of status for the reason of not being able to return to her home country to due covid-19 flight bans is not frivolous. in the uscis page on special situations, it mentions that for applications of extension of status and change of status, uscis will take into consideration how special situations prevented your departure.

Is there anything I should not do?,"the following measures are not effective against covid-2019 and can be harmful:  smoking,  wearing multiple masks, taking antibiotics.  in any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.",106
"I have heard several conspiracy theories regarding the origin of the new coronavirus, 2019-nCov. For example that the virus and/or SARS were produced in a laboratory or were some variant of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), shipped via laboratory workers. 

I am well aware bioinformatics has debunked many conspiracy theories involving infectious diseases, an important one being polio vaccination programs in Africa were the origin of HIV, for example here. Likewise, numerous conspiracy theories on the man-made origins of HIV were similarly overturned using bioinformatic studies.

Do you have bioinformatics evidence that would debunk the current conspiracists about coronaviruses?
","the scenarios are impossible and would be laughable if they were not so serious. the evidence is in the phylogenetic trees. its a bit like a crime scene when the forensics team investigate. we have done enough crime-scenes often going to the site, collecting the pathogen, sequencing and then analysis -  usually neglected diseases  without any associated conspiracy theories.   the key technical issue is coronaviruses are zoonoses , pathogens spread to humans from animal reservoirs and phylogenetic tree really helps understand the how the virus is transmitted.  trees    the key thing about all the trees are bats. bats lineages are present at every single point of the betacoronavirus phylogeny  tree , both as paraphyletic and monophyletic lineages, one example is this tree of betacoronaviruses here. meaning the nodes connecting the branches of the tree to the  master-branch , represent common ancestors and these were almost certainly bat-borne cornaviruses. this is especially true for sars and - here bat-viruses are everywhere.  the tree here also shows that sars arose on independently on two occassions, again surrounded by bat lineages and 2019-ncov has emerged separately at least once, again associated with bats.  finally the tree below is a figure from biorxiv zhou et al  2020   discovery of a novel coronavirus associated with the recent pneumonia outbreak in humans and its potential bat origin  shows the 2019-ncov lineage is a direct descendent of a very closely virus isolated from a bat  ratg13  . this is a really conclusive finding btw.    note, i do not normally present inline images, but it is such a nice finding  hint to reviewers  and biorxiv is open access.  conspiracy theory 1: laboratory made virus  literally it would require someone passaging a new virus, with unknown human pathogenicity, and independently introducing all the earlier passages enmass across bat populations of china. they would then hope each lineage becomes an indepedent virus population before, then introducing the virus to humans. thus when field teams of scientists go around using mist nets to trap the bats, buy them from markets, isolate the virus and sequence it they would find a beautiful, array of natural variation in the bat populations leading up to the human epidemics, that perfectly matches vast numbers of other viral zoonoses. moreover, this would have to have happen substancially prior to sars and 2019-ncov, because the bat betacoronaviruses have been known about prior both epidemics, viz. its simply not feasible.  biological explanation general bats are a reservoir host to vast numbers of pathogens, particularly viruses, including many alphaviruses, flaviviruses, rabies virus and beleived to be important in ebolavirus  i do not know about this  and even important to several eukaryotic parasites. it makes sense, they are mammals, so evolutionary much closer to us than birds for example, with large dispersal potential and roost in  overcrowded  areas enable rapid transmission between bats.  technical the trees show bats are the common ancestor of betacoronaviruses in particular for the lineage leading into the emergence of 2019-ncov and sars, this is seen in this tree, this one and the tree above. the obvious explanation is the virus circulates endemically in bats and has jumped into humans. for sars the intermediate host, or possible  vector  was civet cats.   the theory and the observations fit into a seamless biological answer.  conspiracy theory 2: middle eastern connection  i heard a very weird conspiracy theory attempting to connect mers with 2019-ncov. the theory was elaborate and i do not think it is productive to describe here.  biological explanation all the trees of betacoronaviruses show mers was one of the earliest viruses to diverge and is very distant from 2019-ncov, to the extent the theory is completely implausible. the homology between these viruses is 50 , so its either mers or 2019-ncov. its more extreme than mixing up yellow fever virus  mortality 40-80   with west nile virus  mortality  lt  lt 0.1  , the two viruses are completely different at every level.  what about errors  phylogeneticists can spot it a mile off. there are tell-tale phylogenetic signatures we pick up, but also we do this to assess  rare  genetic phenomina. there is nothing  rare  about the coronaviruses. the only anomaly is variation in the poly-a tail and that is the natural variation from in vitro time-series experiments. basically we have looked at enough virses/parasites through trees, that have no conspiracy theories at all  often neglected diseases , and understand how natural variation operates - so a phylogenecist can shift the wheat from the chaff without really thinking about it.  opinion the conspiracy theories are deeply misplaced, and the only connection i can imagine is its china. however, the chinese have loads of viruses, influenza in particular which causes major pandemics, but that is a consequence of their natural ecology  small-holder farming  allowing the virus to move between reservoir hosts. i have not visited small-hold farms in china, but i have in other parts of the world and when you see them, you get it. the pigs, chickens  ducks .. china , dogs, horses and humans all living within 10 meters of each other.   conclusion shipping large numbers of bats to market, bat soup, raw meat from arboreal  tree-living  mammals such as civets that are sympatric to bats. then consider the classical epidemiology in light of the phylogenetic data, which is very consistent, a single picture emerges that coronavirus is one of many zoonoses which has managed to transmit between patients.   summary the fundamental point is the bioinformatics fit into the classical epidemiology of a zoonose.   , note the bat coronavirus ratg13 predates the 2019-ncov outbreak by 7 years. it is not even clear whether the virus has been isolated, i.e. could just be a rna sequence.   they have found some 500 novel coronaviruses, about 50 of which fall relatively close to the sars virus on the family tree, including ratg13--it was fished out of a bat fecal sample they collected in 2013 from a cave in moglang in yunnan province.   cohen,  mining coronavirus genomes for clues to the outbreak is origins  feb, 2020 science magazine, ",141
Can antiretrovirals be used to prevent COVID-19 infection?,"two studies have reported the use of lpv/r as post-exposure prophylaxis for sars-cov and mers-cov. one of these studies suggested that the occurrence of mers-cov infection was lower among health workers receiving lpv/r compared to those who did not receive any drugs  the other study found no cases of sars-cov infection among 19 people living with hiv hospitalized in the same ward of sars patients, of whom 11 were on antiretroviral therapy. again, the certainty of the evidence is very low due to small sample size, variability in drugs provided, and uncertainty regarding intensity of exposure.",8

"There's a higher likelihood everyday that I am considering pursuing a PhD in my field, and ultimately, in applying for positions as a professor down the road. What I am trying to do is think ahead as to what some extra pieces of my application could include that are not research related. I understand that every field is different, but there are most likely numerous qualities and characteristics on an academic application that are not bound by discipline. So the question I would like to figure out is what type of professional development activities I can work on over the course of my PhD that would contribute to a well-rounded academic resume. 

Obviously, publications are key components in an application and over time those will (hopefully) manifest as research continues. What I am trying to do now is target other areas that will allow me to round out an application in the future. As an example, I am currently taking a Teaching &amp; Learning Program with the Graduate Studies department at my university and the program draws on the ""Science of Teaching and Learning"". In contrast to research papers, this type of thing may be minor, but I feel that developing these sort of auxiliary components to the overall application over time are all important. 

So pursuing development to become a better educator (and this is because I actually want to, not because I feel compelled to) is one thing that I can do in the present to help prepare me for the future. I am wondering what some other things can be done over time (especially over the course of a PhD), that can contribute to a strong application aside from research activities. Below is a list of some things that I have thought of that could be developed over the course of a PhD that could A) help a future application or at least B) make my life easier down the road (haha).

I debated asking this question, because it sort of feels like a shopping question, although after some thought it felt like more of a professional development question. 
","actually the most important thing for you to focus on right now is getting a good research experience and a good relationship with an advisor. get started on that. learn to go deep into some subfield of your overall field. gain expertise in that.   along the way, if you want to be an academic, a bit of teaching experience will help, but will be more valuable for some positions than others. but without the  gain expertise  part it will not matter much.   and i caution against trying to choose a field strategically based on what is going on this month. you will graduate, in several years, into a completely different job situation and it is impossible to predict how it will go long in advance. as you get closer to graduation, in four years or so in the us, you can start to broaden your skill set depending on the perceived needs at that time.   but some things are valuable in any case. learning to do research. learning to write. learning to collaborate. building a circle of potential collaborators.  but most of the details you suggest are just distractions at this time. day 1 is the day you look seriously for the best advisor willing to work with you.

"How would you explain COVID-19 lockdown to a 4 year old given that the lockdown might be in place for months in London?
","first of all, recognize that your concerns may not be the same as your four year old is concerns. this has two implications:   your child may be worried about things you could not have thought of. your child is likely shielded from or does not understand a lot of what is going on, and that can also mean that they do not have access to bits of information that would actually be reassuring. encourage your child to ask questions about corona, so that they are not left to ponder on their own things that may seem frightening. you are likely worrying about outcomes your child has no thought of. try not to pass on your own fears to your child. if pre-school is closed and one parent has to stay home from work to care for the child, recognize that this may be viewed as a mainly positive outcome to the child.   with my three year old, i emphasize that all closures and restrictions  writing from sweden, we are not currently in full lockdown  are not - ultimately - to protect us from disease, but to protect our elderly from catching it from us. i find that framing to be appealing because it is both true, and i imagine it is less scary to a young child to hear how we all have to chip in and make sacrifices to protect another group, than to convey an image that it is actually unsafe for them to step outside.  why we should wash our hands and what is so good about vaccines are some things we talk about normally, and the current situation is a good opportunity to put that into context. you can say that it is to avoid this that we vaccinate against a lot of other things, and that scientists are working on a vaccine against this too. that perhaps once your kid will have children of their own, and they will receive a corona vaccine as well in the routine program, and your child will be able to tell their children how they remember what it was like before the vaccine. washing hands has been a constant battle. now we have introduced a longer routine, which involves singing a 20-second-long song, and compliance has  temporarily, i assume  increased.  consider whether you are changing your own behavior in a manner which may require explanation. for instance, if you are suddenly buying groceries in conspicuously larger quantities than normal, or even if they may have seen the images of empty shelves, you may want to point out that you and others are trying to reduce your number of trips to the grocery store, and hence the number of chances you may infect some at-risk person, lest they think that you are actually going to run out of food.  as an adult, it is easy to become consumed by this. we like to stay updated about what is going on in the world, and this is certainly a main event, and a rapidly evolving one. for my own sake, i could easily bingewatch news for the greater part of the day, and spend the remainder hypothesizing over different future scenarios. recognize that a young child is world is smaller than yours. talk about it as a thing that is happening right now, but make sure most of your interactions revolve around normal day to day activities. the above is addressing your question, how to talk about corona, but also make sure you do not talk exclusively about corona.

"Multiple groups of scientists are trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine but they are not yet being fruitful. What challenges or difficulties are there in the process that slowing down and/or causing failure in development of vaccine?
","there are multiple challenges presented, and many of those are not limited to coronavirus vaccine.  as mentioned above, it just takes time. before a vaccine can be used in patients, clinical trials must be performed to validate the safety and efficiency of the vaccine candidate. a clinical trial includes three phases, which again, just takes time.  but to really answer your question, what are some challenges of developing a vaccine   to begin with, from the perspective of lab research, we first need to develop a vaccine candidate. what protein on the virus should we take as an antigen  there are many many proteins on the virus, and for cov, we know it is a protein called spike protein. it is the neutralizing target on the virus. which means, when an antibody bound to this site, it could prevent the virus from infecting the cells. okay, then we have to know, do we need to do something to this protein to make a vaccine  for example, when we try to manufacture this protein into a vaccine, what if the protein is degraded  or it somehow becomes a  bad  protein that simply cannot stimulate immune responses in human  these are just some examples of roadblocks of developing vaccine.  let is suppose we finally work those out. then what is next  each candidate vaccine needs to be tested in animals before going into human clinical trial. this step is time-consuming.  now we are finally ready to start clinical trials. according to fda, the vaccine for human trials  also for each drug  needs to be produced under good manufacturing practices  gmp . it is basically a standard operating procedure to make sure that the vaccine candidate can be manufactured in a large-scale, quality-controlled manner. there are many many challenges, like how to purify the protein  how to scale-up production. this is partly of the reason why the first vaccine in trial in usa is an mrna, and in china is a dna, both of which does not require complicated protein purification.  as you can see, the list of challenges can go on and on. but there are scientists and doctors working diligently on it. hopefully we will get there.

I don't want to really just go to China, if I can claim my flights and hotels in China back I'd rather postpone the whole trip, plus I'd have to get extra hotels and activities planned for the time I would have been in North Korea.

"It's been reported recently that people are panic-buying stuff as the coronavirus epidemic worsens. I've even noticed that the local grocery store is low on hand sanitizer, paper towels, and bottled water.

Most of that makes sense to me. The exception is the supply of water. We have public water systems that send drinkable water to us, so why do we need to prepare a stash?

","there are few different things to consider:   deductible : since you have an hsa you are probably on a high deductible insurance plan. take a look at your hsa balance and divide by your max out of pocket deductible. that is the number of years you are covered for the  worst case  scenario. i would say you want at least ten, but 100 years would be excessive. depends of course on you own risk comfort. retirement : health care cost will likely be the single largest expense in retirement and unfortunately it is the hardest to predict and find good data on. a recent fidelity study put the average life time out-of-pocket cost for a couple into the  300.000 range. other studies quote about  5000- 7000 in today is dollar per year per person on medicare. health care inflation is currently significantly higher than regular inflation, which complicates the math further. still, it is not unreasonable to have several hundred thousand dollars squirreled away for retirement health care coronavirus and shifts in the health care system: this is pure speculation at this point, but chances are that the current crisis will have an impact on the way health care works and gets paid for in the future. the most drastic change would be a single payer system  as many other countries in the civilized world already have  but it is very hard to predict how an hsa would roll over into this. one of the more plausible scenarios would be to allow a roll over into an ira but that is all a wild guess at the moment.  in any case the current system is stretched thin already. the average retiree spends more than 40  of their social security income on health care and it is getting worse quickly. investment: hsa contributions are pre-tax money. in most cases that alone will outweigh any potential investment return. assuming there is no high interest debt, i would recommend to first max out pre-tax retirement contributions, then pre-tax college savings and then pre-tax hsa. if you have other highly attractive investment vehicle you can consider those too. stocks are cheap at the moment, although very risky and likely to be volatile for a while.   looking at the actual medical risk is probably not that helpful. statistics do not really help if it is just you and your family. would you be doing anything differently if you knew the risk for a major health disaster is 0.1  instead of 0.2     ",48

"On Friday, Russia declined to participate in a plan devised by the Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut oil production levels, in order to keep oil prices steady in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The article describes this refusal as the cause of the 10% oil price crash on Friday alone, which was exacerbated by a further 30% crash on Monday.

What reasons has Russia given for their refusal to participate in the OPEC group's plan?
","disclaimer: i am no expert, this answer is based on my modest understanding of the situation at play.  the opec decision to cut oil production was meant to keep prices high: if every opec country were selling all the oil they could, it would drive prices down since there would be more supply than demand. so if every opec country agrees to sell only a limited amount of oil, the global supply matches the global demand and prices stay high. naturally this works only if all the big oil producing countries play the game: it is tempting for a country to sell more than its agreed quota, especially if the price is high.  russia is not an official member of opec, only an observer. as such, it is free to follow opec policies or not, depending on its own interests and strategy. i am not aware of any official reason why russia refused to follow this particular recent decision, but it looks like a rational economic decision: if many oil producers  competitors  reduce their supply and the prices are high, why would russia limit their own supply if they have no obligation to     this refusal is cited as the cause of the 10  oil price crash on friday alone, which was exacerbated by a further 30  crash on monday.   this is not the full explanation: the russian refusal led saudi arabia to cancel the original plan to reduce production  guardian , and instead to flood the market with their own oil. this is what drove prices down sharply, especially in the current context of low demand due to the corona virus.  the saudi surprise strategy could arguably be interpreted as a kind of tactical response against russia is refusal to play according to opec rules: since russia apparently wants to reap the benefits of high prices without sacrificing their own production, saudi arabia is telling them that  two can play this game . the effect is that all the oil producing countries are going to suffer from low prices, but some more than others:    the new strategy adopted by riyadh appears to target russia and us shale oil firms, many of which are known to have high production costs and lose money when crude prices fall below  50 a barrel for more than a few months.   saudi arabia can produce oil at a lower cost than russia and us shale oil industry, so they are probably trying to use the opportunity of the russian refusal to get rid of some competitors: saudi arabia can afford to take a temporary economic hit, whereas many shale oil companies may go bankrupt quickly. strategically, their initiative is certainly also meant to assert their dominance on the oil market.     added: a similar analysis by kevin drum, found just after posting my answer     the nickel version of this story is that oil prices started declining in february due to fears of lower demand caused by the coronavirus outbreak. opec tried to cut a deal with russia to reduce output all around, but russia balked. saudi arabia then decided to bring out its big guns, lowering prices immediately by about  7 per barrel and announcing that it would increase output in order to take share away from russia. at that point the decline turned into a rout, with the price of wti crude collapsing to  28 as i write this.

"We planned a 3-week trip to Japan in March, but because of the recent increase in infections over there, we started to wonder if it wouldn't be smarter to cancel.

This is our travel plan:


06-03-2020: Munich -> London -> Tokyo
27-03-2020: Tokyo -> London -> Munich


We are mainly worried about two possibilities:


The airports shutting down, preventing us from getting back (my boss wouldn't be too happy).
Ending up in quarantine because we have an infected person on the plane.


While there, we planned on staying mainly in the countryside anyways, so the risk of getting infected ourselves is rather low in my opinion.
","this question is likely to get closed as opinion-based, but a few reference points:   unless things get positively apocalyptic, it is exceedingly unlikely that japan is airports would shut down completely. flights might be reduced, but as a comparison point, airports in china -- even in wuhan -- have kept operating throughout the crisis there. on the inbound flight, this would require an infected person coming from munich or london, which is statistically improbable. on the way back, this is a higher possibility, but still unlikely unless  again  there is a major outbreak.   fwiw, i was in tokyo last week, and while it is not exactly panic in the air, people are definitely taking precautions: temperature scans at the airport, more masks than usual, hand washing  amp  sanitizers, large gatherings cancelled, etc . this in itself seems likely to limit the spread of the virus, making full-blown contagion less likely. but at the end of the day it is your call.

"Why do coronaviruses come from bats?

I mean, why precisely coronaviruses and not (for instance) herpesviruses?
It looks like bats host more zoonotic viruses (per species) than rodents, although they don't develop any sign of disease.

The article above says that rodents host more zoonotic viruses than bats overall (68 against 61), but at the same time most of the latest pandemics originated from bats.

It also seems that bats could be involved in the maintenance of ebola viruses.

My question is: why did these major pandemics originate from bats and not from rodents, although rodents host more zoonotic viruses overall?

We should also take into consideration that human-rodent interaction is usually more likely than human-bat interaction, except for people who consume bats (like Chinese people; this would (partially) explain why both SARS and 2019-nCoV developed in China).

"Central Banks around the world have cut interest rates in the past few days in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the US Federal Reserve (0-0.25%), the Bank of England (0.1%), and the Reserve Bank of Australia (0.25%). Notably, the European Central Bank has not yet cut interest rates further, but this is partly because it is already in the negatives, at -0.5%.

Why are central banks taking this measure in response to this pandemic in particular - i.e. how does this measure lessen the pandemic's economic impact - and what are the impacts on the average consumer of a cut in their country's central bank interest rate in general?
","by lowering interest rates the fed is main goal is to prop up the stock market, and support us corporations.  this is achieved through the following effects: - it encourages credit creation through bank lending, and because most money originates in credit it makes money cheaper and more widely available - it lowers the rates of return on savings and thus encourages savers to spend more freely, which has a twofold effect: it stimulates the economy into the creation of yet more loans, and it tells savers to go elsewhere with their money  the resulting availability of money/credit and lowered bank savings rates makes the stock market an attractive destination.  since 2007, the financial crisis, the fed is essentially a hostage of the stock market in that if now must keep loose monetary policy to further the illusion of perpetual long term stock market gains. this is further evidenced by the tentative and then aborted qt  quantitive tightening  attempt last year.   in the current climate of coronavirus economic meltdown, the lowered interest rate has a further goal: to help protect us corporations who are now overstretched on corporate bonds.  since 2007, unbeknownst to many, and i think illegal outside the us     , corporations - rather than restructure in the wake of the crisis - regularly take advantage of the cheap money stimulus by issuing corporate bonds  essentially borrowing money at low rates  so that their execs can use this to direct the company to purchase its own stock on the stock market. this creates the illusion of rising corporate value while allowing shareholders to receive big dividends and ceos to pay themselves income related bonuses.  this irresponsible corporate behaviour has brought us corporations to the point that the coronavirus meltdown has slowed earnings below what they need to pay on the corporate bonds. without direct government support many us corporations will go bust, and corporate bond prices will plummet, which will trigger further meltdown in financial institutions that invest in those assets.  again, silently under the media radar, just this week the us     and ecb created new funds that will be directed to supply money to those institutions buying corporate bonds. to be clear, the way that works is that bondholders who are now nervous about the corporation defaulting might not roll over their bond....rather than reacquiring bonds at the end of their term, or even ending prematurely, they will demand their money from the corps. the corps. do not have it, but new bonds will be sold to the govt backed funds.  once again the taxpayer bails out the fatcat   so in summary, the reduced interest rate in combo with new funds, is designed to prop up the stock market and corporations to prevent socioeconomic collapse.  around the world, central banks lower the rate for the effects of stimulus and stock market prop-up described above. ecb does not lower because the negative interest rate actually makes loans more expensive in some cases as being paid to borrow makes it easier than to lend.
