" What is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from the coronavirus? How safe is it to use alcohol-based hand sanitizer to disinfect surfaces and objects that may be in contact with people who are sick with or have recently died?  Or is there a vaccine or treatment that can prevent the virus from spreading to others? What are the health and safety concerns about handwashing and other hand hygiene products, including hand rubs, that are commonly used in hospitals and emergency rooms, and which may pose a risk to people with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection? Are there any specific guidelines or guidelines for how people should clean and disinfect objects and surfaces in public and private settings, such as public restrooms and public health facilities? If so, what are some of the concerns and benefits of using hand-washing products in settings where the risk of transmission is highest? Do hand washing products pose any health risk, or should they be avoided and used only in areas with high transmission rates? Is there an effective and safe method for people to safely wash their hands with soap and water? Any recommendations on how to best protect themselves and others against the potentially serious health risks associated with handhandwashing, especially those with recent death or serious illness, should be based on current evidence and the evidence available at the time of death, rather than on a particular manufacturer or product? I am interested in hearing from anyone who has experienced or is currently experiencing health concerns related to handswashing.  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the CDC’s Office of Global Public Health at 202-647-4000 or visit https://www.cdc.gov/guidance/publichealth/about-health-distancing-for-the-1st-order-of-flu-symptoms-and-how-to-help-protect-yourself/advice.html  For more information, visit: http://who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronaviruses/2019-ncov/summary.cfm?CDC_COVID_Covid_19_summary&amp;id=2020-03-30
For additional information about the risks of contact between people living with, for example, HIV or other sexually transmitted infections, contact your health care provider. CDC recommends that people stay 6 feet away from others and that they wear a cloth face covering when walking or running, cover their coughs and sneezes with a tissue or tissue and dispose of any personal items they may have picked up on the road or in a public place.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" If you have questions about eligibility for unemployment, you should contact your state or local unemployment agency. You can find more information about unemployment eligibility here.

If you are looking for work-study options, there are a number of options available. Here are some of the most popular:


Find a job.  Many states and localities have offered job openings to people looking to start a new job in the coming weeks or months. Some companies are offering full-time positions, but many of these positions are temporary and can be filled by workers who have already been laid off or have been placed back on the job market. Employers are also offering paid sick leave and paid family leave, as well as paid leave to employees who are out of work due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Many state, local, and tribal governments have set aside money to help pay for essential needs, such as food stamps and unemployment insurance, for people who need them most. But many states have closed or suspended their unemployment programs, so you may be able to find work through your local job training program, which requires you to submit an application online and provide proof of income, including Social Security numbers, driver's license, health insurance number, medical certificate, child care card, or a government-issued ID card. For information on how to file your own tax return, see How can I file my own return?. If your child’s school or college graduation is delayed or canceled, the government may provide financial assistance, though it is not guaranteed that it will be sufficient to cover the costs of paying for college and graduate school expenses. In some states, schools and universities have canceled or reduced classes, leaving students with little or no income to rely on for their education. To find out if you qualify for help with your taxes, call your [state or county](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/help-with-your- taxes) or call the [State and County] Office of Emergency Services at 1-800-662-4000. The [Federal Emergency Economic Stabilization and Unemployment Insurance (Jan. 1, 2020) Act allows states to extend unemployment benefits for up to six months, provided that: (1) the application is timely,
(2) there is no denial of benefits under section 505(a)(3)(B)(ii)(II), and (3) benefits are not suspended or terminated for a period of not less than one year after application was filed; and



  
  The application shall be in writing and shall contain the following information:  (A) The reason for the delay in processing your application; (B) A description of any changes to your status that have occurred in your employment status or that you intend to make in order to remain employed;
and (C) Any other information that the Secretary determines is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act and the regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor under the Federal Job Retention and Dispositional Assistance Act, to provide assistance to you in determining whether you need assistance in complying with the Act or regulations and in preparing for or attempting to obtain work authorization for your current or former employer. (You may also be entitled to a Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) payment if your unemployment is extended beyond the date of your last employment authorization and you were not claimed as a dependent on Form I-539 for at least 14 days prior to filing this application, whichever is later.)
You should also check to ensure that your employer has provided you with information regarding your eligibility and your ability to continue to work after your Extension of Job Security Extension (EJSE) application has been approved and has not been terminated. This information should be provided in a timely manner and be accompanied by a signed statement from the employer and any required documents and forms of identification required by USCIS to be present at the time of application rejection or termination, along with any other supporting documentation you provided during the 14-day period preceding your EIJSE application application filing date. It is important to note that this information may not be accurate and may contain inaccuracies or omissions in some instances, e.g., if an employee is denied an extension of employment because they have a medical condition that causes them to have difficulty in completing work, they may need to contact their employer to request that they be placed on leave or reassign to another position to support their health care needs. However, employers are encouraged to use the information they provide to their employees to assist them in making informed decisions regarding their work status and eligibility. See Information for Workers with Disabilities and Dependents of Certain Foreign Nationals and Aliens for additional guidance on this and other issues related to workers' access to information and assistance with their disabilities and dependents. For additional information, Employers and employers should refer to Federal Government Information for Families and Families with Dependent Children (FIDF"
" The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to be spread mainly through contact with respiratory droplets produced when someone coughs or sneezes. However, there is no known way to know if a person can contract the virus from a single person or is it spread through multiple people. WHO is working on developing a vaccine to prevent the spread of 2019-nCov, but this is still in its early stages. It is hoped that this vaccine will be available to all people living with HIV who have the disease and will help prevent further spread. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has also issued guidance to healthcare workers on how to protect themselves and their loved ones from the new virus, including the use of masks and hand hygiene.

" It’s hard to know exactly how long a virus can survive on a surface, but scientists say that it could be up to two weeks. 
 Scientists at the University of Rochester Medical Center in Rochester, New York, say they have found a way to make a vaccine that lasts longer on plastic and stainless steel than on cardboard.
“If you put a piece of plastic on it, it will stick to the surface for a long time,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Rochester College of Medicine. “So if you take it out of a plastic bag and put it in a container and let it air dry, you can see it sticking to surfaces for days. And then you have to start looking at it again and again to see if it has developed immunity to other coronaviruses that are on the market right now. So it is a very, very long-lasting vaccine, and we are very hopeful that we will be able to get it into human clinical trials in the next couple of months. We are also looking for other ways to extend the life of the vaccine.""
 The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to be spread primarily through respiratory droplets produced when someone coughs or sneezes. It can also be transmitted through contact with bodily fluids, such as saliva or mucus, which can cause symptoms similar to those caused by the common cold. But scientists are still trying to figure out if there are any biological mechanisms that could prevent or cure the disease.


So far, no vaccine has been developed to protect against the illness. However, there have been a number of studies that have shown that certain types of vaccines can be effective against certain viruses. For example, the flu shot was shown to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, while the hepatitis C vaccine had anti-HIV-1 antibody against MERS and the influenza vaccine against H1N1. The most recent study, published in JAMA Pediatrics on March 27, found that a combination of routine hand hygiene and routine use of hand sanitizer significantly reduced the risk of developing severe illness in infants born to mothers who had been exposed to at least one other person who tested positive for the viruses, compared with those who did not wear any personal protective equipment (PPE).

The CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering when handling small amounts of household items, like wipes and disinfecting surfaces with household disinfectants. People should also wash their hands frequently with soap and water after touching objects or surfaces, including surfaces that may be contaminated with virus.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" The COVID-19 pandemic has left millions of Americans without health insurance. How can insurance companies protect their workers and their loved ones from the virus that threatens to wipe out their livelihoods and devastate the economy if they don’t have insurance?


https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/health/coronavirus.html?_r=1&amp;ref=health-insurance-companies-protect-their-workers-and-family-from-the-virus-that-threatens-to- wipe-out-our-economy-if-they-do-not-have-an-emergency-response-in-us-or-a-state-of- emergency?srt=rss&gt;cid=2020-03-04%2Fnews-detail-article-covid19-pandemic-dispensing-company-guidance-for-surviving-without-any-conditions-such-as-air-conditioning, food-safety, or other essential-services?page=article#ixzz2hZWnRnfVhUyIwCnhbGEwIyMzR0NTQ&tag=corporate-healthcare-partnership&src=WP_news_detail_article_1)  
(The bottom line is that if you are covered by an insurance policy, you have the right to sue your employer for wrongful termination, and you should be able to get a $100,000 wrongful-death award.  If you lost your job because of your coverage, the government will probably have to pay you back at least a portion of that amount, which is a lot of money for a small business. But that's not the whole story, of course. The government can't just throw money at you and say, ""Go back to work and get your money back,"" and then demand that you pay back whatever you owe them. So the best way to protect yourself and your family from this is to have a plan in place that covers all your expenses, including your insurance premiums, deductibles, co-payments, car payments, medical bills, rent, utilities, child care, groceries, etc. You can find a list of state and local government agencies that are working on this, but they are not all in the same place, so it's best to go to a local agency and ask for help, rather than going to the state or local sheriff's office to find out if there are any local law enforcement agencies you can call to help with your case. If there aren't any, call your state attorney general and request that he or she designate a special prosecutor to look into your situation and make sure there is no abuse of office or corruption of justice that could put you in jail for life. This is especially important in states that have been hit hard by the outbreak, like New York and California, where the number of people who have died has doubled every year since the beginning of the epidemic. It is also important to remember that the federal government has the authority to take punitive actions against states and municipalities that fail to provide essential services to their citizens, even if the people in those states are in violation of federal law. For example, if a state government employee is found to be negligent in its response to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts, they could face up to 10 years in prison and a hefty fine, though that is not a punishment that can be used to punish a person for not doing their part in helping to prop up the flood-ravaged state. In general, it is better to stay home and do your own research before making a decision to leave your home, especially if your loved one is in need of urgent care or is being cared for by a health care provider who is willing to treat you like any other human being, whether that be a paramedic, an emergency room physician, a mental health provider, someone with a proven history of mental illness or a family member who has been in close contact with the person who needs to care for the sick person, to ensure that they do not end up in isolation or in an institution where they may be at higher risk for severe illness and/or for other serious health conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, heart failure, lung disease or lung cancer. Be sure to self-isolate, wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth, cover your cough and sneeze with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or hand rub and maintain a distance of 1 meter (3 feet) from others who are coughing, sneezing or touching you."
" Can I get tested for COVID-19 if I am over the age of 60 and have not been exposed to the virus for more than 14 days? If so, how long does the incubation period between exposure to and testing positive mean, and is there any way to know for certain if this is still a risk for me to be tested?
I have been in contact with a number of people who have tested positive, but none of them have ever been tested. What are the chances of me being tested at any stage of my life, given the current coronavirus pandemic and the fact that I do not yet have a fever, sore throat, or other symptoms? Do I need to take any special precautions to protect myself and my family from getting tested, as well as the risk of getting infected from others who are also infected? I think it is important to share information about the risks and benefits of being over 60, especially for those with underlying medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer or cancer of the lung, heart, lung or kidney. This information should be shared with anyone who is considering seeking medical care, including family members, friends and colleagues, to help them make informed decisions about their health and well-being. Please share this information with your healthcare provider and other healthcare professionals as soon as possible so they can make sure they are aware of any changes to their routine and ensure they follow the recommendations of their local and state health authorities.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" What is the current status of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States and how can I protect myself and my family against the virus? 
The CDC has advised against travel to, or contact with, people with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. CDC recommends that all Americans, regardless of their travel history, stay 6 feet away from anyone who has recently traveled to a U.S. hospital or other public health facility, including healthcare workers, family members, and others who are caring for the sick person. Travel restrictions and restrictions on interstate travel are in place to help protect Americans from the new virus, but there is no evidence to suggest that any of these restrictions have been effective in preventing or slowing the spread of this new, deadly virus. For more information, see CDC’s Guidance for Travel Restrictions and Other Policies for Americans Living with HIV and Those Who Have Recently Expanded Their HIV Status. For information about how your state and local governments can protect themselves and their loved ones from this newly discovered disease, State and Local Governments Can Protect Your Health and Safety by” Preparing for and Ensuring the Safety and Health of Your Community.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" Yes, you can. 

For example, if you are planning to travel to the US and want to stay up to date with your loved ones, the best course of action is to contact your local embassy, consulate or consular post and arrange a stay in a hotel or hostel. However, it is important to note that hotels and hostels are not the only places where you may be able to get a date booked, as there are also places such as cinemas, pubs, restaurants, bars, clubs, theatres and sports stadiums. You should also check that your travel documents are in good standing and that they are valid for at least 14 months, and have been issued by the relevant government authority. For more information on this, see How do I get my documents in order to enter the Schengen Area? and What is the status of my current visa?
You can apply for a new visa at any embassy or consulate in your country of nationality within 14 days of your entry, provided that you have not been previously refused entry.
However, there is no guarantee that the visa will be valid in all cases, so you should check to see if the embassy has issued a travel advisory for you, or if it has sent you a notice that it will not be issuing a visa until after the 14-day period has elapsed. The embassy will advise you on your rights and restrictions during this period, including the possibility of re-admitting you to your home country. If you do not wish to continue your trip to a country with a different visa policy than the one you were in before the travel ban was imposed, your application should be considered non-frivolous and be treated as such, rather than a genuine attempt to circumvent the ban. It is therefore possible to have your visa cancelled without prejudice, but this is likely to be difficult and expensive, especially for people who have already applied for permanent residency in the country where your stay will take place. To find out more about how the process is different in some countries, visas can be found on the official website of the European Commission or can be downloaded from the European Centre for the Study of Visa Policies and Procedures on the Commission’s website. In addition, a list of countries that have issued travel advisories for travellers arriving from outside Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic is available on the Commission's external website and on its official social media channels.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" There are a number of things you can do to reduce your risk of getting sick. First and foremost among these is to:
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with soap and water, especially after using the bathroom, before, during, and after work and school. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Avoid touching your face, nose or mouth with your bent elbow or tissue and cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you are not in contact with people who are ill. If you develop fever or other respiratory symptoms and are coughing or sneezing into your hand, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (e.g., Ethyl alcohol, Sodium hypochlorite) or a hand rub or washable cloth to disinfect the surface of the contaminated hand before you leave the house. Follow the directions of your local health authority and local public health authorities on how to safely dispose of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other household items, such as masks and gloves, in accordance with the Public Health Agency of Canada’s guidance on disposing of PPE and related items (https://www.canada.ca/publichealth/health-advice/pca-guidance-on-handwashing-for-persons-with-pneumonia-and-contaminated- surfaces-in-council-of-countries/article_briefing-detail.cfm?CDC_PPE_ID=COVID_19_Guid%3A%2Femergencies_in_Canada&amp;Cases_Infected_by_country) to protect yourself and others from the virus.

" Yes, but only if you’re able to pay the fare. 

If you have a medical condition, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer or cancer of the lung, you can still get a refund. But you should check with your insurance company to see if they have policies that cover the cost of cancelling a flight. Some states, like New York and California, have passed laws that allow people to recover money from their insurance companies after a plane has been forced off the road, and some airlines have even offered to refund passengers who have lost money on flights that have been rescheduled. However, that money can only be used for the costs incurred by the airline that issued the ticket, not the actual costs of flying the flight — and that's especially true for people with pre-existing medical conditions like preexisting lung conditions or a chronic condition like diabetes or heart conditions. For more information about how your money is managed and spent, see How much money are you eligible to receive from your health insurance?
Learn more about your rights and responsibilities under the law and how to get help for yourself and your loved ones after you've been to a disaster or disaster site. Learn about the laws surrounding emergency relief and disaster relief relief programs, including the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance for People Living with HIV (DOHIP) Act and the Supplemental Security Income Security Program (SSI).   If you live in the United States and are not covered by your state or local insurance, there are some state and local programs that can help you with things like finding a job, paying your mortgage, getting a child care loan, or getting medical care. You can find information on how these programs work at the state, local, tribal and territorial level, as well as on the Department of Health and Human Services website, which has guidance on eligibility and eligibility for help with questions about eligibility, eligibility requirements, payment amounts and other important information.

" The current coronavirus pandemic has infected more people than the entire world combined, according to the World Health Organization.

The WHO says that the number of people who have died from COVID-19 in the United States is estimated at more than 1.5 billion. That's a death rate of about 1 in every 1,000 people, or about 0.2 per cent of the world's population. The WHO estimates the mortality rate for the disease at about 3.6 per 100, 100 and 200 people respectively, depending on age, health conditions, geographic location and other factors, and it’s not known how many of those people will develop severe illness.


So far, the WHO has not published a complete list of affected countries, but it does include countries that have been hit hard by the outbreak, such as Iran, Sierra Leone, Nepal, South Korea, China and the Philippines. It also includes countries with relatively mild disease outbreaks like the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which has killed between 1 and 2 million people and caused about $700 billion in economic and social damage, as well as the deaths of hundreds of thousands of other people in China, India, Iran and Nepal.  
 But WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the organization is still assessing the situation and will update as more information becomes available. He did not elaborate on the specific countries affected, other than to say that it is ""very likely"" that at least some of these countries will experience some degree of economic or social disruption, including the loss of essential services like healthcare, schools, healthcare facilities and public health services. WHO is also working with local partners to develop a plan for how to best protect people living with HIV and those who may be at higher risk for severe disease, like those with underlying medical conditions or people with preexisting conditions.

" Yes, you can have multiple symptoms at the same time. 

For example, if you are coughing and sneezing, your body recognizes the cough as a sign of illness and will try to treat it as soon as possible. If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, the next time you feel unwell, seek medical attention and call in advance to arrange a time and place for yourself to be isolated and cared for. This is especially important for people who are immunocompromised and who may be at higher risk for severe illness, such as those with underlying medical conditions or those who have been in close contact with people with the disease. For people living with HIV, for whom self-isolation is a possibility, isolation can be an effective way to protect them and their loved ones from further spread of the virus. However, it is important to remember that isolation does not necessarily mean that you will be quarantined or placed in isolation, as some people do develop symptoms and require further treatment. In general, people should continue to practice good respiratory hygiene and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people they are close to, including their pets and other close family members.

" No. There is no evidence to support transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) through contact with human feces or bodily fluids. However, the virus can be transmitted through respiratory droplets produced when a person coughs or sneezes. Therefore, it is important to wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after touching a surface or object that may be contaminated with the new virus. For more information on cleaning and disinfection of surfaces and objects, see How to disinfect and protect yourself with household disinfectants. Learn how to safely dispose of household items that are in your household, including items such as utensils, linens, dishwashers, dryers, light switches, and other household cleaning
