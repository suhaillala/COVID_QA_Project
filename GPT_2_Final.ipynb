              "'ndoftext|> Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause a range of respiratory diseases including colds, flu, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).  \\n\\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is called the \"common cold\", and is caused by the common cold adenovirus.  The virus causes about 80% of the world\\'s respiratory infections, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and it is thought to be mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\\n\\n\\n  In the United States, the most common form of infection is respiratory syncytial fluid (RSD), which is a fluid-like fluid that is expelled from the upper respiratory tract when a respiratory infection occurs. This fluid is then expelled into the air, where it can be inhaled by people who are nearby or have close contact with someone who has the virus. However, there is no known way to precisely measure the amount of RSD in a person’s airways, or how much is in it, in order to determine whether the person is at higher risk of developing the disease. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways in which people can safely and effectively use respiratory steroids, including corticosteroids and antacids, to prevent, treat and prevent the spread of this potentially life-threatening illness. The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against the infection are to regularly clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people you are close to. Follow the directions of your local health authority (WHO) on how to maintain good air quality in your home, workplace and community. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.

              "'ndoftext|> Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new virus that has not been previously identified in humans. It is thought to be caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2.\\n\\nThe virus is believed to cause the following symptoms: fever, tiredness, and shortness of breath. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. They may last for several days or may be worse than usual. Some people become infected but do not develop any symptoms. \\n\\n\\n  The symptoms described by some patients are similar to those experienced by other coronaviruses, such as the common cold and the flu. However, they are different in severity and severity are not always consistent. For example, a person with a fever of 103.5°C and no symptoms for 14 days may develop a severe case of the virus. Other patients with similar symptoms may also develop pneumonia or other respiratory infections. The severity of these symptoms varies from person to person, depending on the underlying disease. In some cases, the severity may change significantly over time, leading to changes in the way the disease is transmitted. This is why it is important to regularly clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. Follow the directions of your local health authority and local public health authorities for any restrictions on travel, movement and gatherings. If you are travelling in a group, ensure that you follow the same rules and regulations as other people in your group. Avoid close contact with anyone who is sick or has a history of respiratory illness. Do not touch or touch your eyes, nose or mouth. Why? Hands touch the ground, surfaces or objects that are about to fall or fall into the wrong hands. Hands can pick up viruses and contaminate food, drink and other personal items. WHO is assessing ongoing research to understand the full range of potential health threats to people living with HIV and how they can protect themselves and their loved ones.

              "'ndoftext|> Yes, she has. \\n\\nHer symptoms are similar to those of other coronavirus patients, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Her doctor recommends that you take her to the emergency room, where she is being cared for, to be tested for the virus. She should be able to walk normally and is showing no signs of illness. However, her doctor is concerned that she may be acting abnormally and that her symptoms may not be the same as that of the flu, which she described as \"very scary\".  Her family is currently in the care of a specialist in Covid-19, who is treating her with carerty.com.au. Ms. Konyndyk said she had been in contact with a number of people who had similar symptoms, but none of them were as severe as she was.\\nShe described how her mother had struggled with her anxiety and depression for years, before she developed the symptoms. \"She was very self-centred and she didn\\'t have any problems at all,\" she told CTV’s Your Morning on March 27, shortly after she started showing symptoms of coronovirus. The family has since moved into a new flat in Wuhan, a town in China\\'s Hubei province, with the aim of moving to a more remote location. But the family\\'s concerns have now been put to rest, as they are now looking for a way to continue their lives without worrying about what could happen to them if they do end up living in a house with someone who has the disease.\\n\\n\\nSo far, there is no evidence that any family member has been infected, although it is thought that at least one other person may have been. It is not yet known how long the illness will last, or whether it will lead to permanent changes to their behaviour. Dr. Jennifer Ashton, an infectious disease specialist at the Royal College of Midwives, said that people should continue to practise good respiratory hygiene, such as washing their hands with soap and water and avoiding touching their eyes, nose or mouth. They should also avoid touching objects or surfaces that are covered in dirt or debris, like tables, chairs or tables. And they should not touch any objects that have a surface on them or in their path that could pose a risk of infection. If you are worried about your child\\'s health or wellbeing, you should talk to your doctor or other health care provider.

              "' I am a PhD student in epidemiology and bioinformatics at the University of Waterloo. \\n\\nI am looking for a way to model the spread of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in a population of patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARS) and their family members (L-R).  The model is based on the observation that the number of confirmed cases in the population is increasing every day, and that this increase in cases is due to a combination of factors:\\n\\n\\nincreased hospitalisation,\\nincreasing numbers of hospitalisations and deaths.\\nThe model also assumes that patients are being cared for in isolation, so that they are not exposed to the virus in any way (e.g. they do not cough, sneeze, etc.).  In addition, the model assumes a constant infection rate of about 0.1%.  This means that if I were to extrapolate the exponential growth of the epidemic to all patients in my cohort, I would need to take into account the fact that there are many more patients than expected to die in this cohort (and this is assuming that we expect to have no more than 1000 new cases per day in our cohort), and this would be a significant (but not overwhelming) source of false positives (see here for an example of this in action).\\nTo my knowledge, there is no published data to support this model, but it seems to me that it is a reasonable model to use for estimating the relative risks of an epidemic in an otherwise random population, given the known risk factors associated with the disease, such as age, sex, education level, geographic location, occupation, family history, physical activity level and other factors that are known to be important predictors of mortality in such a large-scale epidemiologic outbreak. I have tried to find a model that can be used for this purpose, using the following parameters:\\nAge (in years)\\nPhysical activity (for example, for children and adolescents, or for adults and children aged 0–19 years, as well as for those with underlying medical conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, high blood pressure, chronic respiratory disease or cancer)  (or any other type of activity that is important for the prevention and control of infection) Age and sex\\nInfected by other infectious diseases (including HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, HIV-1, pneumonias, adenovirus, enteroviruses, Epstein-Barr, rabies, hepatitis, leishmaniosis, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, septic shock, acute myelitis, polymyxternal poly(A) infection, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronaviruse-2019/summary-of-infectious-conditions-in-the-world/2020.do?spm=article.view&amp;id=20.01.2020) or acquired immune-compromise (AIDS) by means of immunoglobulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2) antibody titers (Figure 1A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, VI, X, Y, Z, AA, NP, AD, BB, CS, AE, NL, PL, PM, NR, TA, MH, SK, LF, TN, UA, BC, AF, CO, ID, AK, NE, NH, NJ, NY, NC, CT, DC, OR, ME, KR, SD, WY)\\n\\n\\n\\n  ######\\n#####\\n##\\n###  #############################################################################\\n# ###\\n  SIR &lt;- seq(0, 1, length(SIR))\\nfor (i in range(1-length(RSS))):\\ns = np.zeros((T[i],  s,  dbinom(s, i)))\\nif not s: return -gt; 0\\nset.seed(12) # plot mean\\nplot(day, ncol=10, xlab = \"day\", ylab=\"% of days since last observation\")\\naxis(ylim = c(10^5, 10^3, cex.out=1000, lwd = 0, col = 1)) # mean of observed cases\\nday = day - log(days/(N-days)/N)'"
