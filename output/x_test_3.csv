" The most common risk factors for developing severe illness are:

High blood pressure
Poor respiratory hygiene
Smoking or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer
Diarrhea, tiredness, and shortness of breath
Irritants and other respiratory illnesses
Severe respiratory infections (e.g., pneumonia, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus)
Pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), and influenza (H1N1, Influenza A, MERS and related viruses)


So, if you have any of these symptoms, seek medical attention and call in advance to make arrangements for your child to be isolated and cared for at home.  If you are concerned about the child's health and wellbeing, seek medical advice from a health care provider before, during and after the visit.
If you have any other health concerns, call your local health authority to ensure they are aware of any conditions that may be impaired for the child and consider whether you should provide medical attention to these persons.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"

" What is the current status of COVID-2019 and how can I protect myself and my loved ones from the new coronavirus? The World Health Organization (WHO) has advised against close contact with people with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. However, there are currently no known treatments or vaccines that can prevent or cure the disease. WHO urges people to stay at home and away from others, including their children and pregnant women, as well as those with underlying medical conditions.  If you or someone you know is at high risk for severe illness or death, call your healthcare provider right away to make sure you and your loved one are safe and sound. For people living with HIV, the most effective ways to protect themselves and others against the newly-discovered virus are to regularly clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. If you have fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority and the local government’s lead health care provider if you are worried about how your health condition is being managed or how you may be at risk of developing or spreading the illness.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" The current data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can survive for up to 14 days in water, air, and air-conditioned environments. However, there are no published data to support this claim.  In addition, it is not known whether the virus is able to survive in these environments for longer periods of time, or if it can be transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets expelled from a person with COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the current study is of limited value as it does not address the possibility of transmission from aerosols or other sources of exposure to persons who have recently been exposed to this novel coronavirus. Further, this study was limited in its sample size, so further investigation is needed to understand the full range of possible exposures that may be present in the population of Wuhan, China, as well as the potential for transmission to other cities and other areas around the world.

Wikipedia article:   ""The Long-term Effects of Copper and Other Copper-Based Porous Substances on Human Corticosteroids in Patients With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ""  (2020) by Dr. Anthony Fauci, MD, PhD, is an internationally recognized authority on the safety and efficacy of copper and its related compounds for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).  He is the author of numerous peer-reviewed and critically-acclaimed articles, including the 2014 edition of the Journal of Clinical Investigation, which was published by Elsevier Science in January 2019; the 2016 edition, in Nature Medicine; and the 2017 edition in Archives of Internal Medicine. He has also authored numerous articles and papers, most recently of which have been published in PLOS ONE, Science Advances, JAMA, BMJ, Archives Of General Medical Sciences, Cell Metabolism, BioRxiv, Translational Medicine, Medicine Today, Medical Hypotheses, Journal Of The American College Of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, The Lancet, March 2020, doi:10.1016/j.meas.2020.03.022
Dr. F.Faucio is a professor of medicine at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. His primary research interests are infectious diseases and infectious disease prevention and control (IPC). He holds a Ph.D. in microbiology and immunology from the Australian National University (ANU) and an M.S.A. (Doctoral Dissertation) from Imperial College London. Currently, he is pursuing a PhD in bioinformatics and biophysics from Harvard University, with a focus on emerging viral RNA viruses (e.g., HIV/AIDS, MERS, Ebola, HIV-1, Zika, etc.) and is currently a postdoc on a project to develop a vaccine to prevent and treat the common cold (COVID19). His current research focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of influenza virus (H1N1), and on developing vaccines and therapeutics to protect against the disease.

" This is a question that has been around for a while now, but I think it is really important to understand what is going on with the coronavirus and how it spreads.  So I am going to try to answer this question in a more general way, by asking a bit more about the different types of viruses that are known to cause the common cold, such as the SARS-CoV-2, the MERS virus and the Ebola virus, which are also known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) viruses, as well as a number of other viruses which cause respiratory infections, e.g. the Epstein–Barr virus (Ebola), the Coronaviruses (SARS and CoV).  I hope this answer will help answer some of your own questions, so that you don't end up with a false sense of security when you think you are being infected by a virus which is not related to your current medical condition, i.e. you have a fever, cough, shortness of breath and/or no symptoms at all, all of which can cause you to develop symptoms which may be worse than what you would get if you had just been exposed to the same virus all the time in your body?  Also, is there any way to know if the virus is actually spreading from person to person or is spreading through droplets produced by the body rather than through the air? I mean, does this mean that the viral particles are actually moving around more or less like a fluid, or are they just moving in different directions? Or is this just a way of saying that there is some sort of ""flattening"" or ""dynamic"" effect which means that if one particle moves more than one direction, then the other particle will move in opposite directions, for example by moving more towards the right or the left side of a room or vice versa, etc? If so, what are the differences between the two viruses and why do they differ in their pathogenicity and virulence? Do any of these differences have any bearing on the development of symptoms in people who are currently infected or have not been in contact with any viruses for at least a few days? Thanks in advance for your help!

" The CDC recommends washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds to kill the virus. But that doesn't mean covering your mouth, nose or mouth with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. You can also use a tissue to hold your mask in place, but it’s best to use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if you're concerned about the risk of catching COVID-19 from your hands.
 If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Follow CDC guidance on hand hygiene and contact lens wear and care when touching objects or surfaces, including your face, hands and face shield, according to the CDC. (Learn more about how to wear an eye mask.)
 But some people who have the coronavirus need to stay home for 14 days to have symptoms, and that can be difficult if they have underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer or cancer of the nose, mouth or small bowel, a CDC study found. And people with underlying health conditions can develop fever and other respiratory illnesses. For children and young adults, who are at higher risk for serious illness, wearing a face mask can help protect them from viruses that could be on their hands or in their eyes, lips or nose — and could also be a good idea to avoid touching the front of your gown or other close-fitting clothing, which can prevent viruses from reaching your eyes and nose.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"

" No. The virus that causes COVID-19 can be passed from person to person through droplets from coughs or sneezes. It can also be transmitted through food or drink. People who have the virus can shed it into their bodies, and those who don't have it can get it from others.
People who are immunocompromised are more likely to be able to transmit the disease, according to the World Health Organization. But some people can develop symptoms and develop serious illness. That's why it’s important to talk with your healthcare provider about whether you or someone you know is at high risk for developing a severe illness — especially if you're an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. If you have certain health conditions, like high blood pressure, you should be tested for the illness, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. You should also talk to your doctor about any changes in your eating habits, such as taking a regular, low-calorie, non-sugar-based shake or eating a healthy, whole-wheat protein shake, he said.  
 People with underlying medical conditions also have a higher risk of developing symptoms, including fever, cough and shortness of breath. Some people also develop fever more frequently than others, which can cause them to feel sick more often. For most people, that means they get sicklier each day, but some may also experience fever themselves, or they may have other medical problems that limit their ability to get a full-blown cold or flu, experts say. In some cases, those symptoms may be worse than they would be if they had no health condition at the time of their infection, so doctors can't rule out other causes of illness that could be at play in how your body makes and uses antibodies to fight off the new virus.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"

" If you are worried about getting sick with COVID-19, you should talk to your veterinarian.

If you have symptoms, call your local hospital or local health department and talk with your pet's health care provider about the best ways to protect yourself and your family. If possible, avoid close contact with people who are sick or need to be hospitalized, according to the American College of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (ACAA).
“It’s important to stay home when you're sick,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the chief of the U.S. respiratory and gastrointestinal medicine at the University of Minnesota. 
 But if you get sick from someone who is not ill, seek medical attention and call in advance, he said. You should also wash your hands often with soap and water, and avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Follow the directions of your state and local public health officials, who can tell you if there is a risk to you or others nearby that you may be at increased risk of catching the coronavirus. The CDC recommends that people stay at least 6 feet away from others, including their pets and anyone with a cough or sneeze, if they have a fever or are in a state of high risk for developing a respiratory infection, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, cancer or other chronic conditions, as well as those with underlying medical conditions or a history of other health problems, like diabetes or cancer. For more information on how to care for and treat pets, visit the pet care website at pet.acaa.gov or call 1-800-FIV-TALK (1-888-407-4444) or visit pethealth.org.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" If you have been exposed to the virus and have symptoms, seek medical attention and call in advance.
If you develop symptoms and are not able to leave your home within 14 days of being placed in the isolation unit, you should call your local health authority and arrange for a full-time, 24-hour hotline to be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to answer your questions and provide information about your health condition. You should also take extra precautions to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth, and to wash your hands before and after handling the body of the deceased person.


  The World Health Organisation (WHO) has advised that all people living with HIV and those with underlying medical conditions should be encouraged to regularly clean their hands with the use of a disinfectant such as soap and water, as well as using hand sanitizer and hand rub. However, there is no evidence to suggest that handwashing is effective in preventing or treating the coronavirus. WHO advice remains the same as for other infectious diseases, including influenza, which is not currently considered to pose a risk to public health. For more information on how to safely and effectively use hand hygiene, see WHO guidance on hand washing and hand hygiene from the Public Health Agency of Colombia (PHAC).

" The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly spread from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. This virus can be transmitted through contact with bodily fluids, food, and/or fluids from a person who has been infected. The WHO has advised against touching, inhaling, or touching the eyes, nose, mouth or eyes of anyone who is infected, as this could lead to the virus spreading to others.

WHO recommends that all people aged over 60 be advised to wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after touching a surface or object. People with underlying medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease, should be encouraged to use hand sanitizer if they are concerned about the risk of catching the coronavirus.

" Yes, but don't forget to wash your hands before and after handling the body of someone who has COVID-19.

If you’re coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue and throw the tissue in the trash. Then dispose of it immediately, according to the CDC. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, a coronavirus expert at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. Follow the directions of your local health authority and local public health authorities, and use hand sanitizer if you're feeling particularly unwell, he said.


The CDC recommends washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, before touching your face, hands or face cover, to stop the spread of the virus. But that's not enough time, experts say. Hands should be left at home, away from people who are sick or are in close contact with people with the disease, such as their pets, their elderly or those with underlying medical conditions, or their healthcare provider, if they are ill or in a state of high fever and/or symptoms, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease or lung disease.

" I am a PhD student in bioinformatics at the University of Waterloo, Canada. My advisor is a professor of microbiology and immunology. She is also a co-author on a paper on the topic of SARS-CoV-2, which was published last week in Nature.  She has also been a contributing editor to several journals, including Nature, Nature Biotechnology, Science Advances, Cell Metab, PLOS ONE, PLoS One and the Journal of Cell Biology. In addition, she is an advisor to BioRxiv, an open access journal that publishes scientific papers from all over the world. Her research interests are in understanding the biology of viruses and their interactions with other viruses, as well as their pathogenicity, virulence and mutability in order to better understand how viruses are transmitted and how they may be transmitted between humans and animals. Currently, her research focuses on understanding how COVID-19 is spread between animals and humans through direct contact with infected animals (e.g., through respiratory droplets).  Her current research is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and a grant from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (RCOG). She currently lives in Vancouver, British Columbia, with her husband and two young children, in an apartment complex with a large outdoor market and outdoor swimming pool, where she has been working since January. The couple has two cats, a rabbit and an Asian rabbit, both of whom have been adopted by her as her primary carer since she moved in with them from China to Vancouver a few months ago. They are both healthy and happily adoptable, so they are looking forward to learning more about their new home and adopting them as soon as possible. Their cat, however, is still very much a stray and is not allowed to visit them outside of her apartment, except for occasional walks and occasional visits to her dog, who is happily neutered every two weeks. As a result, their cat is now in a state of constant fear and anxiety because of this new situation and wants to keep her distance from her cat and other stray animals, especially stray cats and stray dogs who are regularly walking their dogs and cats outside their apartment. However, this does not mean that they do not want to adopt the stray cat or stray dog. Rather, they want the cat to remain at their home for as long as they can, even if it is for short periods of time, to help them with their daily chores, such as cleaning and feeding their dog or cat. This is why they have decided to continue their current routine of keeping their pets at home (i.e., keeping them at least 6 feet away from other people) and are now encouraging their pet owners to do the same for their own pets. It is hoped that this will lead to a decrease in animal-to-human transmission and that the situation will be managed better by encouraging the use of veterinary methods to reduce the risk of unnecessary contact between pets and people who might be at higher risk for severe illness or for other health conditions.

" Testing for COVID-19 is a complex and time-consuming process, so it is best to consult with your healthcare provider before beginning any new routine medical treatment.

If you have symptoms, such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. If you develop symptoms and need to leave the hospital, call 911 or the U.S. Children's Hospital in Washington, D.C., or visit the American Red Cross’s website at https://www.redcross.org/emergency-medicine/stay-home-for-your-childrens-and-families.html.

" There is no evidence to support the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of COVID-19. However, there is a growing body of research that suggests that certain drugs may be effective against the coronavirus. For example, a recent study found that ibuprofen (Advil, Zoloft) and naproxen (Valium) had similar side effects, although they were not as effective as flu shot.

In light of the current pandemic, is there a need for clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of these medicines? 
 I am interested in hearing your thoughts on this question, and if so, what are the ethical and legal implications of using a drug that is not currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention, treatment and cure of common colds, such as influenza, as an adjuvant to prevent the spread of disease? I would also like to know if there are any ethical or legal considerations that would prevent this drug from being used in a clinical setting, or if it should instead be reserved for research purposes?


Thanks in advance for your answers!

" WHO stands by its longstanding position that all countries should follow the recommendations of the WHO Regional Committee on Coronaviruses and Related Health Problems (PCRHC).  

However, there is a growing body of scientific literature that challenges this view. For example, in the journal Nature Medicine, a team of researchers from the University of Queensland and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine published a paper in January that found that the combination of ibuprofen and hydroxychloroquine (H2O2) did not significantly increase the risk of severe acute respiratory infection (SARS-CoV) among people living with HIV in a study in Wuhan, China. However, they note that this study was limited in its sample size, and that it was not designed to assess the long-term safety of this combination. 


  In addition, the authors argue that ""the results are not conclusive and may not reflect the full range of human-to-human transmission risks associated with the novel coronavirus"" and ""may be subject to bias and underrepresentation of other risk factors, including age, sex, geographic location and other factors that may contribute to the variability in risk.""  The authors also point out that they ""did not find evidence of a significant increase in hospitalizations or deaths among HIV-negative people in China, but rather a modest decrease in infections among those who had been previously infected, suggesting that these patients may have been at higher risk for severe illness and death."" The paper was co-authored by a group of scientists from China and a U.S. university, both of which have published peer-reviewed scientific papers on this topic. The Lancet has also published an opinion piece in March that critiques the paper, arguing that its authors' conclusions are ""ridiculous and misleading,"" while the Lancet's own editor-in-chief, Dominic Raab, has called it ""utterly false."" In response to these criticisms, WHO has issued a statement that reads more in-depth in detail about the study's limitations and its findings, which it says is ""not peer reviewed and does not meet the standards of peer review that would be expected of an authoritative scientific journal."" It goes on to say that, ""while the results may be preliminary and preliminary, we are confident that their results will inform the development of treatments and vaccines that can prevent, cure and treat COV-related diseases. We look forward to working with them to develop a vaccine and vaccine that is safe and effective for all of us, regardless of our sex or medical condition.""
The Lancet article also points to a WHO press release that says that:  ""WHO is assessing the data and will continue to share updated findings as they become available. [...] We will update this information as soon as we learn of new findings and are able to provide more detailed information about how these findings are being interpreted and interpreted by health authorities around the world."" This is, of course, very early information, so it is not yet clear whether it will be updated at the same time as WHO publishes its own scientific publications, or whether the updated information will also be accompanied by additional commentary from WHO spokespeople and public health officials. But, given the current state of uncertainty surrounding the outbreak, it seems likely that WHO will publish updated scientific reports on their own, rather than relying on a single authoritative source to interpret and interpret the latest scientific information. In any case, is there any scientific consensus regarding the effectiveness of any new drug, vaccine or treatment in preventing, treating, diagnosing or treating COVs or related health conditions, other than those that are currently under investigation by the Chinese government? Or are there other scientific issues that need to be addressed in order to determine whether new drugs, vaccines or treatments can be safely and effectively used in some circumstances, such as in an outbreak where the number of cases is expected to increase?
So, what are the scientific arguments for or against using the drug/vaccine/treatment/therapy/etc. in certain situations? Do any of these arguments have any basis in reality or are they just a fig leaf for a political or propaganda ploy to further their political aims? If so, how does this argument fit into the broader WHO/NCR/CDC/WHO/MOIs/whatever conspiracy theories/false-positions being propagated by these conspiracy-mongers, who are apparently trying to spread misinformation and scare the public into thinking they are somehow acting in concert to protect the global health system from a potentially catastrophic pandemic? I am not an expert in epidemiology, nor do I have the expertise to answer these questions directly. I do however, have a PhD in molecular biology and am interested in understanding the mechanisms by which viruses mutate and adapt to different environmental conditions and to what extent they can survive in these environments. So, I would appreciate any suggestions on how to proceed in this area, especially if you"

" What is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from the new coronavirus?

This is a rapidly evolving and evolving situation, so it's best to stay informed and follow the advice of your healthcare provider. However, there are a number of things you can do to reduce your risk of catching the disease. For example, avoid touching your face, nose or mouth. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Seek medical advice from a local health authority, including your local GP or local emergency services. Talk to your GP about any concerns you may have about how your health is being managed and how you are being cared for. You should also take extra precautions, such as washing your hands frequently with soap and water, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and taking extra special care to ensure they are well fed and well hydrated. And remember, it’s important to keep up to date on the latest local and national news, soap and beauty products, as well as any local newsagents and mobile phone apps you might be using.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
