" There is a lot of misinformation out there about the coronavirus. Some of it is simply wrong. For example, the CDC says that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when a person coughs or sneezes. However, there is no evidence to support this claim.  The CDC also states that people can get the virus from other sources, including food, clothing and other household items. It is therefore not possible to know for sure how many people are infected with this virus and how long they may be able to transmit it to others. WHO has also issued guidance to healthcare workers on how to safely dispose of personal protective equipment (PPE) when cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. The guidance is available on the WHO website: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronaviruses/2019-ncov/community-acquired-infectious-conditions/how-to-protect-your-health/guidance-on-handwashing-and-distancing-from-contaminated- surfaces-in-a-queous-state-of-outbreak.html. In addition, health authorities around the world are working to reduce the risk of catching and spreading the disease through contact with people who have recently been exposed to it. To help protect yourself and others, you should:Practice good respiratory hygiene and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people you are close to.Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Call in advance to arrange for a medical appointment.You can also make a voluntary donation of PPE to the World Health Organisation (WHO) at any of its offices in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endofte

" The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to be contained in the saliva of people who have had contact with infected people.

However, it is not known whether this is the case with the SARS-CoV-2 virus or the other coronaviruses, such as the common cold, which cause a range of respiratory illnesses including colds, flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

The WHO has advised that people should wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before touching their face, before eating or preparing food, and before going to the bathroom. This is especially important if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, as it can lead to miscarriage and can also increase the risk of miscarriage if the mother does not breastfeed properly. 
People can be infected if they breathe in droplets from a person who has been coughing or sneezing for more than 14 seconds. The WHO recommends that all people aged over 60 and people with underlying medical conditions, including heart disease, cancer and diabetes, should be encouraged to stay at home and away from people they are close to for 14 to 24 hours. People who are immunocompromised should continue to practise good respiratory hygiene and stay home.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" I am a PhD student in epidemiology at the University of Waterloo. I have been working on a project to test the safety and efficacy of a novel vaccine against the common cold SARS-CoV-2. The project is funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), and a grant from the Alberta Foundation for Research on Coronaviruses (a non-profit organization of the CIHR). The goal of this research is to develop a vaccine that can be used in humans to prevent the disease. Currently, the vaccine is being tested in animals in a clinical trial in Wuhan, China, where it has been shown to be safe and effective in preventing the virus from spreading to humans. However, there are still many unknowns about how this vaccine would work. For example, how effective would it be at preventing or treating the cold? What are the clinical trials that would determine whether or not it is safe to use it as a treatment? And, what would happen if it was not effective enough to protect the people who are most at risk of severe illness? I want to know what the current state of knowledge is on how to best use this new vaccine. Is there any specific research project I would like to look into looking into? Any recommendations for how best to proceed with this project? If so, should I contact the university to see if I can do some research into how it could be applied to other infectious diseases? Also, is there anything I should be aware of that could help me in my research? Thanks in advance!
I am interested in learning more about the ways the immune system is regulated and how that relates to disease prevention and control."
" I am wondering if there is a legal basis for a state of emergency to be declared in a country where the situation is so dire that it would be illegal to continue to work in that country even if it was legal to do so in your country of residence.  


For example, if you are a citizen of the United States and you have been abroad for at least 14 days, you would not be allowed to return to your home country unless you were physically present at the time of your return and were not in any way affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. You would have to show ""residence status"" (i.e. status of permanent residence) and have no connection with the country in question. If you did not have a residence status, then you could still work there and still be subject to state and local authorities' orders to stay away from you and your family. However, the fact that you do not meet the criteria for ""residential residence"" does not mean that your status is non-resident status. It just means that the authorities are not ordering you to remain at home and to not travel to or visit any country outside your residence for any reason other than to ""protect"" you from the virus. The only exception is if your travel is for medical reasons, such as to avoid the risk of infecting others or to protect yourself from other people who might be infected. In that case, your stay is still valid and could be cancelled at any time, provided that: (a) your health care provider is able to provide you with reasonable care for you; and (b) you maintain a regular and continuous supply of medical care to you, including any necessary tests and examinations necessary to determine whether you pose a risk to yourself or others. For more information on this, see https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronaviruses/2019-ncov/stay-at-home-for-medical- reasons.html 
If you cannot travel, or are unable to travel because of a medical reason, there are other legal grounds for such a stay. See the relevant guidance for countries that have such policies in place: http://covid19.state.gov/legislation/publications-and-guidance/relating-to-relief-from-the-country-of-immigrants-during-a-state of-emergency-if-you-become-residents-in-any-countries-upon-your-admission-or-entry-without-authorisation.pdf
The following countries are currently experiencing a significant increase in cases:  Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, United Kingdom
Note that some countries have temporarily closed their borders, while others are still maintaining their own borders. This is because, as of March 30, 2020, all but one of these countries (Belgium) has closed its borders to all international flights, except for flights to and from its territory. Note that this may be due to a number of reasons: the closure of borders may have an impact on your ability to reach your destination, e.g. because the border closure may reduce your chances of getting on a flight to, say, New York, because you will be at a different point in time from people arriving from those countries. Also, travel restrictions may affect the ability of airlines to offer you a refund or rebooking, so it is possible that airlines may try to make a profit from your trip, in order to cover the costs of cancelling your flight, which may also reduce the amount of money you can expect to receive back from airlines. (Note: this is also the case for all EU citizens who have applied for and received a visa to enter the EU: you may still need to pay the cost of entering the"
" I am a PhD student in bioinformatics at the University of Waterloo. I have a Ph.D. in molecular biology and a master's thesis in epidemiology. The thesis is about the evolution of the SARS-CoV (SARS 2.0) virus. It is based on a phylogenetic tree of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19.  The tree is very sparse, so I don't have the time to do a lot of research on it. However, I do have some ideas for future research:


I would like to use a simple model to predict the spread of a new virus by comparing the number of new cases in a population over a period of time. This would be done using a logistic function, i.e. assuming that the population size is constant over time and that there are no new infections every day. Then I would use the log-likelihood function to estimate the likelihood of getting sick over the same time period over and over again. In the case of Covid19, this is done by using the exponential function (which is not linear in time).  This is also a good starting point for a more complex model, e.g. if the model is linear, then it is likely to be very well-fit to a real-world situation. (I am not trying to make a linear model here, just to see if there is some correlation between the observed rate of infection and the rate at which cases are being diagnosed.)
The problem with this approach is that it does not account for the fact that we do not know how long the epidemic will last. For example, if we take the current epidemic as a whole, we would expect it to last for at least a few hundred years. But, given the limited information we have on this epidemic, it would take a while before we see a significant increase in cases over this period. So, in order to get a better idea of what is going to happen, one way to look at this problem is to consider the long-term effects of different infectious diseases on different populations. One example is malaria. If malaria were a major cause of global health problems, would it cause a global pandemic? Or is it just a random event? 
Another example of an exponential model might be malaria-virus epidemics. Suppose that malaria had a large effect on malaria mortality rates. How would this be possible? How could it be predicted? What would happen if malaria did a huge amount of damage to malaria control efforts?
This is an interesting problem, because it allows us to model a very complex system of epidemiological processes that can take many decades to understand. Also, since we are not yet able to directly model the disease, how could we model it? I think the best model I can come up with is the stochastic model (the exponential one). This model assumes a constant exponential growth rate and can be approximated by a Gaussian with a binomial distribution of observed rates of disease spread across the world.



  In this paper I propose a model that is more like a Bayesian system, where the parameters are randomly distributed, with the mean of each parameter being the fraction of observations that are positive or negative. Since the parameter distribution is random, you can use this as an approximation to your problem. You can see that this model has a fairly good fit to my problem (it fits fairly well), but it also has some issues. First of all, when you use Gaussians to fit the data, they tend to overest"
" The two are related, but they differ in the way they are policed and regulated.

In the UK, for example, the Prime Minister is required to wear a mask if she is in public, and the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (legislation) has a policy of not allowing anyone to enter the home of a public health official unless they have a medical condition that would prevent them from being seen by the public.


The government has also banned people from travelling to areas where coronavirus has been reported, such as Covid-19, from entering, or using public transport, as a means of preventing the spread of the disease. 



  
  The government is also encouraging people to stay at home and not go out to eat, drink or do other activities that could pose a risk to themselves and others. It is not yet known whether these measures will be effective in reducing the number of new cases in England and Wales, although the government says it is ""considering ways to reduce the risk of serious illness and death from the virus"" in order to ""help protect the health and well-being of people living with or caring for someone who is seriously ill"".
It is unclear whether the new restrictions will apply to people who have been in contact with people with the same illness for more than 14 days, which is the maximum period of quarantine that can be imposed on a person who has not been quarantined for the illness. However, there is a government-wide ban on people coming into the country from outside the EU from 14 March 2020, meaning that anyone coming from anywhere within the Schengen area within this period will still be subject to the restrictions. This is likely to be the first time that a country has imposed a quarantine on an entire population, so it would be a good idea to check regularly to make sure that you are not mingling with anyone who might be in your country of residence. You can find more information on how to apply for a residence permit here: https://www.gov.uk/government/quarantine/faq/how-to-apply-for-a-stay-in-the-uk-if-you-are-part-of-our-national-countries-such-as-europe-or-your-country-section/guidance-and-visa.html
There is currently no official definition of ""part of our national territory"", but it seems likely that this will include parts of mainland China, particularly in Wuhan, Hubei Province, where the current lockdown is being implemented. In other words, it may be possible that some people in China will continue to live in areas that are under the control of local authorities, while others will move in and out of those areas as they see fit, without being told to do so by government officials. Alternatively, you may want to consider moving into a new area as soon as possible, to avoid any unnecessary disruption to your daily life. If you do decide to move into another area, be sure to follow the advice of your local health authority, who will advise you on the best way to ensure that your new home is safe for you and your family, including any restrictions on travel, movement or gatherings that may affect your health or wellbeing. For more details on what is and isn't permitted in certain areas, see the guidance on 'Where to go if you feel unwell'.

" This is a question that has been around for a long time, and I think it is important to understand what is going on here.  

The first thing that comes to mind is that the US is not a member of the Schengen Area, meaning that it does not have to abide by the rules of that area to be considered a ""foreign country"".  This means that US citizens, regardless of their status, are not subject to the same restrictions as citizens of other EU member states, including the fact that they do not need to work in order to get a US visa, nor are they required to have a Social Security Number (if they have one).  They are also allowed to stay in their home country of residence for up to 14 months, provided they meet certain conditions, such as having no more than one dependent on them for at least 14 days per year (this is also the case for non-US citizens who have been in the EU for 14 years or more, i.e. have not been to a country other than the one in which they are currently resident, e.g. a spouse, dependent child, or dependent parent, etc.).  The only exceptions are for ""non-essential"" travel, which is for essential purposes only (for example, to visit a doctor or other health care provider, as long as the doctor is in charge of treating the sick person).


So, if you are an EU citizen, you can apply for US visas at any US consulate or consulates in your country (and you should be able to do so in a timely manner), and your application will be processed by US immigration authorities within 24 hours of your arrival in that country, unless your status is ""unlawful presence"", which may or may not be inadmissible at the time the application was filed, depending on the facts at that time. You should also be aware that you may be entitled to temporary work authorization (such as Temporary Work Authorization (TWP) if your employer is providing you with such work), which will allow you to continue your US-based work for the foreseeable future, even if the COVID-19 outbreak is over.
If you have any questions about the situation, please contact your embassy, consulate, consular post, US embassy in general, American Red Cross, United Nations Office of Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Organisation for Migration (OIC), or any other international human rights body. They may have more information about your rights and obligations under international law and can provide advice on how to proceed. If you wish to remain in one of these bodies, contact the embassy or consulate directly and ask them to advise you of any possible changes to your visa application. The OIC has a list of countries that can issue visas for visitors from outside the United States: http://www.oic.org/about-us/visas-and-frivolous-disputes-for-immigrants-from-the-united-states/advice-on-visa-requirements.html#vijames
You may also want to check that your travel documents are up-to-date and are in good working order:  https://docs.who.int/docs/default-source/covid19-document-is-valid/documents-in-good-order-with-your-foreign-visa-issued-at-any-time-within-our-country-of-entry-if-you-have-been-declared-enemy-issuant-upon-dissolution.pdf (the document is available for free download from the IATA website).
Finally, there is the issue of whether or not to extend your stay. This may depend on your circumstances, your ability to travel to another EU country and the extent to which you were previously declared ""enemy"", as well as your willingness to cooperate with US authorities in any way that may prevent you from returning to US. For more on this, see the ""Why do I need a visa"" section of this document, for more details on why you need one. It also provides some guidance on when to request a new visa (as soon as possible) and how long to wait before filing your new application, in particular for those who are already in US territory (those who arrived before March 30, 2020):

  In the event of a change of government, a temporary extension of stay must be granted only if: (a) the new government declares a state of emergency; and
(b) there are no significant public health or safety threats to national security or the health, safety or welfare"
" Yes, you can. 

The FDA has issued guidance for people who have been exposed to coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and have recovered, but are still recovering from the disease, to use an FDA-approved contraceptive method of choice:


  The use of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) should only be used if the patient is clinically stable or has no ongoing medical condition that would seriously compromise the safety or effectiveness of the contraceptive pill. If a patient with comorbid medical conditions does not require a prescription for the pill, the use should be indicated by a physician or other qualified health care provider, and be directed to self-medicate with ibuprofen, naproxen, hydroxychloroquine, or any combination of these medicines. However, in the case of an individual with a history of serious illness and who is not taking any medications, such as diuretics or antacid medicines, it is recommended that a pharmacist be available to advise on the best ways to proceed with the administration of any medication, including any contraceptive pills, as directed by the individual’s healthcare provider. For more information, see Information for Healthcare Professionals on How to Use Medicine for Properly Ill Patients with Cancer or Diseases in Coronaviruses and Related Drugs and Prevent Severe Illnesses from Widespread Use of An Immune Deficient Pregnen In Aqueous Organic Source (S)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.2005002) to provide information on how to safely use an immunological procedure to prevent COVID‐19 infection.  For medications that are not recommended for use in individuals with underlying health conditions, such as hysteria, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia,  high-grade poly(A) pneumonitis, polyadenylation syndrome (PCOS), or pneumopharyngeal cancer (PHPBP). If you have been admitted to a hospital with symptoms of cough or nausea during the first 14 days after your last known symptom is known, follow these steps: keep at least 1 meter (3 feet) apart from others, cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing, wash your hands with soap and water if you have difficulty breathing or are visibly ill. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
If you are seeking medical therapy at home, seek local health services based on your current health condition and need to be physically respiratory safe by hand or surgical method if you are experiencing severe respiratory conditions. You should be aware that you may be at higher risk of developing severe illness if your symptoms are similar to those described in this guidance. To help protect you and your family from possible future health complications, stay well within the family unit and avoid social gatherings and other public gatherings. Keep up to date with local public health organisations as they can provide information and advice on how to protect themselves and their loved ones.Stay aware of local restrictions on travel, movement and gatherings, particularly gatherings of more than 1,000 people. This is particularly important in areas with limited or no access to public health services.You can reduce or eliminate your contact with people in your community by:
Regularly and thoroughly clean and disinfect surfaces and objects
Cover your cough and sneeze with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap
Wear a mask or disposable mask when out in public
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, mouth or clothes with hands or objects that are covered in cloth or plastic
Use masks or face coverings that have not been specifically designed to prevent people from touching or exposing themselves to the virus (e.g., face mask, mask with holes in it, etc.).
Stay home and do not leave your child or young child (under 5 years of age) in a shared room with other people (children under the age of 2 years).
Children and young adults should not be in any public or private spaces where they can be seen, heard, touched or otherwise touched. Children should remain 6 feet away from other children and adults, except for special occasions.Children under 6 years old should wear a light-coloured, non-porous, cloth face covering when outside."
" There is a lot of uncertainty about the path the virus will take. For example, the WHO has not yet published a complete list of countries affected by the novel coronavirus. WHO is working on a full-scale assessment of the situation, and will continue to update as new information becomes available.

However, it is important to keep in mind that the risk of a global pandemic is very small. It is therefore possible for a country to be hit hard, or at least badly, in the short term. This is particularly true in developing countries, where the number of confirmed cases is expected to drop. However, there are still many, many unknowns, including the extent to which countries will be able to adapt to the new virus and the ways in which they will deal with them. In addition, countries are also likely to face challenges in implementing effective measures to control the disease, such as social distancing, health-based quarantines and other measures that aim to slow or eliminate the epidemic. Governments and health authorities will have to work together to ensure the health and well-being of their populations, as well as the protection of vulnerable populations. Countries that are experiencing significant economic and social disruption will need to take decisive action to address the underlying causes of these disruptions, to reduce their reliance on imported goods and to develop effective ways of managing their own health systems.  


  The situation in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, has seen a significant drop in cases, with only a slight increase in hospitalizations and deaths.

[...] WHO [recommends that all countries reduce travel to and from the affected areas, isolate people and isolate health workers, [and] encourage people to self-isolate and travel only if they are in close contact with people who are sick with the illness. The WHO also recommends that governments [begin to use [emergency travel bans and/or travel restrictions] to prevent people from traveling to or from areas with high transmission rates, particularly in rural areas and in densely populated areas. These measures should be effective in preventing and responding to outbreaks, but they should also be consistent with international law and international humanitarian law. They should not be used as a means of coercion or coercion against people living in or visiting areas that have been targeted for international community response. Instead, these measures must be proportionate and are designed to protect the lives of those most at risk, rather than to impose unnecessary restrictions on people's access to health services or prevent them from engaging in activities that could seriously harm them or their loved ones. To date, no country has imposed a travel ban or travel restriction that significantly restricts travel within its own borders, despite the fact that some other countries have imposed similar measures in response to human rights violations or other international human-escalation measures. China has, however, implemented a blanket ban on all international flights and residents of China for 14 days, effectively ending the country's entire international travel policy, except for the People's Repatriation Act, which prohibits Chinese citizens and visitors from China and nationals of affected countries from entering or leaving China. While the restrictions remain in place, they may be suspended or revoked at any time, so long as they do not significantly interfere with China's internal and external security or law enforcement efforts to contain or halt the outbreak. Any restrictions imposed by a government on travel or on the movement of people outside its borders are not binding unless and until the government can demonstrate that it has the legal authority to suspend or revoke such restrictions. If the Chinese government does not comply with a ban imposed on its citizens or visitors, then the ban remains in force and can be enforced by force or threat of force, even if that ban is not enforced in whole or in part. There are no specific legal rights or obligations that would prevent a Chinese citizen or visitor from exercising their rights under the law to travel outside their country of nationality or to enter or leave China without a valid reason for doing so. A person who is unlawfully in China is presumed not to have a legitimate interest in entering, leaving or entering China at the time of"
" I'm not really sure what I want to do with my life right now. I don't have any money, I have no other income, and my only source of income is to buy food and shelter for my family. 

I am trying to find a job, but it's not easy because my employer is closing its doors and I can't find any work in the meantime. My only other option would be to go to a shelter in a country with no laws against forced evictions, or I could try selling my house for a fraction of what it would cost to rent in Germany. But I am worried that if I do that, my job prospects will be worse than that of my country of origin, because I will have to work from home for the next few months in order to pay my rent and cover the cost of food, shelter, medical care and other necessities that I need to cover in case I go back to the country where I started my business.

" There is currently no evidence to support the use of self-isolation in the context of COVID-19. However, there is a growing body of research that suggests that social distancing and isolation may be effective in reducing the spread of the virus. For example, a recent study found that people who were physically isolated during the pandemic were less likely to develop severe illness, and that isolation was associated with lower rates of hospitalization and death. Further research is needed to understand the long-term effects of isolation on the health and well-being of people living with HIV and other HIV-related chronic conditions.

In addition to physical isolation, people with underlying medical conditions should regularly clean their hands with soap and water and regularly cover their coughs and sneezes with a tissue or tissue bag. These actions may reduce the risk of infection and may help prevent future transmission. People should maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between themselves and others when they are not in isolation. This is especially important when people are in close contact with others who are at higher risk for infection, such as children and pregnant women. If people do not maintain this distance, they may become seriously ill and require hospital care. Regular hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene are also important. Follow the directions of your local health authority and local community health authorities on how to maintain good air quality in your home, workplace and community.

" The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly spread through contact with respiratory droplets produced when someone coughs or sneezes. It is most commonly spread by touching your face, nose or mouth, or through your clothing. The most effective ways to protect yourself and others from the virus are to regularly clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing. If you are not wearing a mask, use a tissue-based disposable mask that has a Velcro closure that clips to the front of the mask when the wearer is not in the public eye. You can also carry your mask with you when you leave the house, as long as you do not carry any personal items, such as cigarettes, alcohol or prescription painkillers. WHO has also published guidance on how to safely dispose of personal protective equipment (PPE) in public places, including at public health centres and health workers' stations. For more information, see How do I keep my mask and PPE away from others? How can I protect myself?

" There are many things you can do to reduce the risk of getting infected from Covid-19. First and foremost among these is to stay away from people who are coughing or sneezing. Secondly, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. This is especially important if you have a fever, cough or difficulty breathing. Thirdly, wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after using the bathroom and before eating or preparing food. And last but not least, be sure to cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you leave the house. If you are worried that you may be infected, seek medical attention immediately and inform your health care provider.

" Shorting stocks is a great way to diversify your portfolio, especially if you are looking to invest in stocks that are diversified enough to cover a broad range of economic and social  concerns.

Shorting is not a panacea, but it is an important part of any portfolio management strategy. It allows you to quickly and effectively buy and sell stocks without having to worry about the long-term effects of a stock's price crash. You can also use it to buy or sell index funds, which are essentially the same thing, except that you need to be able to sell them at a price that reflects your underlying economic concerns, rather than the underlying stock market. This is especially important when you want to make a lot of money in a short term investment, like in an index fund or mutual fund, where you can easily sell your index portfolio at an extremely low price without worrying about long term effects. In fact, many of the strategies you've described work well for small-cap stocks, as long as you're willing to put in the time and effort to research and develop new strategies that can be used to meet your specific economic needs.

" The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to regularly clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing. If you have fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority and local public health authorities, including Diagnostic and Treatment for People Living with HIV (PHIP). If you are not symptom-free, advice is available from local health authorities to help ensure that you are not at risk of developing a new illness if you develop symptoms. You should keep placeable items such as masks and gloves in your home, as well as medicines and hand hygiene that are easier for you and your family to maintain.
Stay home if you feel unwell and need to go to the emergency room, where you can be seen and cared for by a member of the public. This will help prevent you from contracting the virus and transmitting it to others. However, it is important to stay safe and talk with your health care provider about any changes to your routine and how they can help protect you.

  The best way to help is to talk to your neighbors and make sure they understand your concerns.  If you are worried about your neighbor’s health or safety, call in advance and explain that your concern is related to COVID-19 and that you would like to speak with a health care provider about the situation.

If you do not have health insurance, you can still get help from your state or local public health department. But you should be aware that some states and local governments are offering free or reduced-cost care to people who need it most. For more information, see State and Local Public Health Services for People Who Are Ill or Respiratory Distress: How Can I Help? and How to Talk to Your Health Care Provider about Illness and Illnesses in Your State or Local Community. You can find information about how to apply for Medicaid or the Medicare for All eligible People program at state.gov/guidance/about-immigrants-in-the- United States.


To help people in your community, talk with your insurance company to find out if you qualify for a tax credit or other tax relief. Some states have set up programs that help low-income people with medical expenses, such as the Low-Income Housing Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps people pay for food, housing, and other necessities. Other states, however, have not yet implemented any of these programs, so it is not possible to tell how much help you will get.

" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a page on testing for COVID-19.  

The CDC website states:


  Testing is performed under the supervision of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Infectious Disease Research and Development (OIDR).  The testing is conducted in accordance with the Public Health Service Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 C.F.R. Part 107), and is not for the purpose of diagnosing, treating, or preventing communicable disease. Testing should be performed in a manner that is safe and effective for all persons, including those with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, to ensure the safety and well-being of their health care provider and to minimize the possibility of transmission to others. For more information about testing, visit https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about-testing.html#prepare-for-use-of-tested-antibiotics.
However, it is important to note that the tests are not intended to diagnose or treat any specific disease or condition. Rather, they are to help protect Americans from the virus and help prevent future outbreaks. The CDC is working with state and local health departments to develop guidance and guidance for how to test and treat people who are currently or may be in the United States, as well as with other federal agencies. To learn more about how testing can be used, see Testing for 2019 Novel coronaviruses and Preparing for Use of Antibiotic-Contaminated Products  at CDC’s Information Center on Testing and Treatment for Novel Covirals and Preventing Illnesses. Learn about how to use testing kits for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), including properly known as Peracetic Acid Reactions (PAQs), Propermeable Acids or Acetylsalicylic Acid (PAAs) in combination with other commonly used N-95 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PCNABs) to treat common colds, such as influenza, acute respiratory distress syndrome (AERS) and acute rhinovirus (SARS).  Learn more about the use of fluoramphibitor-based antiretroviral therapy (fluoride therapy) in children and adolescents, including coughs and nasal swabs to help manage fever,” according to the American Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunologists recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).

" Yes, but only if you are showing symptoms of COVID-19.

If you have fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. Call in advance and ask to speak with a local health authority. Follow the advice of your local GP or local mental health services. You should talk to your healthcare provider about how you can continue to live with your illness and how your symptoms compare to those of other coronavirus patients. If you develop symptoms and need to be admitted to hospital, you should seek advice from a qualified health professional. However, it is important to ensure you do not have any contact with anyone who has died or is in a state of acute respiratory distress. To help protect yourself and others from the potential risk of infection, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has advised that all animals in the world should be kept as separate from humans as possible. For more information on how animals are managed and cared for, see https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronaviruse-2019/do-animals-need-to-be-kept-isolated-in-vivax-wild-cities.html#ixzz2hqhjhfqn
You should also regularly clean your hands with soap and water after handling animals, including your pet, and before eating or preparing food. This is particularly important when handling large numbers of pets, as they can be attracted to small animals and can transmit the virus to other animals. The World Health Organisation advises that people should maintain a distance of at least 1 metre (3 feet) between themselves and animals they are caring for. Pets should not be in any way touched or carried around by people other than their owner, unless they have been quarantined by the IPC or the Food Standards Agency (FSA). This includes people who are regularly washing their hands and are not touching their eyes, nose, mouth or other areas of the body. These are important considerations when it comes to keeping animals healthy and well fed. Please refer to the WHO’s guidance on handling and maintaining healthy pets and ensure they meet the following standards:  
Do not touch or carry animals that have died of natural causes, such as cats, dogs, horses, lambs, pigs, chickens, pig or piglets, wild animals or wild birds. Do not carry any animal that has been imported from outside the Schengen area into the United Kingdom, except for veterinary care or as directed by a veterinarian.


This is a general advice and does not apply to pets or pets of anyone living with you. It is not intended to prevent you from travelling to another country or country where you may be ill or unable to care for a pet or animal.  If your health condition worsens or becomes seriously unwell, contact your veterinarian to discuss your concerns with them and advise them of possible treatment options and possible reintroduction of animals to a safer and more secure place.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" Yes, but only if they have been in contact with someone who has both. 

If you have a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. If you are unable to go to the doctor, call your local hospital and ask them to direct you to a doctor who will be there 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to help you with any questions you may have. You should also call the local health authority to make arrangements for a stay at a hospital if you need to stay longer than 14 days.

" I am a Chinese citizen who has applied for a residence permit in the US. I have been to China twice already, both times for my PhD thesis. Both times I was denied entry because of the Coronavirus.

The first time was in March, when my visa expired. The second time expired in mid-April. My visa was renewed on April 1st, and I applied again on March 11th. This time, my application was rejected, as I did not meet the requirements of my current visa. However, due to the corona virus (which is a new virus) and the fact that I do not have a doctorate in Chinese medicine, it is not possible to continue my studies in China without a visa, even if I had a good reason to do so. So, in order to get a permanent US residency permit I need to apply again in April, but this time I will have to wait until April 2nd, at which point I would be allowed to return to my home country (China) to begin my research in medicine (I have already started my first Chinese PhD project there, which is already in progress).  I hope that this will be the case for me, since I already have Chinese residency permits in both countries, so I don't have any worries about this happening again. But, if this happens, would it be a huge mistake to extend my stay here for another year, or even a year at all?  If so, how would this affect my future studies, given the current situation? Also, is there any way to make sure that my family members can continue their studies at home, without having to worry about the possibility of going back to their country of origin (i.e. China)?  Or is it better to postpone the application at this point and wait for the Chinese government to give me the green light to move to another country? I think that the latter is the best option, because it allows me to stay longer and to avoid the risk of getting a negative response from my Chinese neighbors, who are more concerned about my situation than the negative reactions from their neighbors. If this were to happen, why would I wait so long for an official invitation to come from China, rather than waiting for it to be granted by the government? Is there anything I can do to help alleviate this situation, e.g. by postponing my applications at the same time or by canceling my visits to other countries? Or, should I try to contact the embassy or consulate in Beijing, to see if they are willing to provide me with some kind of help? If not, what are the steps I should take to minimize the impact of this decision? Do any of you have suggestions or suggestions for how to improve the situation in your country, especially if you are Chinese citizens or residents of China? Thank you in advance!  

 
Thank you very much for your kind words and suggestions!

" There is no evidence that the coronavirus can be transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets generated by coughing or sneezing. However, it is possible that a person can contract the virus from a contaminated surface, such as a surface that has been cleaned and disinfected, by someone who has not been exposed to it. The risk of transmission is low, but there are some signs that people with mild symptoms may be at higher risk for developing severe illness.

" I am looking for a way to continue my studies in the field of epidemiology and bioinformatics. 

My advisor is a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of New South Wales. She is currently working on a PhD thesis on the evolution of coronaviruses. Her research interests are:


Characterizing the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and its associated viruses.
Studying the molecular mechanism of viral RNA polymerase activity in order to understand how the virus is distributed throughout the host cell. Drawing on molecular biology and virology, she is also interested in understanding the interaction between the viral genome and host immune responses. In this field she has a Ph.D. in biophysics from the Australian National University, and an M.Sc.inorganic Chemistry from Imperial College London. Currently working as a postdoc on an open access research project involving the identification of novel viral poly(A) tail nucleases and their interaction with host proteins. This research is funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).
Writing papers for journals and journals with peer-reviewed research resources.



   I would like to start my PhD with a solid foundation of basic research skills, such as basic understanding of protein folding, protein kinetics, structural biology, immunobiology, proteomic analysis and proteomics, as well as some basic knowledge of virus structure and function, e.g. how to model the structure of viruses in a manner that is consistent across multiple host species. Ideally, my thesis would focus on understanding how viruses are distributed and how they can be modulated in response to environmental factors, including temperature, humidity, air pressure, sunlight, temperature and temperature-induced changes in virus particle size and shape. However, this requires a lot of research experience, so I want to be able to apply this knowledge to a wide range of areas, i.e. from biological systems biology to medicine and medicine research. If this is not possible, then I will need to find a more flexible and flexible approach to applying my current knowledge in these areas. For example, if my research area is in proteome biology or protein structure analysis, it may be best to consider applying this to other areas of your field. Alternatively, you may consider pursuing an in-person or online research position, where you can apply the knowledge you already have gained in this area to your own research, to help your advisor with your research goals and/or to assist in developing your thesis. Either of these options are highly desirable, but you should consider the pros and cons of each option, especially if you are considering a position that requires you to work from home, or are based in an area where the availability of remote research assistants may limit your ability to effectively communicate with the wider scientific community. Finally, the current pandemic is unpredictable and will affect the way the world is being prepared for it. So it is important that you take the time to think through your options carefully and critically, before deciding whether or not to pursue this position. You may find that the options you have presented are appealing, particularly if they involve you working remotely or at a research facility where there is no available access to researchers or researchers' assistants. But if the situation is chaotic and you do not have the flexibility to travel to remote locations, consider making the choice between pursuing this or pursuing a similar position in another field or, more likely, pursuing the same position at another institution, depending on your personal circumstances and your academic interests. As always, please feel free to contact me via e-mails, in person or via video chats, via Twitter or through the comments section of my blog, etc. Thank you in advance for your understanding and I look forward to hearing from you!

" There are a number of things you can do to help protect yourself and others against COVID-19. First and foremost among these is to regularly clean your hands with soap and water. Secondly, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. If you have fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately. Follow the directions of your local health authority and local authorities to ensure that you are not touching any objects or objects that may be on your person, including your desk, countertops, tables, lamps, light switches, and other light sources. You can find more information on how to safely dispose of household items in your area here. Finally, keep up to date on the latest coronavirus threats by following CDC’s travel advisories and visas for people who are currently in or have recently returned from the affected area.
Stay safe and stay home if you or someone you care for is seriously ill. Talk to your healthcare provider about any concerns you may have about how your health is being managed and how you and your loved one are being cared for. If you feel unwell, call in advance to report your symptoms and ensure you do not come into contact with anyone who is not in good health.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" The Corona virus is a new virus that has not been previously identified in humans. It is thought to be a result of mutations in the RNA of the coronavirus genome, which means it is not yet known whether this mutation is present in human cells. However, the virus has been shown to cause a range of respiratory symptoms including fever, cough and shortness of breath. These symptoms are most commonly caused by respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also cause respiratory infections such as pneumonia and meningitis. In addition, it can cause serious illness in children and adults, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and acute myelogenous encephalomyelitis (AMS). CDC recommends that all people aged under 5 years, regardless of age, be encouraged to regularly clean their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before and after touching their face, mouth or eyes. Children should wear a mask if they are in close contact with someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. Children should also wear cloth face coverings when walking or running, as recommended by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Children under the age of 1 year and children of all ages with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of developing severe illness and death from the disease.

" Cuomo's comments come amid a growing number of reports of coronavirus testing at public health facilities across the country. Cuomo has also criticized the federal government for not doing enough to protect Americans from the virus. In a recent interview with Fox News, he said that ""it’s not a good idea to test people who are sick,” adding that it is ""absolutely necessary"" for health care workers to be on the front lines of preventing the spread of the disease.


In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a list of tests it tests for every infectious disease, and it does this by asking people to self-isolate for 14 days. The tests are not mandatory, but they are a way to see if people are at higher risk of developing a more severe infection.  The CDC says that if you have a fever, cough, or shortness of breath, it means that you should stay home and not go to the doctor. If you do have symptoms, seek medical attention and call in advance to report the situation to your state health department, which will then make sure that your symptoms don't lead to you getting tested. But it's important to note that there is no federal mandate for testing, so you can't order it from a doctor without first consulting with an outside health professional. You can, however, request that a test be performed at your local hospital, where it can be done in a matter of days, as long as the request is in writing and is accompanied by a signed declaration that states that the test is not for the purpose of diagnosing or treating a specific illness. It's not yet clear if this is the same as asking a stranger to stay at a hospital for a few days for an exam or a blood test, although it seems likely that this would be the case for most cases, especially if the stranger is an older person or someone who has been in close contact with someone with a known or suspected illness, such as a family member or close relative who is currently experiencing a severe illness or is at high risk for serious illness (e.g., HIV, diabetes, cancer, HIV-1, stroke, etc.).  In addition, some states have passed laws that require that people with suspected or confirmed illnesses be hospitalized, even if they have no symptoms at all, to help them manage their illness and avoid spreading the illness to others. For more information on how to ask for and obtain tests, see this CDC web page.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|e

" The best way to protect yourself and your loved ones is to practice good respiratory hygiene.  If you’re sick, stay home, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. Follow the directions of your local health department. If you have symptoms, seek medical attention and call in advance. You can also talk to your health care provider about ways you can reduce the risk of developing symptoms and help manage your anxiety and loss of control. Stay home if you feel unwell.

" The answer is a lot of different things, but the basic idea is this:


The debt is the sum of the obligations of all parties to the contract. The obligations are the total amount of money that the parties have agreed to pay each other in the event of a default on their obligations. If a party defaults on its obligations, it will have no more money than it actually has right now, so it can't do anything about the debt at all. So it has to sell all the assets on the market, which means selling everything at a loss. This is what the Eurozone is all about: selling assets to make money for the people who are most in need, while also keeping the costs of maintaining the currency artificially low.  This strategy is called ""quantitative easing"", and it's basically a way to artificially lower the interest rates on debt so that people can pay their debts without having to worry about inflation. Basically, the goal is to prop up the financial system by artificially lowering the cost of paying people's debts, thus making the economy more or less self-sufficient, in order to keep the money flowing in and out of productive activity. In other words, if the Fed wanted to go quantitative easing, they would probably have to do it in a deflationary way, where the dollar is essentially worthless, meaning that it would be extremely hard to get any kind of inflationary stimulus package passed, even if it were to be accompanied by a strong economic contraction. That is, unless, of course, there was some sort of global economic crisis that caused the central bank to intervene in some way (e.g. a global financial meltdown, for example), which it probably would not have done, given the relative lack of political will and control over monetary policy at that time. (Note: I'm not suggesting that this is necessarily a bad thing, just that there are some things that are not as clear-cut as the current state of affairs.)
So, to summarize, Japan's current situation is very different from that of most European countries, except that they have a relatively small debt burden compared to most Asian countries. They have relatively low unemployment, relatively high disposable income, low inflation and relatively little debt to spend on things like healthcare, education, social services and other basic needs, despite the fact that their economy is still very much in shambles, with a population of just under 1.5 billion people, according to data from the World Bank. Their unemployment rate is actually down slightly from their peak of over 30% in 2007, when they were the only major economy in Asia to experience a significant decline in unemployment rates, though that was due to a combination of economic factors and the government's reluctance to bail out the big banks that had been bailed out by the previous government, making it easier for them to refinance their debt into something that would actually be worth the riskier investment, rather than the more risky investment that many Asian economies have become in recent years, such as Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong (note: the latter two countries are now in lockdown mode). 
Japan's situation isn't entirely unique to Asia, either, as other countries have also experienced similar problems with their own economies. For example, Italy and Spain, both of which suffered from severe economic and social damage during the 2007-2009 financial crisis (Italy was forced to close its entire banking system in 2008), have seen their economies go through similar periods of crisis. Italy's economy has grown by more than 20% since the end of 2008, thanks in large part to government stimulus packages and a raft of other measures, including the creation of an emergency fund to help pay for public services, a massive public-health system and, most recently, an unprecedented number of social-distancing measures. Spain has also seen its economy grow by an average of 7.4% during this period, compared with just 0.6% for Italy, although that's partly because the country has taken a much more radical approach to social distancing, by requiring people to stay at least 6 feet away from others for 14 days a week, up from just 2 feet in Italy. And while Italy has seen a large increase in cases of COVID-19, their overall health situation has been much worse than their country's overall economic situation, due largely to relatively lax measures to control the virus, particularly the use of hand sanitizer and lax enforcement of health-related"
" People who are currently or have recently moved to a new place of residence are more likely to be at increased risk of severe illness, such as heart disease, lung disease and cancer. However, there is no evidence to suggest that people living in households with more than one other person will be more or less at risk. This is particularly true for people with underlying medical conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and high blood pressure. People living with HIV and those with other HIV-related chronic conditions should continue to practice good respiratory hygiene and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from others. For people who have been to and remain in close contact with infected people, it is important to wash hands frequently with soap and water and to cover their coughs and sneezes with an alcohol-based hand rub.

" I am a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I have been working on a novel coronavirus vaccine for the COVID-19 pandemic. The vaccine is being developed under the guidance of the UK government.

I am looking for a vaccine candidate that can be used in a clinical setting to treat patients with COV-2. Currently, there is a shortage of vaccine candidates. What can I do to help my university in this situation? I would like to know if there are any universities in Canada or the United States that are willing to work with me on vaccine development, and if so, what are the steps I can take to ensure that they are doing their part in helping me develop the vaccine? If not, how would it be possible for me to continue my studies at a university that is not on the list of universities that would be interested in supporting me in developing my vaccine, given the lack of funding for such a large research project? Do I need to contact the university to find out if this is the case, or is it best to wait for them to provide me with the funding to begin the research phase?

  What is the current status of testing in China?   The current situation is that testing is being conducted in a number of countries around the world, including China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, Japan, Singapore, and the US.  However, there is no official way of knowing whether or not testing will continue in all of these countries, or whether it will be expanded to other countries. Testing is still needed in some parts of Asia, particularly China. China is currently testing people in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Yunnan Province and Huanan City, as well as people living in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Nanjing and Nanning City. It is not yet known whether these tests will remain in use in these cities, but it seems likely that they will. In addition, some countries are allowing people to stay in quarantine for 14 days after they have tested positive, although this may not be sufficient to prevent the virus from spreading further into the population. Some countries have also banned people from traveling to areas with high transmission rates, which may increase the risk of infection. WHO is assessing ongoing research on how to best use existing screening measures in countries where testing may be needed. For more information on testing, see WHO’s Guidance for People Living with HIV and Testing for Coronaviruses: Guidance on How to Use Standardized Screening Infectious Disease Screening (SDS-CoV) in Countries With High Preliminary Reports of Human-to-Human Transmission  (HIV) (World Health Organization).  WHO has also issued guidance for people with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCov infection to follow CDC recommended measures for self-quarantine and isolation in high-risk areas.

" WHO has advised against the use of hand sanitizer in general and hand washing in particular. However, it is not recommended to use soap and water for at least 20 seconds after application of the cleanser.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has a page on hand hygiene: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/hand-washing-recommended-for-all-countries/guidance-against-the-outbreak-of-colon- 2019-nCoV, which states:


  Handwashing is recommended for all people living with, or caring for, HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and related conditions. It is important to wash your hands frequently, especially if you are coughing or sneezing, and to cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough, sneeze or feel unwell. If soap or water are not readily available, use alcohol-based hand rub or a hand disinfectant (e.g., Ethyl alcohol, Sodium hypochlorite or Sodium oxyxychloroquine) to disinfect contaminated surfaces such as tables, counters, countertops, lamps, light switches and other electrical outlets. 
People with underlying medical conditions should avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth, as they are at higher risk for eye and respiratory infections. People with suspected or confirmed 2019 novel coronaviruses should wash their hands before, during and after their visit to the doctor or other medical facility, to ensure they do not transmit the virus to others. For more information on how to safely and effectively use handwashing, see Handwashing and hand hygiene from the WHO’s Managing and Coordinating Public Health Organisations onhandwashing and disinfection of surfaces and objects in the public health and non-proliferation of infectious diseases and their prevention and control. WHO is working with partners to develop guidance and action plans for countries and territories that are taking steps to protect themselves and the health of their people from the threat posed by the new virus.

" The most common symptoms are fever, tiredness, and shortness of breath. Some people also have feverish-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, cough, or difficulty breathing. These symptoms usually begin within a few days of exposure to the virus, but can last for weeks or even months.

People can also catch COVID-19 from others who are infected with the same virus. For example, if someone is coughing or sneezing frequently, they may be coughing because they are trying to get some air into their lungs. Other people may have similar symptoms (e.g., someone with a sore throat, for example), but the exact cause of their symptoms is still unclear.


What is the most important thing you can do to protect yourself and others from catching the new virus?

" Yes, you should. Pet testing is a good way to protect yourself and your pet from the virus.

If you have a confirmed or suspected case of coronavirus infection, your vet or other appropriate health care provider will be able to provide you with a test kit and instructions for how to safely and effectively use the kit.  If you are not sure whether your dog or cat is at higher risk of catching the disease, the best thing you can do is call your local veterinary clinic and ask them if they are open 24/7 to discuss your concerns. If they do not have an open clinic, they may be willing to give you a chance to self-quarantine, or at the very least, let you know that you will not be allowed to go outside for a few days at a time (this is the case with my dog).  This is especially important for people who are immunocompromised and who would like to remain in close contact with their pets, so that they can continue to care for them and keep them healthy. You should also be aware that any pet you adopt should be given the same care and attention as your healthy dog and cat, as well as a regular supply of veterinary care, to ensure that their health is maintained. This includes regular check-ups with your veterinarian and regular visits to the vets' office, where they will regularly check on your health and wellbeing. It is important to note that if you decide to adopt a pet for adoption, it is strongly discouraged to do so in a way that does not interfere with the wellbeing of the pet or the health or well-being of your adoptee. However, if your adopted pet is not healthy enough to be adopted by a reputable pet rescue or adoption agency, and you wish to continue your adoptions as soon as possible, there is no reason to believe that it would be in your best interest to end your adoption at this stage.

" Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly how long the virus can survive on surfaces, and how much it needs to be destroyed before it can spread to other people.

But scientists say that the best way to know for sure is to look at the numbers of new cases every day.  That means looking at how many people have died from the disease so far and then comparing those numbers to the number of cases that have been diagnosed, to see if there are differences in the amount of time that a new infection can take to take hold in a population.


The CDC says that it is not yet possible to determine the exact length and severity of the coronavirus, but it does suggest that people should take precautions to avoid touching or touching their eyes, nose, mouth or eyes when they are sick, as well as to wash their hands often with soap and water.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" There’s a lot of uncertainty about what will happen in the short term. But for now, it seems likely that the federal government will allow businesses to close. And schools and universities will continue to operate.

But businesses will still need to provide essential services, such as cleaning, disinfecting, and maintaining the bathrooms and changing rooms. Some will also be able to hire workers, but most will be in temporary or part-time jobs, meaning they will have to stay home for the duration of the shutdown. Those workers are likely to be mostly young people, many of them from low-wage industries, who have little or no experience in caring for elderly or disabled people. Many of those workers may be unemployed or underemployed, so they may have no other choice but to leave the economy.  
 And businesses that rely on temporary workers will likely be hit hard. The Department of Labor has estimated that it will take at least a year to fill all the positions at a factory in a state that has closed its doors. That will put it at risk of layoffs and job losses, as well as the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal stimulus payments to states that have closed their doors, according to a March report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR).  The [Federal Reserve] has also said it expects the unemployment rate to rise to 8.5 percent by mid-April, which would be the highest since the 1960s, when President Bill Clinton announced that he would end the federally guaranteed unemployment insurance program, or Jobless Retirement Security Program, to help people who are out of work and looking for work. [The Federal Reserve is also set to announce a $500 billion stimulus package for small businesses](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/business/coronavirus-stimulus.html) and [start-up-startups will receive a stimulus check. Companies will get a tax credit of up to $250 per gigabyte of capital investment, with the goal of increasing the amount of money that can be used to pay payroll and other payroll expenses.] 


And here are some other things to keep in mind about the current situation:  If you are a small business owner, you may want to consider whether you can keep your business online, even if you don't have a bank account. You can do this by going to your local bank or credit card provider and asking for a loan to cover the costs of paying your mortgage, paying the rent, getting a car payment, moving your family to another state or country, etc. If the cost of maintaining a business is too much, there are other ways to reduce your expenses. For example, if the business you're trying to get started on is no longer operating or you have other financial problems that require you to cut costs, consider using a savings account or checking your account balance regularly to make sure you aren't overdrafting or misattributing any of your money to other people's accounts. This will help you avoid situations like this, where you end up with a large balance that is not being used for other purposes, e.g. as a way to save money on a rainy day or to avoid paying rent or paying other expenses that you would otherwise have taken out on your own. It also helps to have some sort of check payable to you on the balance, in case you feel like you owe more than you actually owe, because you didn't pay the interest on that check when it was due. (If you do decide to take out a check, be sure to include the check amount in your check and include any interest you might have accrued over the past year or so.)  But it's also a good idea to check that your balance is still reasonably close to what you paid it for, whether that's because of a change in circumstances or because your credit is significantly better than your actual monthly payments. In the long run, this will save you money, too, since you'll have less debt to spend on things like buying a house or saving for retirement, rather than having to worry about paying more for things that are actually worth less than they would have been if they hadn't been so expensive to begin with. Even if your income is below the poverty line, that doesn't mean you should be worried about losing your job or your home. Instead, think about how your situation will affect your ability to find a job and pay for your education or other important expenses, both of which you could have saved by taking advantage of some form of government assistance. So, keep an eye out for any changes that might make your life easier or less difficult for you, especially if those changes are not as drastic as some might suggest.

If you do not qualify for refund, the government will refund the money to you in the form of a “Tax” on your taxable year beginning after December 31, 2020. The refund will be based on the amount of the refundable tax credit you’re entitled to receive, plus any additional taxes you may have imposed on that credit during the calendar year in which you filed your Form I-94, or your adjusted gross income tax liability for that year, whichever is later. For example, if you file your tax return on or after January 1, 2021, your refund amount is $953,000, which is equal to $1,079,200 in 2019 and $2,971,800 in 2020, but you did not file it until after the end of your first year of tax filer status (i.e., beginning of 2020), and you had not filed it before your last tax filing date, then you would have received the tax refund at the time of filing your return, even if your current tax status is no longer valid. This is especially important for people who have been claimed as dependent on a foreign country for tax purposes for at least 14 days prior to their return filing, as this will allow them to avoid paying taxes on their current taxes. However, it is important to note that this is not the same as a tax deduction for state and local taxes, since this does not apply to income received from an organization that is exempt from the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (section 401(g)(2)(B)(i)(II)(C) or section 505(a)(1)(D)(iv)(3) if the organization is a nonresident alien corporation (as defined in section 2(c)(4) of this Act).  
The reason for this deduction is that the IRS has determined that a taxpayer who filed his or her return before the date on which the return was filed is eligible for an exemption from income taxes for up to 90 days. If the taxpayer was not claimed for any reason other than due to a bona fide need for leave to care for a dependent child or child care provider, he or she may still be subject to an additional 90-day extension of stay for purposes of complying with the rules of subsection (e)(5)(A)(ii)(I), provided that such extension is in addition to any other non-frivolous stay authorized by the Secretary of State (or any successor to such stay) under this subsection. In addition, any such Extension of Stay may be conditioned on compliance with any applicable state or local law or regulation, including any regulations promulgated under chapter 11 of title 5, United States Code (article II, cl. 1), or any order of any court of competent jurisdiction, in order to continue to file a return or to pay any portion of an amount due under such title, except as provided in paragraph (1) (relating to nonrefundable portion thereof), if such return is filed in a timely manner and is timely filed and has not otherwise been materially delayed or canceled by reason of such timely filing (other than for nonpayment of taxes due on income or property received before such filing is deemed to be inadmissible as income under section 151(h)(9)). 



  In general, an alien who is claimed under the Family and Medical Leave Act (5 U.S.C. 1181 et seq.), as amended by section 1202(b)(6), shall be treated as having filed for such period of leave with respect to which such alien was claimed in accordance with this section, unless the alien is otherwise exempted from such exemption. See section 5.2 of Pub. L. 107–261, set out as an Effective Date of 2003 Amendment note below:  Sec. 12. (a) The Secretary shall establish procedures to ensure that aliens who are claimed by a spouse or common-law partner in an application for or re-applicable stay of more than 60 days are not denied the application and are allowed to reapply for and receive a new application at any time after such application is adjudicated not to have expired. Such procedures shall include a process for expedited processing of applications"

" I am a PhD student in epidemiology at the University of Waterloo, Canada. My advisor has been very supportive of my thesis. She has advised me that I should contact the university to ask for a grant to cover the costs of the research, but I have not heard back from them yet.  I would like to contact them to see if they would be willing to provide me with some flexibility in the funding model, or if I could just use the grant money as a starting point for the next round of research. Is there anything I can do to help her with this?  If so, how would it be possible to make this a reality? If not, what would help me most? Thanks in advance!  Also, if you have any suggestions or suggestions for how to improve this, please feel free to drop me a line at [email protected] and I'll do my best to answer as quickly as possible. Thanks!
Edit: I just want to point out that my advisor is not a professor, so I'm not really asking for anything more than a quick grant. Her advice is that she is aware that there are some things that need to be done to address the issue of funding for epidemiological research in Canada:


Create a fund for research that is targeted towards those who are most at risk of dying from COVID-19. This fund should be used to:
Provide funding to researchers who have the capacity to pay for their own medical care and to support their family in case of an unexpected need for care. For example, a family member who is seriously ill should receive care from a health care provider who can provide care to them while they are in need of care (e.g. a ventilator, dialysis machine, etc.).
Require that research funding be prioritized over other areas, such as research related to prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, which is why it is important to prioritize research on prevention, rather than treatment related diseases. These are important areas for which the federal government is actively engaged, as well as areas that are not yet fully covered by the current federal funding rules. Funding for these areas will be subject to rigorous peer review and, in some cases, approval from the relevant government bodies. In addition, the government will continue to ensure that funding is used appropriately and effectively, including in areas where the need is most acute. To date, there is no evidence that Canada's current funding levels are sufficient to meet the needs of all Canadians living with or caring for an underlying medical condition. Therefore, funding must be provided in accordance with the Public Health Service Act and other relevant federal and provincial laws, to enable research to proceed as planned, without undue burden on patients or their carer(s).
This funding will also be available to eligible research institutions that have demonstrated that their research is of high quality and that it can be sustained in part or in whole in an efficient and cost-effective manner. As a result, eligible institutions will receive a percentage of their operating costs from their general fund, up to and including the cost of maintaining and expanding the program. If the eligible institution is unable to maintain or expand its program, then it will have no financial incentive to do so. However, this will not prevent it from being able to continue, at some point, with its existing research program (i.e., if it were to close, for reasons other than to reduce the number of patients it could care for). 
The funding mechanism for this research will depend on how"
" 
  What is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19?


Stay home if you or someone you care for coughs or sneezes. Follow the directions of your local health authority. If you have symptoms, seek medical attention and call in advance.
If you are worried about your child or child's health, talk to them about the risks and how they can take action to reduce the risk of developing a more severe illness.

" The bill includes a provision that would allow colleges and universities to offer loans to students who have been in the US for at least 14 days.  This is a significant change from the current rules, which allow students to take advantage of the loan forgiveness if they’re unable to work due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

However, it does not provide any guidance on how to apply for loans, and it is unclear how students can get a loan without the assistance of a college or university, or whether loans can be used to pay for college expenses, such as transportation, food, medical expenses or other expenses incurred during the 14-day period preceding the application. It does, however, provide that students with pre-existing medical conditions or disabilities can receive loans under the Pell Grants program, a program that provides financial aid to low-income families.


The bill also includes an additional $500 million to help states and localities with disaster relief and recovery efforts, as well as grants to nonprofits and non-profits that help people recover from or prevent disasters. The money will go to states that have already received grants, but have not yet received funding, like New York, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Carolina or West Virginia. In addition, the money is being used for grants for research, education, research and outreach, to support health care and other critical infrastructure, including roads, hospitals, schools, transportation systems, public health and disaster response, law enforcement and corrections, disaster management and response resources, child care, mental health services and substance abuse prevention and treatment services, community outreach and peer learning programs, job training and training for people with disabilities and people living with HIV and HIV-related disabilities, unemployment insurance, student loan borrowers, survivors of domestic violence or abuse and those who are in need of assistance in finding and paying for their own rent, mortgage, car payments or child support, among other things.

Senate Democrats on Wednesday introduced a bill to extend unemployment benefits for up to six months for the first time since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. [...] The measure, Senate Democrats said, would help the unemployed and underemployed, people without dependents, those with incomes under $75,000 or those without a Social Security number. Those benefits would be available to anyone who has lost his or her job for more than 30 days or has been found to have a medical condition that causes permanent disability or is otherwise undiagnosed. Under the plan, eligible workers would have to file their taxes and pay into the system within 60 days of their unemployment, whichever comes first. If they do not file, they would not be able to receive the benefit until they reach their 60th day of unemployment. They would still be entitled to unemployment checks and a $2,500 check for every $1 spent on food and medical care. A person who is eligible for unemployment but is not looking for a job can still get it through the Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which provides a monthly payment of $5,200 to every worker who reaches 60 years of age or less. This payment is intended to provide a means of payment to people who need assistance, not just to keep them jobless. For more information about how SSI payments are calculated, see this link: http://cms.ucsf.edu/sites/default/files/cmsdocs/covid19-federal-statement-of-under-funding-for-the-unemployed.pdf
Republicans have said they will try to pass the measure by the end of March. But that timeline is subject to change, so check back with your state or local officials as soon as they have the chance to make a decision on whether to proceed with a measure they consider to be in their best interest.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" What is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from COVID-19? How can I protect myself and my family from the virus that has infected more than 1 in every 5 people in our country? WHO has developed a range of strategies to help people protect themselves and protect others. These include:Stay home if you or someone you care for is sick.Talk to your healthcare provider about any symptoms or concerns.Call in advance to arrange a stay-at-home visit.If you are worried about your child or loved one, seek medical advice from your local GP or other health authorities.Stayhome should only be used to:Help people who are in close contact with someone who has been seriously ill or who is in a state of high risk of serious illness or death.For people living with HIV, there is evidence that:Regularly taking medicines and taking antiretrovirals (such as chloroquine) is strongly recommended.Taking ibuprofen (Advil, Zydus or Zoloft) and other medicines that cause side effects, such as diuretics and antacid medicines, are strongly discouraged.People with underlying medical conditions should take their medicines regularly, especially if they have:Severe respiratory problems (e.g., pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome,"
" If you are sick with COVID-19, you should talk with your healthcare provider about how to care for your loved one.

If you have symptoms, such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. Call in advance and ask about what is going on. Follow the directions of your local health authority, including any restrictions on travel, movement or gatherings. If possible, wash your hands with soap and water before and after handling the sick person, and cover your cough and sneeze with a tissue or tissue wrapped around your elbow or hand when you cough. You can also take extra precautions to help protect yourself and others from the virus.

" There is no evidence to suggest that the coronavirus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets. However, the virus can be aerosolized through aerosols generated by a person coughing or sneezing. This is why it is important to maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who has been exposed to COVID-19. If you are not wearing a mask, you should not touch your face, nose or mouth with your hands, as this could expose you to potentially harmful viruses such as the SARS-CoV-2 and the common cold.

" Yes, but it’s important to remember that grocery shopping is not a substitute for regular physical activity.  If you are concerned about the risk of catching COVID-19 from your food, you should always wash your hands with soap and water before and after eating, and avoid touching your face, nose or mouth with your bent elbow or tissue when you shop. You can also use a tissue to hold your groceries in, or wrap your shopping bag around your neck, to help keep it from getting in the way of your daily routine.
If you have a fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Call your health care provider right away if you feel unwell and need to go to the hospital. Follow the directions of local health authorities and local public health officials on how to stay safe while you're away from the store and at home, including Do Not Disturb Information for People Living with HIV and Stay At Home if You Have Acute Respiratory Distress (SARS-CoV-2) (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/shelter-in-home-guidance-for-people-living-with-high-risk-covid19-types-and-how-to-help-protect-yourself/community-health-officials-advice/stay-safe-while-you-are- away-from-the-store).

" Yes, it is possible. But it's not as easy as it sounds. 

The best way to get around the restrictions is to stay in the same place as everyone else, and avoid social distancing. You can do this by staying at a hostel, or by going to a park or hiking trail. If you can't go to the park, there are plenty of places to go, including museums, libraries, cinemas, theatres, restaurants, bars, ski resorts, hiking trails, etc. There are also free Wi-Fi and internet access, so you won't have to worry about being out of the country for a few days. And if you do decide to travel, you should do so in a way that minimises the risk of catching COVID-19 from people who are not in close contact with you.


If you are planning on staying in one of these places, make sure you have at least two things in mind:
You want to avoid public gatherings and gatherings of more than 10 people. This means that you will not be able to meet people from all over the world. Therefore, avoid any sort of gatherings that are likely to cause problems for you, such as parties, sporting events, funerals, mass gatherings, religious services, sports competitions, political demonstrations, cultural events and religious gatherings.
Also, be sure to cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or tissue when you go out, as this will make it easier for the virus to pass between your hands and into your eyes and nose. Avoid touching your face with a tissue or object that has been soaked in water or other harmful substances, for example, a cloth or paper towel, which can irritate the eyes, nose or mouth. Don't touch any objects or surfaces that have been touched by someone who is coughing or sneezing, especially if they have recently been sick with coronavirus.

For the purposes of this guidance, the term “public” means any place where people gather, engage in or otherwise interact with one another. It does not mean that there is a public health crisis, like a pandemic, that requires a lockdown, e.g. a flu or the flu season. However, people need to be aware of their surroundings and the risks they are taking. They should also keep informed about the local health authorities and local authorities' actions to reduce the spread of coronovirus and ensure they follow the advice of those authorities. In addition, stay safe when travelling by car, bus, train or public transport. Keep up to date with the latest news and updates on the situation in your area by following the links provided by the relevant authorities to their websites and by using the contact form on their website to request information about upcoming travel advisories or to make arrangements for future travel.

" You can get a check for $1,200 for every $100 of income over $75,000.  If you have no children, you can still get the check, but you will need to file your taxes by the end of April.

The IRS has a page on filing eligibility for the stimulus check. It lists the steps you must take to get your check:


Pay your rent, purchase a home, buy a new car, pay your medical expenses, and make payments on your mortgage or other non-mortgage debt. You must also file Form I-539, which is required by law to be self-filed and must be filed within 90 days of the payment date of your loan. If your payment is due within 30 days after the due date, file it with your state or local income tax authority. The application fee is waived if you file within the 90-day period provided by your local or state government, whichever is later.



  
  The filing deadline is April 15, 2020, unless the Secretary of State issues a notice of change of address or changes to your tax filer status within 60 days from the date you filed your return. For more information about filing, see How do I file my taxes?
If you do not have a Social Security Number or a W-2, the IRS will not allow you to withdraw money from your account until you are no longer required to do so by a timely filed return, provided that you meet the following conditions:

" I have a question about the COVID-19 pandemic. I live in Germany. My wife has been infected with the virus for 14 days. She is recovering at home. Is there any way I can help her with her medical needs?  I would like to know if there is a way to make sure that my wife is well and doesn't end up in a hospital for the duration of her illness. If so, what should I do? I don't want to give her the impression that she is ill and needs to be cared for by a doctor or other health care provider, and I want her to feel safe and secure in her own home, without any contact with anyone who might be ill. Should I make her feel like she has no other choice than to stay home and not go to the doctor?
I am not asking about whether there should be some form of ""self-quarantine"" for her, or whether it is possible to get a medical certificate from the local health authority that says that her symptoms are not a sign of illness and should not be treated as such. It is also not clear what kind of measures would be appropriate to take to prevent her from getting infected again, given the fact that the situation is unpredictable and the number of cases in our country is increasing. What is clear is that we need to work together to ensure that everyone has access to safe, legal and legal means of getting into and out of our homes, including social distancing and other measures that are necessary to protect our health and safety. We can't just sit back and wait for a few weeks and say ""this is all over"", and expect that things will go back to normal as soon as things settle down. There is no ""magic bullet"" that will solve all of this, it will take time, effort and a lot of hard work. But there are things we can do to try and slow the epidemic down and prevent it from spreading further. For example, the government has set up a taskforce to look at ways to reduce the amount of time people spend outside their homes and how they can be more physically and mentally active. They are also encouraging people to wear masks and wear a face mask if they are in public, to help stop people from touching their eyes, nose or mouth. These measures are being taken because the risk of spreading the disease is very low, so it makes sense to use them as a last-resort measure, rather than trying to keep everyone else at arm's length. The government also has a ""Stop the spread"" page on its official website, which states that it aims to ""protect the health, safety and well-being of all people living with or caring for someone who is seriously ill"". I wonder if this is just a marketing ploy, as some governments seem to think that people are just lazy and will not take the time to care for their sick family members. Does anyone have any advice for how to stop this from happening to people who are already in such a state of disarray that they cannot get any help at all from their loved ones? Or are there some other things that could be done to slow this down, such as making sure everyone is physically active and taking care of their own needs, while also keeping some distance between themselves and others? Do any of these measures help prevent the outbreak? If not, how can I help my family, my friends and my community if I feel disoriented and unable to continue my daily activities? What are some things I could do that would help slow down this epidemic? Any help would also be greatly appreciated, especially if someone is in need of urgent care or is worried about their health or wellbeing. Please feel free to share your thoughts and concerns with your local authorities and health authorities, in particular the authorities in your country of residence, who can provide advice and support to your family and your community. In particular, please share what you have learned from your own experience and suggestions for"
" The most common symptoms are fever, tiredness, and shortness of breath. People can also have a number of other symptoms, including a runny nose, a dry cough, or difficulty breathing. These symptoms can be worse than the flu or the common cold, according to the World Health Organization.

However, there are some things that can cause a person to have these symptoms. For example, some people with coronavirus can have fever and cough. Other people who are not affected by the virus also don't seem to be affected at all. In fact, the WHO says that about half of all people in the world have some kind of fever or cough — about 1 in every 3 people. The WHO also recommends that people stay home if they feel unwell, especially if their temperature is above 140 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).
 But if you are worried about your health, you should talk with your doctor or other health care provider.

" There are several things you can do to reduce stress and reduce the amount of time you spend worrying about what you’re doing wrong. Here are some tips to help you get the most out of your day:


Practice self-care. Try to stay at least 6 feet away from others, especially your children. If possible, cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you are not in close contact with others. Avoid touching your face, as this can make you look like a child who has been spooked. Instead, wash your hands with soap and water, and use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap is not readily available.
If you have trouble breathing, use a breathing mask or mask with a disposable plastic bag. Place the mask on the floor or in the doorway, where it can catch droplets from people who are coughing or sneezing. Use a tissue to hold your mask in place while you cry or cry, or place it on a cloth or plastic sheet to protect it from splinters or other harmful particles. Follow the directions of local health authorities, including COVID-19 and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).
Stay home if you feel unwell. Talk to your health care provider about any symptoms, such as fever or shortness of breath, that are likely to be caused by the illness.  If you develop fever, seek medical attention and call in advance. Continue to practice social distancing and regular hand-washing, which can help keep you and your family physically and mentally healthy. Start by taking a walk or bicycle ride every 15 minutes or more, after meals and after going to the grocery store. Take a long, hard, gentle walk, often with hands and feet, for 20 to 30 seconds. Then, slowly lower your pace, gradually increasing your steps as you do so. Repeat this step-by-step approach for 30 to 45 minutes, until you reach your goal of completing 30 minutes of moderate-intensity walking or biking a few times a day. This is a good time to start planning a trip or a family outing, to share a room or room with someone who is sick or needs a place to rest or to take care of a loved one. For more information on how to keep healthy, see How much weight you need to lose to maintain your weight and how much you should add to it. 
Avoid social gatherings and gatherings that involve more than one person. Mass gatherings can be stressful and can cause you to feel isolated and isolated, making it more difficult to get to know and care for your loved ones. You can reduce your chances of being in a crowded or crowded place by:
Taking fewer than 10 minutes to sit down and talk to a friend or relative for a short period, then gradually increase your time between meetings to 10 or 20 minutes. Reduce the number of people in your group from 10 to 20, so that more people feel comfortable talking to each other and less is left to chance of getting in trouble if they are too close to one another. Increase the frequency of phone calls and emails from family and friends and encourage them to use the same number to reach out to you. Encourage people to talk about how they feel about the situation and the need for more help. Share your concerns and concerns with other people, using the hashtag #helpifyouneed to spread the news and help people find ways to make ends meet. Don't be afraid to ask a question or ask for help from a stranger. Ask questions and ask your questions directly to people you care about, rather than waiting for the answers to trickle in from the government or the private sector. Connect with people through social media and other means of communication, like video calls or video chats.

  
  Avoid gatherings where more adults are present. In addition, avoid gatherings in which more children live with parents or caretakers. These gatherings are intended to provide a space for children to learn and develop social skills and strengthen relationships. Children should be encouraged to play outside and play in groups, with adults and their family members. However, children should not be separated from their caregivers and should continue to attend social events and activities that help them learn about healthy relationships and healthy ways of caring for their own health and well-being.

" If you have a COVID-19 diagnosis, you should call your state or local public health department and ask about the status of your child’s school, college, or university. You should also check to see if the school has closed or is offering a voucher program for students who have been in the same institution for at least 14 days.


If you live in a state that has not yet imposed any new restrictions on students entering the country, the Department of Children and Families will continue to provide information and guidance to parents and students about school closures and other changes to their child care policies. For more information about how to prepare for and comply with state and local restrictions, see State and Local Policies and Guidance for Parents and Students About School Closures and Other Changes to Their Children's Care Policies. In addition, if you are a parent or student living in an institution that is closed, it is important to ensure that you follow all the rules and regulations of the institution, including any rules or regulations that may prevent you from enrolling in classes or activities that are not in compliance with these rules. To learn more about what is and is not allowed in some states, Learn about Dispensing and Disparate Expenses from Institutions that Are Closing or Are Providing a New Program for Students with Disabilities in Certain State, Territory, and Federal  
  Counties and territories that have closed their schools and universities, as appropriate, to avoid disruption to the health and safety of their students and their families, are encouraged to do so in accordance with their obligations under the Public Health Service Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act. If schools are closed for non-essential purposes, they must remain open for all students, regardless of whether they are employed, caring for a dependent child or are providing care for an ill child.  If a school does not provide any of these services, students may still be able to attend their institution of higher education, provided that they meet the following conditions:  (a) they have not been to a facility where an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to have occurred; and (b) there is no evidence that the student has had contact with a person with the illness or condition that poses a risk of exposure to or transmission of this coronavirus. The school must provide a copy of all documents required for the purpose of complying with this subsection and any other regulations promulgated by the department, in order to be allowed to continue providing services to students. Students who do not meet these conditions will be subject to dismissal and/or reduced rates of attendance.	
You should contact your school to determine if any restrictions are in place on the number of students that can be in attendance at a public institution. Some institutions may allow students to stay in their dormitories longer periods of time than others, but this may not be the case for some institutions. Many schools have policies and procedures for this purpose, which may be found at Faculty and Staff Relations of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. As with any change to your institution's policies or procedures, be sure to check them regularly for any changes and to review any guidance you may have received from the university regarding the use of “Student” ID numbers for purposes of eligibility for admission to and admission into the program. Universities may also require that any student who is denied admission because of a denial of admission must submit a written explanation of why he or she did not submit the explanation, along with proof of payment of any fees or other costs incurred in processing the denial. This is particularly important if a student is seeking to enter the U.S. as a refugee or permanent resident, for reasons other than to resettle in another country or to pursue a lawful work or educational purpose (such as to work as an organizer, translator, researcher, translator, scientist, physician, educator, research communicator, pharmacist, health care provider, social worker, etc.).  In some instances, universities may provide temporary and permanent residence permits that extend the period of stay allowed by their student-admission waiver programs, such as the OPT or OPT-C program, until the application is adjudicated and approved by a court of competent jurisdiction. However, these extensions may only be granted to people who are ""admitted aliens"" under section 212(a)(3)(B)(ii)(II), and they cannot be extended to nonimmigrants or lawful permanent residents (whether or not they were citizens or naturalized citizens at the time they entered the United States).  The Secretary of Homeland Security may, on a case-by-case basis, issue a temporary stay of some sort for certain aliens who were not previously admitted but are now inadmissible, even if they had no prior travel history to engage in activities related to this alien's status (e.g., to travel to another state for medical reasons).

" There are a number of things you can do to reduce your travel expenses. First of all, if you are planning to travel to a country outside of Switzerland, you should be aware that there are restrictions on international travel. For example, all international flights to and from the Schengen area must be cancelled. You can find more information on this here. Secondly, it is important to remember that you will not be allowed to enter Switzerland for any reason other than to visit family members in your country of residence. This is particularly important for people living in countries that are experiencing a pandemic like COVID-19. If you have been to any of these countries and are concerned about the possibility of your family member or loved one being affected by the coronavirus, please consult with your local authorities and be sure to check the relevant travel advisories and travel restrictions before you make any travel plans. The best way to ensure your safety and security is to stay in close contact with everyone you know and care about, including your loved ones, as much as possible. Don't forget to wear a mask and keep at least two feet away from anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Finally, make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before and after you leave the airport, especially after using the bathroom and before going to the doctor or other medical facility. Do not touch your face, hands, or face coverings with the use of a tissue or tissue bag. Always carry a medical mask with you when you board a flight, and wear one that has a Velcro closure around the front of the mask so that it cannot be easily laces or knobs on it. It is best to carry only one (non-essential) medical device (a mask) at all times, such as a hand sanitizer, mask or mask liners, in case you need to use it for personal protection purposes (e.g. to disinfect surfaces or disinfect personal protective equipment). You should also carry enough disposable medical equipment to cover your entire body (including your eyes, nose, mouth and nose) with one hand, so you don't have to worry about it spilling over into your arms or into the wrong hands. There is no evidence to suggest that wearing masks increases the risk of catching the virus. However, there is a growing body of evidence that people who wear masks are more likely to contract it and spread it to others. WHO is working on developing a vaccine to prevent the spread of Covid19 and is assessing ongoing research on how to best use existing vaccine development to protect people against the disease.

" The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to be contained in the saliva of people who have had contact with infected people. However, it is not known how long the virus will remain viable on surfaces.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has advised that people should wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before touching their face, before eating, and before going to the bathroom. This is to help protect the health system from viruses that may be on your hands and prevent it from spreading to others.

" Yes. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and it is a very large family of viruses that cause the common cold. 

The main difference between the two viruses is that they are very similar in their pathogenicity. Both are pathogenic to the same extent, but one of them is more deadly than the other. This is why coronaviruses are called ""common cold viruses"" and why the name of this virus is ""Wuhan Virus"". The other difference is the way in which it spreads. It is much easier for a virus to be transmitted from person to person than from animal to animal. So, if you are sick with the flu, for example, you can get it from a person who has been exposed to a flu strain that has a much higher chance of being a ""spreader"" than someone who is not sick.


So, is it safe to eat raw meat from animals that have been killed by the disease? Or is there a way to make a paste of it and make it into something that can be eaten by humans? I am not an expert in animal medicine, so I don't know much about the biology of animal products. But, I do know that there are a few things that I can do to help reduce the risk of catching the new virus.
I am also interested in understanding how the different types of virus are spread. For instance, are there any known ways to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus? If so, what are some of those ways that could be effective in preventing the infection? Also, would it be possible to create a vaccine to protect the people who are most at risk?

" I am a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Waterloo. 

I am looking for a way to help my students and faculty in their efforts to reduce the spread of the virus. I have been working on a project that would allow me to measure the number of people infected in a given area over time. The project would be to use a simple model to estimate how many people are infected over a period of time, and how long that period will last. In this model, each infected person would have a probability of infecting at least one other person over the course of their stay in that area. This probability would then be used to calculate the probability that the next person will be infected, based on the current probability distribution of those who have the disease. For this project, I would use the following equation:
$$\tag{19}\begin{bmatrix}
S_{t+1} &amp;=\hat{x}_t \triangleq \text{for} \,\, t=0, 1, 2, \dots$$
where $S$ is the time between when the infection occurred and when it was detected. $P$ and $D$ are the days since the first case was identified, which is a time of day that is known as the ""day of contact"", and this day is called ""Date of onset of illness"". I will use this date as a starting point for the calculation of my probability for getting sick over this period, since I want to be able to make a reasonable estimate of how much time has passed since my last contact with the person who is currently sick, given that I do not have any symptoms at all. My goal is to minimize the amount of spread that could be caused by the project by using a model that does not take into account the fact that my data is not perfect, so that it is likely to overestimate the true rate of transmission.


The problem with this approach is that, even if I could model the data in this way, it would still be very difficult to accurately predict the actual rate at which people will get sick. It is therefore very important to have some sort of prior information about the transmission rate, e.g. a prior with which I can make predictions about how fast the epidemic will progress, i.e. how quickly it will reach a certain point in time (in this case, a few days). This prior is very hard to obtain, because the likelihood of being infected at any given time is extremely low. Furthermore, the prior can only be accurately predicted at a very early stage, when there is no sign of a pandemic. Therefore, in order to get a good prior, you need to know a lot more about what is going on in your field. If you are not familiar with epidemiology, then you will not understand how to model this prior well enough to understand the real-world consequences of your prior. So, this is where the problem comes in, as you can see from the graph below.
This is because, if you were to take a step back and look at how the outbreak has progressed in China, for example, from January to March, there was a significant increase in cases, but this was not accompanied by a dramatic drop in deaths. As a result, China had a much larger increase of cases than the United States, although the latter is more or less equally asymptomatic (although the mortality rate is still much higher).
In addition, due to the exponential growth in infections, we are now beginning to see a large decrease in fatalities, though this may be due in part to people not being vaccinated against the new coronavirus (which is why the CDC is recommending that all people with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV be vaccinated). 



  This is also the case for other infectious diseases such as influenza, malaria, adenovirus, rabies, dengue, polio, rhinoviruses, rubella, Ebola, SARS, MERS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Zika, all of which have significantly reduced the risk of developing serious illness. However, these diseases are still very much under the control of WHO and the World Health Organisation (WHO) as of March 30, 2020. WHO has been very clear that they will continue to work with all countries to ensure the safety and well-being of all patients and their families, including those at risk for severe illness, until the situation is safe and everyone is free to return to their home countries. They are also encouraging people to self-isolate and to stay away from other people, especially if they are sick with a common cold or a cold related to a family member (such as someone who has recently become ill). WHO is working with health authorities around the world to develop a plan"
" I live in Germany. I am a citizen of the European Economic Area (EEA). I have a residence permit issued by the Federal Office for Immigration (Bundesverfassungsführer öffentlichen Österrechnik zum Raum) which I can apply for in person at the border checkpoint. However, I do not have any documents to prove my residency. Therefore, my only option is to file for a new residence card (in order to extend my residence).


My application is still pending, but my current residence status is valid until the end of March 2020. If I file my application in April 2020, it will be inadmissible for me to enter the country for the next 14 months.
However, the application does not apply to me for this reason: I don't have proof of residency, and I would not be able to travel to the EU until after the 14 month period I applied for residence (i.e. after March 31, 2020).
Therefore, if I apply again in May 2020 (which I hope will happen), I will have to pay the fees for my new residency card, which is not refundable.



  I understand that the current situation is very different from the one in my home country. My wife lives in a country with no restrictions on her movement. She is allowed to leave her country of residence to go to another country (for example, to return to Germany), but she cannot do so without permission from her husband. So, she can only do this with the permission of his/her ex-partner (if he/she is a German citizen or resident of another EU country, then she is entitled to stay in that country and continue her residence there). But, as a result of this situation, we have decided to postpone our planned return trip (to the Netherlands, for example), and we are now planning to continue our trip in March 2021 (with the exception of a short stay at a hospital in Wroclaw, Poland). We are also considering postponing our return visit to Poland, because we feel that this would be detrimental to our health and the welfare of our family, since we would have no way of knowing that we will continue to live together in Poland (as we already do in other EU countries, e.g. in Romania, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Slovakia, Slovenia, etc.).
But, in light of all this, does the fact that my wife is now in her 30s, mean that she has no legal right to move? If so, how can I explain to her why I should not continue my trip? I mean, why should I not stay with her at all?  If she decides to remain at home, is there a legal basis for her to refuse my entry? Or is it just a matter of convenience? Do I still have legal rights, or does it make no difference whether she stays with me or not? Also, what is the situation regarding my visa application? Is it still possible to proceed with our travel, even if it is only for one or two months? Does this matter whether I continue on my travel? What are the legal reasons for not continuing my visit? Are there other reasons besides convenience that would make me not bother to cancel my planned visit, such as the possibility of getting sick or having a serious case of infection in another member of my household (or other family members)?
Thank you in advance for your answers!  In particular, do you think that your wife's refusal of entry is also a reason to delay her return flight, given that you have already cancelled your trip and she already has a long-term medical condition that prevents her from returning to your country? Alternatively, would it be better if you could just postpone your return journey, rather than wait until her condition worsens and then postpone it for another couple of months, while she continues to suffer from chronic medical conditions that limit her access to a safe and regular place to spend her time? Thanks!

" There is currently no evidence to support the use of oral contraceptives as a means of preventing the spread of the virus. However, there is a growing body of research that suggests that some contraceptive methods, including the pill, may be effective in preventing or treating the coronavirus.  In particular, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that all women start using oral contraceptives within 14 days of intercourse, and that every woman with a suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection should start using a method of contraception that is safe and effective for her health and proper use in the context of her current or previous contraceptive use.

However, some research suggests that the contraceptive pill may not be as effective as some other methods. For example, a study published in the American Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (JAMA) found that women who had experienced a miscarriage had a significantly higher risk of miscarriage than women without a previous miscarriage, but this risk was not significantly different for those with and without comorbid conditions or for those who did not have a prior miscarriage. Other reports suggest that contraceptive pills may help prevent or treat some types of sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV and syphilis, which are more prevalent among women with underlying medical conditions and are thought to be more infectious and more severe than HIV/AIDS. These findings are consistent with the recommendations of World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who stated in a press briefing on March 27, 2020, that: 


  “We don’t know enough about the long-term safety and effectiveness of any of these methods to say whether they are effective or not. We do know that they reduce the number of new infections in women and increase the chance of infection in men. But they do not protect against or cure the disease.”  That is why we need to continue to use them as directed. They are not effective. And they should be used only for the prevention or treatment of serious diseases, not for treating or preventing serious illnesses.   We should use the contraceptives that are most effective and least harmful for preventing, treating and treating these diseases to prevent and treat the underlying conditions that cause the most serious illness, like HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and other infectious diseases. The contraceptive method we use is the only effective way to protect ourselves and our loved ones from the many viruses that can cause illness and can be transmitted from person to person. It is not enough to just wash your hands, wipe your face, cover your coughs and sneezes with soap and water. You must also use a wipeable cloth or cloth covering to cover the entire surface of your mouth and nose. If you are wearing a cloth mask, put it on your head or around your neck, so that you can breathe in and out without touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Use a disposable mask if you have one, as it can catch viruses from other people who are nearby and spread it to others. Wear a face mask when you go to the bathroom or other public areas, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if it is visibly soiled or disinfected. Remember, masks and face masks should only be worn by health care workers and not by anyone under the age of 60. WHO recommends that all people wear masks when they leave the house or go about their daily lives, except for essential public health and medical services. To protect yourself and others from viruses, you should wear a mask and good respiratory hygiene. This includes covering your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or tissue when walking, lying down or otherwise touching objects or surfaces. Follow the directions of local health authorities and the local community for any restrictions on the movement of people, goods and people around the world that may pose a risk to you, your health or the health of others in your community. Do not leave your home unless absolutely necessary to avoid unnecessary suffering or for other reasons. Why? WHO is working with governments and non-governmental organisations to ensure that people living with or without health conditions are given the best possible care and support to deal with their personal and community health needs.

" There is a lot of misinformation out there about coronavirus testing. Some of it is based on misinformation and misinformation from the media, but there are many other things that are true and important to know about. Here are a few things you should be aware of:


1. The CDC does not test for COVID-19. This is because the virus is not known to cause illness in humans. It is believed to only spread from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when a person coughs or sneezes. People who are infected do not develop symptoms and are not contagious. However, people who have been in contact with people with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection are at higher risk of developing severe illness and death. For more information on how the disease spreads, see https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/2019-ncov/en/about-who-is-most-likely-to-experience-severe-conditions-if-they-are-infected-with-the-coronaviruse-2019.html
2. There are no approved drugs or therapies that can prevent or cure the illness. Instead, treatment consists of supportive care and physical activity, as recommended by the American College of Rheumatology. To learn more about how to safely and effectively use and use these therapies, read about “Manage Your Anxiety,” by Dr. Jennifer Ashton, M.D., a professor of family medicine at the University of North Carolina’s Perelman School of Medicine and chair of its Center for Emotional Intelligence and Cognition at Duke University Medical Center, which is dedicated to understanding and treating anxiety and stress. Learn more at: http://cognition.duke.edu/resources/Managing-Your-Panic-Trouble-by-Dr.Jill Ashton.pdf
3. Certain types of vaccines, including the flu shot and the pneumococcal vaccine, are safe and effective against certain viruses. These vaccines are also used in certain situations, such as in the emergency room, to prevent the spread of certain respiratory diseases. Read more here:  Vaccine Safety and Illness in Emergency Room Settings: How Vaccines Can Help Protect You and Protect Your Family from Infectious Diseases  (NCIPR).  
4. If you have a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. Call in advance and ask your healthcare provider to call in order to make sure you and your family members are being cared for in a way that is consistent with your health and well-being.

" The coronavirus is a new virus that has not been seen before in humans. It is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes. This is why it is important to avoid touching your face, especially your eyes, nose and mouth. However, there are currently no known cases of COVID-19 in the general population. Therefore, the aim of this article is to provide a simple and practical way to protect yourself and your family against the virus.


How can I protect myself and my loved ones against coronovirus if I am wearing a mask and have no fever, cough or shortness of breath? What are the symptoms and if any other symptoms are present? How do I know if my family member is at risk of developing any of these symptoms or if they are showing any signs of illness?
If you have any symptoms, seek medical attention immediately and call in advance. If you are not able to attend the funeral or visitation of your loved one, you may be in breach of the law and need to report the matter to the local authorities.
You should also carry a medical mask with you when you leave the house, as this will prevent you from infecting other people. You can find more information on how to safely carry medical masks at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronaviruses/2019-ncov/about-medical-masks-and-how-to-protect-yourself/advice-for-getting-out-of-the-house-without-a-mask.html
What is the best mask design for protecting yourself? Are there any masks that are suitable for everyday use and are easy to wear? Do any manufacturers recommend different types of masks for different situations? If so, what are some tips for choosing the right type of mask for your specific situation? I would like to hear your thoughts on this question. Please feel free to share your own experiences and suggestions for the next steps in your field.

" I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. My advisor is a professor of computer science and engineering. She is currently working on a paper on the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Her paper is titled ""A Novel Coronavirus: Mechanisms for Its Mechanism and Its Application in Human Microbiological Systems."" It is an open-access, peer-reviewed research paper, and it aims to answer the following questions:


What is the mechanism by which the virus is evolving? What are the biological processes that are involved in its evolution? How are these processes regulated and how do they differ from other coronaviruses? Are there any biological mechanisms that can account for the different evolutionary paths of this virus? Is it possible to model this evolution in a way that is consistent with the observed patterns of viral RNA in biological systems, or is it more likely to be an artifact of natural selection? 
I am interested in this question because I think it is very important to understand how viruses are regulated. For example, I have seen a lot of papers in Nature and Nature Biotechnology about the regulation of RNA polymerase activity in viruses. I would like to know how this regulation is regulated in an organism that has evolved to survive in environments where RNA is abundant. Is there a mechanism that regulates this? If so, how does it vary from organism to organism and from region to region? I hope that this answer will help me in my research.  



  In addition, my advisor has a Ph.D. in molecular biology and bioinformatics at Imperial College London, where she is also a co-author of several papers on this topic. In her spare time, she has been a contributing editor to a number of journals, including the Journal of Molecular and Cell Biology (JMC), the journal of molecular genetics and virology (jmclb.org), and the International Journal on Molecular Medicine (IJM). She has also been an active participant in several international conferences and conferences, as well as being a frequent contributor to scientific publications on virological topics.

 (Note: I do not mean to imply that these are necessarily mutually exclusive, but rather that they are important in understanding the biology of viruses and their interaction with other viruses, e.g. see my answer to that question here.)
In addition to her work as an editor of JMC's journal Molecular Biology and Biology of Infectious Diseases (MBLiB), she also serves as a visiting professor at Harvard Medical School, the John Hopkins School of Public Health (HSPH). Her research interests include the development of novel antiviral drugs for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and related respiratory diseases; the prevention and treatment of influenza virus infections; and clinical trials of antivirals for HIV/AIDS. Currently, her research focuses on understanding how the immune system functions in response to viral infections, such as the common cold, acute myelitis, rhinovirus, Epstein–Barr, rabies, hepatitis, influenza, HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, adenoviral polysaccharide (a type of virus that damages the cell membrane by damaging the capsular adhesion molecule), hepatitis B virus (HCV), HIV-1, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) vaccine, human chorionic gonadotropin-releasing factor (hCGVR), poly(A) receptor (PSR)-binding protein (pBRP), or tumor suppressor (TNF)-alpha/gamma signaling protein, in order to better understand the role of these proteins in regulating immune responses to infectious diseases. This research is funded by NIH grants and is being conducted under the leadership of Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, a postdoc and chair of Harvard's Center for Biomedical Research on Immunology and Immunogenetics (CBRi).
Her work has appeared in journals ranging from PLOS ONE (March 2019) to Nature (April 2019). In the same journal, JAMA (Jan. 2020) she authored a systematic review of existing evidence supporting the use of corticosteroids for treating acute viral gastroenteritis (GTO) in children and adolescents with suspected or confirmed GTO. The review was based on data from a large cohort of clinicaltrials (n=6,811) involving children aged 5–17 years, with a median age of onset of symptoms of gastro-intestinal symptoms >3.5 years. Of these, 2–3% were mild or no symptoms at all. Overall, there was no evidence of a significant difference between children with mild symptoms and those who did not develop symptoms. However, children younger than 5 years"
" I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. My advisor is a professor of computer science and engineering. She is currently working on a paper describing a novel coronavirus model. Her paper is based on the work of a group of collaborators, including a number of researchers from the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the United States, who have used the same model to predict the 2019-nCoV outbreak. In the paper, they use a model that was published in Nature (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41548-020-0399-x/fulltext/doi:10.1038/nature14002) and are using a more recent (and much more detailed) model, which is published by BioRxiv in a peer-reviewed journal. Their model is very similar to that of Johns Hopkins, in that it uses a much larger dataset (more than 200,000 records), but uses more sophisticated statistical techniques (e.g. Gaussian likelihood, Bayesian likelihood). The authors of their model are also very well-known for their work in epidemiology, for example in this paper: http://dx.doi.org/abs.jhin.2020.01.022
The authors also point out that the models are not perfect and that they may be biased towards the wrong direction. For example, one could argue that this is because the data is not representative of all the possible outcomes, or that there is no way to know whether the prediction is correct or not. They also note that their models may not be perfect because they do not account for the effects of sampling bias (i.e., sampling error).
I am not aware of any published research on this topic, so I can't comment on their claims. However, I do know that a recent paper by a team of Chinese researchers (in the journal Nature Communications) has a very detailed and detailed model for a new SARS-like virus. This is in fact a large-scale, multi-year project, with a lot of data and lots of simulation data. It is being used in many different epidemiological scenarios, from malaria control to malaria-related disease control. I would like to hear from anyone who has done this work, whether they have a good or bad experience with this kind of research, how they can help in developing a better model and how it can be applied to future epidemics. If you have any good experience, please share your results with me and I will try my best to answer your questions as quickly as possible. Thank you!

" What is the current status of the COVID-19 pandemic in Central and South-eastern Asia?
The current situation is very different from the situation in Wuhan, China, where the disease has been contained. However, there are still significant human-to-human transmission issues. For example, the virus is thought to be mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets generated when a person coughs or sneezes. This is why it is important to regularly clean hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing. WHO is working closely with local health authorities to ensure the safety and well-being of all people living with or travelling with HIV, including those with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. More information about WHO's ongoing efforts to contain and control the novel coronavirus is available on its official website.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"

" What is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from the coronavirus that is spreading around the world?
We live in a world where we are constantly being told to stay indoors, stay at home, wash our hands often, avoid touching our faces, cover our coughs and sneezes with our bent elbow or tissue when we cough or sneeze, and stay home if we feel unwell. 
But what if I am sick and need to go to the doctor? What if my loved one needs to call in advance to make arrangements for me to be home for a period of time that I will not be able to care for? 


I am a senior citizen in my country of nationality, so I have the right to visit my family in the UK. However, I do not have a permanent residence card, which means I can only travel to and from my home country. So, my only option is to contact the local authorities and ask them to issue me a temporary visitor card (for a short period) to extend my stay. But, that would be a huge waste of my time, money and precious time for the government to hand out to people who are in need of urgent care and care, not to mention the risk of the virus spreading to others in our community and the potential for it to spread to other people too!
So, what are some things you can do to reduce your chances of being in harm's way by staying indoors and avoiding contact with anyone who is sick or ill, especially if you are a child or young adult, or who has a history of serious illness, such as heart or lung disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer or any other chronic or chronic condition that could seriously affect your health and well-being (e.g. cancer)?
If you have been to a hospital, a mental health facility or a tertiary care facility, you should follow the advice of your local health authority and their advice will be based on your circumstances and how best to manage your illness and wellbeing.

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with soap and water, including using a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap is not available. If soap isn't readily available, use alcohol-based hand rub or soap with a neutral pH of 0.5 for 5 minutes to kill viruses, bacteria and other harmful substances. Follow the directions of local councils and health authorities on how to safely dispose of personal protective equipment (PPE) and ensure proper use of hand hygiene when handling PPE. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces with household disinfectant wipes and household bleach. Avoid touching objects or surfaces that are visibly or visibly dirty or contaminated with viruses or bacteria. Wash hands frequently with detergent and soap before, during or after the stay, to prevent the spread of viruses and bacteria that may be on, in or about your body. Use soap or water only when necessary to disinfect or disinfect surfaces. Do not use household cleaners that have not been properly disinfected and must be reapplied to surfaces where the cleaning agent has been applied. Disposable household cleaning products should be disposed of in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions for use when disposing of household cleansers. Always wash hands after use with clean, non-sterile household products. Never touch any surface that has the appearance of contact lens, eye, nose, mouth or other respiratory droplets on it or on objects, surfaces or objects in its path. Dirty laundry from a laundromat, laundry service or laundry facility must meet the following requirements: It must not contain more than 1% (1/3) per cent (ppm) of HCoV-2, the active ingredient in this drug, if the product is in any packaging or packaging material intended for human consumption. The product must remain in good mechanical condition and be of acceptable quality and purity. It is important to maintain a minimum of 1 metre (3 feet) distance between themselves and anyone in their household. This distance is for personal protection purposes only and does not apply to:Smoking,drinking,smoking,eating,orcloset-wearing (including faceshifts and body bags)People under the age of 18 must wear a mask and comply with all local restrictions on public gatherings, gatherings and gatherings of less than 10 people.Children under 5 years of age should wear appropriate face coverings and"
" The Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that includes the common cold, influenza, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, rabies, rubella, dengue, Ebola, Zika, MERS, and SARS. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the ""common cold virus"". The name of this virus comes from the Latin name for the disease, meaning ""to kill"".  The disease causes fever, cough and shortness of breath. It is thought to be transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when a person coughs or sneezes. People are most contagious when they are in close contact with someone who is sick with coronavirus. However, there are cases of people who are more contagious than others. This is why it is important to stay at home when you are sick. You should wash your hands often with soap and water and avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Follow the directions of your local health authority and local authorities to ensure that you do not touch your face, mouth or eyes. If you have fever or cough, seek medical attention and call in advance.

" I have a question about the coronavirus. 

I am a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I am looking for a way to make a computer program to predict the spread of COVID-19 in real-time using a simple model. The model is a distributed distributed data structure that can be modeled in a number of ways. One of the ways I can model the virus is to use it as a starting point. For example, I could use the data to estimate the relative risk of getting sick from a single person (i.e. how many people get sick). The data would be a logistic function, where I would use a binomial distribution to determine the likelihood of being sick. In the example above, the probability is $P(\text{S}_{t-1} \times t} = \frac{\partial p}{\partial t}}{1- p}\hat{x}_t \triangleq p \left( 0 \right)^2)$. The likelihood is the sum of all the possible outcomes $p$ and $t$ for the SIRD model $S = 0,1,2,3,\dots$$
$$\tag{20}\frac{p}{t} p_0 &amp;= \sum_{s=0}^s^t \\
\end{bmatrix}$$


The problem with this approach is that I do not know how the model fits into the real world, so I don't have any idea how it would fit into a simulation. So I'm trying to figure out how to fit it into my PhD thesis.
In the meantime, my advisor has sent me an email asking me to contact her and ask her to help me with the problem. She is very nice and helpful, and she has given me a lot of ideas, but she is not very specific about what I should try to do to get the best answer out of her. It seems that she does not want to hear from me about problems that are not directly related to the current pandemic, such as the one that is currently unfolding in China (which is also a very real problem). So she will not be able to answer directly, except to say something like ""hey, this is really hard"" or something along the lines of ""it's not really worth bothering with"". I think that if she really wants to know what is going on, then she should contact me directly and explain the situation, rather than just emailing me and asking for advice on the next steps. But she seems to be very busy and busy right now, which makes it difficult to reach her directly. Also, she doesn't seem to have the time to reply directly to me, although she did reply to my email a few days ago (and I sent her the link to her email address). I wonder how she would respond to such a request, given that her advisor seems very interested in hearing about my thesis and is sending me emails about it, e.g. asking if I need more help, or if it is just a waste of time for me (since I already have an advisor who is busy).  I hope that this will help her in her efforts to find a solution to this problem, if not, at least, in some cases, it may help in other areas too (such as in my field of mechanical engineering, for example), so that there is no need to send her emails again and again, just that they may have some more ideas for what should be done to improve the solution (in particular, things like a more detailed explanation of what the simulation is doing, etc.).  In any case, would it be better if the advisor was more specific and specific in what she was asking about, since she might have more direct contact with me?  Or is it better to just send me the email and not bother to ask for help again?
Thank you in advance!   (I would appreciate it if you could reply as soon as possible to any of my questions, especially if there are any that you think are relevant to your thesis, as I may be missing some important information that might be of interest to others in your field. If you are interested, please let me know if this would help your research in any way, whether it helps your advisor or not.)  If I had to choose between sending you a generic email or sending a mail that says ""thank you for your help"", I probably would choose the latter, because it makes me feel more at home and helps me focus more on my research, not wasting time on other things (like studying something else that interests me more than my own research). But I also feel a little guilty about not sending the mail at all (because I feel like I shouldn't be sending it to anyone else, even if that person knows me better than me), since it feels more like an excuse to not interact with anyone who isn't interested"

" Yes, but only if they have been in the US for at least 14 days. 

If you are not a citizen of the United States, you can apply for a work-visa waiver from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) at https://www.dhs.gov/documents/coronavirus-relief-requirements.pdf. It is important to note that the DHS does not have the authority to issue such a waiver, so it is best to contact your local law enforcement agency to find out what they are doing about it. You can find more information on how DHS issues work visas here.
The DHS has also issued guidance to nonimmigrants who are claimed as a dependent of a US citizen or permanent resident (as defined in section 212(a)(9)(B)(iv)(I)), as well as to individuals who were claimed by a nonimmigrant spouse or dependent on Form I-94, as of March 30, 2020, and are otherwise entitled to a Social Security Number (SSN) for purposes of eligibility for the payment of any tax imposed by this Act on the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income over the tax year in which they claimed the alienation, whichever is later. The guidance also provides that you may not be claimed for any refund under section 505(g)(2)(A)(ii)(II) if you fail to file your tax return within 90 days after the end of your 14-day period of claimed status, unless the Secretary determines that your return is not timely filed. If you do not meet the requirements of this subsection, your application will be considered nonfrivolous and you will not receive a refund. However, if your claim is for an extension of stay or change of status (for which you did not file a timely return), you must file the return as soon as possible after your status is no longer valid. For more on this, see How do I file my return if I am a claimed alien? 


You may still be able to claim the Extension of Status Extension (FOI) waiver under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), but the process for doing so is different than for COVID-19. See the section entitled ""Exemptions for Certain Aliens who Are Dependent on or Are Residing in a Country with a Suspended or Canceled Federal, State, or Local Law Enforcement Act of 1948"" for more details. Under the Act, an alien who is claimed under this provision is subject to the following conditions:   (1) The alien has not been physically present within the Schengen Area for 14 calendar days prior to his or her claim,
(2) He or she is a bona fide resident alien (i.e., a ""nonimmigrant alien""),
  and (3) Upon expiration of such alien's stay, the application was not filed inadmissible or falsified in any way, except as provided in subsection (e)(3).
However, in order to get a stay of INA 222 (relating to aliens who have not yet claimed their status), a person must have filed and been properly present at the time the claim was filed with the USCIS. In addition, any alien claiming to be a DI or EOS or alien with permanent residence status who was unlawfully present during the 14 day period preceding the date of claim application must submit a written explanation of why he/she did so, including any evidence of prior unauthorized entry or attempted entry, proof of citizenship or lawful re-entry, a copy of an identification document, documentation of non-custodial parent(s) or legal guardian(ies), and any other form of evidence necessary to support the claimed purpose for claiming the status. A nonrefundable tax credit of up to $500 is available for nonfilers who file their tax returns after April 15 of 2020 and before April 30 of 2021. This credit is limited to amounts that are forgiven by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the ""Tax Code""), which was enacted to provide relief for filers with pre-tax incomes over $75,000 and after July 1, 2021, which were not refundable during that calendar year. To qualify for this credit, one must be filing and had a valid work authorization (such as an ESTA) and have a residence permit issued by another state or territory. Once the credit has been applied for, it cannot be used to pay any additional taxes, credits or other payments, such as refunds or extensions of tax benefits, until the next taxable year begins.

" Yes, but only if you are planning to travel to or from the US. 

You should contact your travel agent and ask if they will allow you to board the flight, and if so, how long you will be allowed to stay at the airport. You should also check to make sure you have all the necessary documents, including your Social Security Number, your passport and any insurance you may have. If you do not have insurance, you should ask your insurance company to cover the cost of the trip.
If you need to cancel your trip, it is possible to do so by phone or online. However, this is not guaranteed, as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has a process in place to prevent telephonic cancellations and other disruptions of international flights, so be sure to check your carrier's policies for any restrictions on this kind of travel.


  Does the travel ban apply to all US citizens or residents who have been in the Schengen area for at least 14 days?
No. The ban does not affect US residents or nonimmigrants who entered the EU through the UK or Ireland. It only applies to people who arrived in or attempted to enter the United States during the 14-day period preceding their entry, regardless of whether they had a valid US-issued travel document and were not claimed as a ""green card holder"". 



  What is the legal basis for a travel restriction that prevents me from traveling to, or entering, the U.S. for the following reasons:
I have a medical condition that requires me to self-isolate in order to care for my family, my partner and my child; I have recently been diagnosed with COVID-19; or I am in a state of undiagnosed or suspected illness that renders my health condition worse than that of my spouse or family member; My child is in need of care or care-related services that are essential to the child’s well-being; The child has been placed in an institution of higher education or training that is substantially equivalent to a public institution in terms of skills and knowledge that would be required for an employee of a comparable level of education; A child who is physically or mentally incapacitated would pose a risk of serious harm to myself or others if I were to exercise my rights under the law to leave my home, work, school, religious practice or other public or private sector activities; An alien with a history of domestic or international violence or child endangerment who presents with symptoms consistent with the severity of illness or the likelihood of future illness;
My spouse is a US citizen or permanent resident and has not been physically present within the last 30 days. Does this mean that I will not be able to visit my children at home? Or is it possible that the children will continue to attend school in accordance with my domestic and international obligations, even if my wife is unable to return to her home country after the 30 day period of absence? If yes, what rights are there to visitation and visitation rights for children who are not yet in school? Is this a legal right or a political right? Does visitation or visitation be considered a form of child support? What are the rights and responsibilities of an unmarried parent in relation to their child visitation? Are there any legal rights or responsibilities for unmarried parents who wish to continue their children's education, research or research activities outside of their household? I would like to know if there are any federal, state or local laws or regulations that specifically address this aspect of visitation, such as visitation orders, visitation decrees, child custody orders or any other legal or regulatory measures that may be necessary to protect children from harm caused by the visitation order. I understand that some states and local governments have enacted statutes or ordinances that explicitly address these issues, e.g. Illinois has enacted a law that prohibits the ""unlawful presence of aliens"" (i.e. non-citizens) in certain circumstances, while other states have not. Is there a federal or state court system that can issue such orders? Do these orders have to be enforced by a local or national law enforcement agency or by an individual with authority to enforce them? How can I contact my attorney about these matters? Any guidance or legal advice I can provide regarding this issue should be directed to my state attorney general, not the F.D.C., and should include guidance on how to proceed in civil cases arising out of or related to this matter. Do I still have legal standing to sue my ex-partner for wrongful termination if he or she is found to have caused the harm that caused him or her to harm himself or herself in violation of this order? Should I file a lawsuit in federal court to try to get the government to compensate me for this harm? (I am not a party to any of these proceedings, however, I do have the right to seek compensatory and punitive damages in addition to damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress or loss of liberty.)"
" It’s possible that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be passed from one person to another through droplets from the nose or mouth, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the CDC recommends that people stay home if they feel unwell and cough or sneeze into their elbow or other area of the body.
 If you have symptoms, call your doctor or local health department and seek medical attention, said Dr. Jennifer Griffin, a coronavirus expert at the George Washington University School of Medicine. She said the best way to protect yourself is to avoid touching your face, mouth or eyes, and to wash your hands with soap and water before and after you leave the hospital. You can also use an alcohol-based hand rub or a hand sanitizer to help ease the symptoms. But if you're worried that you might be sick, use a product that contains at least 60 percent alcohol and is safe to use, Griffin said. [See How to Wash Your Hands with Alcohol-Based Hand Rub](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/health/coronaviruse-hand-rub.html) and use it at home instead of at a pharmacy or drugstore, she added.  
  “If you are sick and want to get medical help, you should talk to your health care provider about using products that are safe and effective for you and your family,” Griffin told Mother Jones. The CDC has also developed a list of products and services that can help people with respiratory illnesses, including masks, gowns, gloves, face shields, eye protection and face masks.

" Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that the coronavirus can be stopped or reversed.  The only way to prevent or reverse the virus from spreading is to use good respiratory hygiene and avoid touching your face, nose or mouth.

However, it is important to maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. If you are too close, you should wash your hands with soap and water, cover your cough with a tissue and throw the tissue in the trash. Follow the directions of local authorities and health authorities on how to dispose of discarded tissue, including the local authority for disposing of it. You should also carry a disinfectant bottle with you when you leave the house, to help protect you and your loved ones from viruses that may be spreading around your house. The best disinfectants are those that are commonly used in homes and businesses, such as Bleach and Bleach Plus, which are often used to disinfect household cleaners and other household items.

" The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to be contained in the saliva of people who have had contact with infected people. However, it is not known how long the virus lasts on surfaces.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has said that people should avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth. They advise people to wash their hands with soap and water if they are feeling unwell and to cover their mouth with their bent elbow when they cough or sneeze.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" I am a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I have been working on an open source software development framework for distributed systems engineering (DSE). The framework is based on the COVID-19 model, which is a dynamic distributed system model that can be used to predict the future behavior of systems. It has been tested on Linux, Mac OS X, and Linux distributions. In this blog post I will show you how to use the framework to build a simulation program to model the evolution of a system. You can download the code from github here: https://github.com/wilsoncovid19/COVID19Simulator/blob/master/csgo/cgo.go#L8
You can find the source code in this repository:
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Project_of_the_20%E2%80%9320_World_War_II_Programming_Strategy_in_Cyber-Assisted_Mechanical_Dynamics_with_Infected_by_Organized_Coronaviruses_and_CoV_Wuhan
The simulation code is available on github:   http://docs.google.co.uk/forms/d/dlg/events/view/index.cfm?key=key&source=view&ct=default&gt;u=&amp;v=1&tid=19&sig=cgv2&q=CGE_19_Simulation_Data&cdg=0&vb=https%3A%2F% 2F.aft.uiv.wa.ac.ca%26facepartment%27skeynote%28%29.pdf
I am looking for a way to integrate the simulation into a real-world application, e.g. a database where I can quickly see how the system evolves over time. This would be great if you could help me understand the dynamic nature of an organism and how it is regulated by different regulatory regimes. If you have some ideas, please feel free to forward them to me.

" Yes, but only if you are accompanied by a health care professional. 

The CDC recommends that you stay at least 6 feet away from anyone who is sick with COVID-19 and is coughing or sneezing or has difficulty breathing. If you have fever or other symptoms, call your doctor or local public health department.
 You can get tested for the virus if someone in your household tests positive for it. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to avoid social gatherings, such as sporting events, or gatherings of more than 10 people. You should also wash your hands after you leave the house, and use the same bathroom and bathroom as the person who tested positive, according to the CDC.


If you do decide to go outside, be sure to follow the directions of your local health authority, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for guidance on how to stay safe in and around public spaces, including public restrooms and public areas. It’s also important to wear a mask when out in public, as it can pose a risk to you and your family members if people close their eyes, nose or mouth when they see you. And be aware of the signs that people may be touching or touching your body during this time.
