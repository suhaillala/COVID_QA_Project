"As the German chancellor said today, by the end of the year 60-70% of the population will have been through a COVID-19 infection. Where does that number come from?

The basic mechanism is clear, and the magnitude is plausible: Let n be the average number of persons infected by one infected person. If n falls below 1, then the epidemy will run out. This will happen if an infected person mostly hits persons who are already immune.

The question is: Why just 60-70%, not 40-50 or 80-90%? Does it come from historic precedence? Or from some formula that takes into account the value of n (the value before saturation has set in)? What citation classics could serve as reference?
","some canadian experts said 35  to 70  will be infected:    according to a disease-transmission model developed by university of  toronto researchers, the virus  overall attack rate in canada could  exceed 70 per cent. that number drops sharply, by about half,  if we  add modest control,  said epidemiologist dr. david fisman, one of the  model is creators, but it will take  aggressive social distancing and  large scale quarantines  to reduce it further, he said.     that is still a huge number of people ill, and critically ill people  are a large fraction in this disease,  fisman said in an email.  i am  not going to share more specific numbers because i think they will  scare people to no particular end.    in reality no one knows. i can tell you if they contain the spread no more people will be infected. if they do not contain the spread more people will be infected. steps like italy took today where only essential work can occur and all business closed except transportation, grocery stores and pharmacies are a desperate attempt at containment that may be too late. that said given recent numbers it appears to have worked for china.  the german chancellor is wasting her time and ours spewing off meaningless numbers that will only serve to scare citizens of the nation she is supposed to lead. something better would be her plan to make the homeless self-isolate for 14 days at home if they come into contact with someone who was positive or preemptively positive.  today the who leader said if american governments  federal, state, county, city, etc  do not act it could be  many, many millions  dead in the usa. today is us government talk to borrow 40 billion dollars to spend on the pandemic is not a plan.

How long does the virus survive on surfaces?,"it is not certain how long the virus that causes covid-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. studies suggest that coronaviruses  including preliminary information on the covid-19 virus  may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. this may vary under different conditions  e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment .  if you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.",55
"Someone I know booked a return flight on Air Serbia from Vienna to Podgorica (Montenegro) via Belgrade, departing on 6 March 2020 and returning on 14 March 2020.  On 10 March 2020, Air Serbia cancelled the return leg from Belgrade to Vienna without explanation; the passenger contacted Air Serbia by phone, who rebooked them on the next available flight, 24 hours later than the original return date.  Air Serbia told them on the phone that reasonable transport, meal, and accommodation costs for the unplanned overnight stay in Belgrade would be compensated.

According to Air Serbia's statement of passenger rights*, the EU Regulation 261/2004 on flight compensation is integrated into Serbian law, so we assume that the passenger is entitled not only to the costs for the stay in Belgrade, but also €250 in compensation for the cancelled flight.

The passenger accordingly made a claim for compensation (both the overnight expenses and the €250 cancellation award) using Air Serbia's online form*, including all the relevant travel information and documentation (receipts, etc.).  Air Serbia just now rejected the claim as follows:


  Thank you for your patience while the claim relating to your journey from BEG to PRG on 14.3.2020 was processed.
  
  After carefully reviewing your claim, I regret to inform you that we are not able to provide compensation in this case. This decision was reached taking into account the specific circumstances of your case, due to the coronavirus pandemic. Please note that the decision is final.
  
  We’re sorry that our service on 14.3.2020 did not meet your expectations and hope that we can look forward to welcoming you on-board an Air Serbia flight in the future.


We are skeptical about this rejection for the following reasons:


On the phone, Air Serbia had already promised compensation at least for the transport, accommodation, and meals in Belgrade.
Air Serbia cancelled the flight before the governments of Serbia and Austria had imposed any restrictions on foreign travel relating to the coronavirus pandemic.
At no time before now had Air Serbia indicated that the cancellation was due to the pandemic.
According to the answer to another Covid-19–related question here (May I get a refund for a flight cancelled because of COVID-19?), ""under EU rules you always get a refund"".


We would therefore like answers to the following:


Under Serbian or EU law (whichever is applicable in our case), is the passenger in fact entitled to compensation in this case?
If the answer to the previous question is ""yes"", then to what enforcement body can the passenger appeal Air Serbia's final decision?  The EU helpfully provides a list of national enforcement bodies for EC 261/2004, but Serbia is not on this list.  If there's no national enforcement body in Serbia, can the passenger appeal to the one in Austria, given that she bought the ticket and is resident there?




* Note that due to Air Serbia's broken website, you may need to follow that link twice before the correct page appears.  It seems that first-time visitors to the website are always redirected to its home page.
","the eur250 compensation does not apply in extraordinary circumstances beyond the airline is control. while it is not certain that this applies, it is highly likely now during covid-19.  however, extra expenses  accommodation, food  are to be reimbursed, per article 9 of the ec261 regulation.  so contact them again and mention this  of course, attach the receipts . tell them that article 9 of ec261 applies regardless of any extraordinary circumstances.  and if you want to be dead certain if extraordinary cirumstances apply or not  i.e. whether or not the eur250 compensation is due , ask a firm such as claimcompass to investigate it. it costs nothing, and they have sophisticated resources for checking things, but if they find compensation is due, they will keep 35  of the amount for themselves.

"Apparently, a new coronavirus related paid family leave law takes effect on 04/01/2020. I understand that, among commercial companies, it applies only to those under 500 employees (because, of course, companies that can afford lobbying cannot be burdened, but that's unrelated to the question.) The questions I have regarding that law:

1) Does the new extended leave law apply to federal employees? More specifically, my wife works for Veterans' Affairs, and we'd like to figure out whether she qualifies. On one hand, VA has more than 500 employees, but on the other hand, VA is not a commercial company, and I don't see in the reports specifics regarding the government employees.

2) Would a mother of small children qualify for paid family leave to watch them while the schools are closed? This has become quite an issue as soon as the schools closed for the year.
","the department of labor has a page about the law. some excerpts  boldface mine :    most employees of the federal government are covered by title ii of the family and medical leave act, which was not amended by this act, and are therefore not covered by the expanded family and medical leave provisions of the ffcra. however, federal employees covered by title ii of the family and medical leave act are covered by the paid sick leave provision.    and as to your question 2:    generally, the act provides that employees of covered employers are eligible for:    two weeks  up to 80 hours  of paid sick leave at two-thirds the employee is regular rate of pay because the employee is unable to work because of a bona fide need to care for an individual subject to quarantine  pursuant to federal, state, or local government order or advice of a health care provider , or to care for a child  under 18 years of age  whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to covid-19, and/or the employee is experiencing a substantially similar condition as specified by the secretary of health and human services, in consultation with the secretaries of the treasury and labor  and    up to an additional 10 weeks of paid expanded family and medical leave at two-thirds the employee is regular rate of pay where an employee, who has been employed for at least 30 calendar days, is unable to work due to a bona fide need for leave to care for a child whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to covid-19.    this page was quite easy to find, just by searching google for the title of the law...

"There's a ridiculous conspiracy theory spreading that coronavirus is a genetically modified biological weapon gone rogue. According to one theory, the virus has traces of HIV and is designed to attack the immune system. My question isn't related to the evidence, which is non-existent, supporting this theory but rather the science behind the claim.

HIV can only spread via blood, semen, pre-seminal fluids, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. Is it even conceivable that an ""HIV like"" virus could spread through the air like coronavirus? The conspiracy theory isn't saying you will get full-blown AIDS but that coronavirus can ""attack the immune system"" (in a way mimicking HIV). I'm not a doctor, but on the surface, the claim that a virus could even somewhat operate like HIV and be airborne sounds absurd.

Several scientists have already said there's no way coronavirus DNA was engineered, but I'm looking for another angle to attack this conspiracy theory.

""There's absolutely nothing in the genome sequence of this virus that indicates the virus was engineered,"" Richard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, told The Washington Post Sunday.

What's the difference between physical distancing and self-isolation?,"as cases of coronavirus surge, health authorities are advising australians to practise physical distancing  also called social distancing  as much as possible to limit transmission. physical distancing is what everyone can do - like staying home - regardless of whether or not they have been exposed to coronavirus. self-isolating or self-quarantining is a more strict and onerous kind of physical distancing - it means cutting yourself off from the outside world.all passengers who arrive in australia are going into mandatory quarantine in hotels for a fortnight. western australia, south australia, queensland, northern territory and tasmania have also essentially closed their borders - any arrivals are required to self-isolate for 14 days.",66
"UK government promises to pay 80% of wages for people unemployed due to coronavirus. I am not economist, so I am probably missing something, but shouldn’t paying wages to unemployed due to coronavirus result in inflation due to decreased products and services created by economy? Is that just a mechanism to redistribute wealth?
","not by itself. the inflation generally depends on the following monetary relation:     mv  py    where m is money supply, v velocity of money  how much one buck is used in economy , p is the price level  change in which is inflation , and y is a real output.  now solving for p so we can focus on inflation gives us:    p  frac mv  y     hence price level  and consequently  increases when money supply increases, velocity of money increases or output decreases.  now let is analyze giving money to those unemployed.   is it newly created money  if not then money supply will not increase. if yes then it would increase inflation rate. redistribution generally does not affect velocity of money much so we can skip that. does this change the output y  well not by much those people are already unemployed. if anything it could increase y as unemployed have probably high marginal propensity to consume so in short run redistribution from a richer person with lower marginal propensity to consume will increase y. especially if this spending was not paid out of higher taxes but from debt.   so a priori as long as it is not financed through printing new money it should not really have effect on inflation. inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon.  also, yes it is a redistribution mechanism like most of the things that uk government does. any policy that uses government funds as a transfer to others, or fund non-public good services  like nhs for example  is a redistributive measure.

"The ""Daily"" NY Times podcast for 3/12/20 described two effective management schemes for handling the epidemic.  Briefly:

Chinese: Check everyone's temperature frequently on a massive scale.  Track individuals with QR codes.  Use a flow chart procedure to confirm or eliminate a COVID hypothesis, and put affected individuals in government quarantine as needed, separating confirmed cases within a family so as to minimize contagion within families.

The flow chart procedure was describe as follows: screen for body temperature and cough. Eliminate bacterial infection and allergy as possible. Cat scan for pneumonia.

Also an NPR report described an online support group led by a social worker that included quarantine graduates who gave descriptions of quarantine living conditions, including food, and gave advice about what to take along to quarantine.  These services apparently helped people cope positively with fears of quarantine.

South Korean: Extensive testing and thorough, meticulous exposure tracing.

My question is, would it be possible to implement one or both of these in the United States (or Europe)?
"," from the helicopter  there is now a more general claim  e.g. in the following mckinsey slide  that western countries are trying to emulate china and/or south korea is response:    the devil might be in the details, of course. getting to the details might be too involved/broad in a question like this, not specific to a pair of countries. there is for example a china-us comparison in a recent bi article, too long to quote here in its entirety, of course. but some things that were probably not done in the west was a complete shutdown of travel, e.g.     these draconian measures seem to have worked to bring down the cases in a very short period of time in china,  yanzhong huang, senior fellow for global health at the council on foreign relations, told business insider.  although there is a cost to the economy, to society, not to mention also the second-order problems, like access to health care for people without the coronavirus. the question is whether the united states is willing to pay such a high price.   ...  huang says he cannot imagine an america where many of these measures are implemented.  ...     during the height of the outbreak, trains did not stop at the disease is epicenter, wuhan.  ...   cutting off transportation was considered on the top three measures to contain the spread of the virus,  huang told business insider.  but it would hard to imagine the complete shutdown of an american city due to government order.    and regarding tracking of people is movement     it would be a big change right for the us people to get accustomed to,  said huang,  if the government wants to use this high tech means, like using the cell phones to monitor the movement of the people.     huang added that even though there is little technological barrier to doing this, this kind of behavior is considered a form of digital authoritarianism, that involves uses privacy issues. huang would be hard-pressed to imagine the us government using this approach to containing the spread of the coronavirus.   china also apparently co-opted every   private   security guard in the effort to keep people in their homes:     in america, you have to stay at home, but there is no police,  said huang.  there is no one actively enforcing that rule, but in china, you have what are basically security guards on patrol of every residence to make sure they do not violate the government containment measures. that is a kind of approach i think can not be copied here in the united states.    likewise for suspending  non-essential  medical access:    in china, elective surgeries and other non-critical doctors visits were delayed, and many medical services were moved online.  ...  but the move has not been without negative consequences. one man with kidney disease in china jumped to his death, human rights watch reported. he could not get dialysis during the outbreak. another boy with cerebral palsy died after being left alone for six days while his father was quarantined in china.    a similar opinion was voiced in a time interview:     no other nation  western or otherwise  can or should seek to replicate china is actions,  thomas bollyky, the director of the global health program at the washington d.c.-based council on foreign relations, tells time via email.  the disregard for civil liberties and human rights that the government has demonstrated in its quarantine and censorship activities are inseparable from the policies and actions of the government that contributed to the outbreak in the first place.    other experts quoted earlier in a science  news  piece were also skeptical that the full extent of china is measures could be copied in the west:    the question now is whether the world can take lessons from china is apparent success--and whether the massive lockdowns and electronic surveillance measures imposed by an authoritarian government would work in other countries.  ...      this report poses difficult questions for all countries currently considering their response to covid-19,  says steven riley, an epidemiologist at imperial college london.  the joint mission was highly productive and gave a unique insight into china is efforts to stem the virus from spread within mainland china and globally,  adds lawrence gostin, a global health law scholar at georgetown university. but gostin warns against applying the model elsewhere.  i think there are very good reasons for countries to hesitate using these kinds of extreme measures.     there is also uncertainty about what the virus, dubbed sars-cov-2, will do in china after the country inevitably lifts some of its strictest control measures and restarts its economy. covid-19 cases may well increase again.   more recent cases from hong kong indicate that that fear of re-emergence may well be have been justified. so hong kong is back into lock down after it was largely lifted at the beginning of march.  similar expert opinion on restrictions timing:    epidemiologists say china is mammoth response had one glaring flaw: it started too late. in the initial weeks of the outbreak in december and january, wuhan authorities were slow to report cases of the mysterious infection, which delayed measures to contain it, says howard markel, a public-health researcher at the university of michigan in ann arbor.  the delay of china to act is probably responsible for this world event,  says markel.    a model simulation by lai shengjie and andrew tatem, emerging-disease researchers at the university of southampton, uk, shows that if china had implemented its control measures a week earlier, it could have prevented 67  of all cases there. implementing the measures 3 weeks earlier, from the beginning of january, would have cut the number of infections to 5  of the total.  ...     but between 16 and 30 january, a period that included the first 7 days of the lockdown, the number of people each infected individual gave the virus to dropped to 1.05, estimates adam kucharski, who models infectious-disease spread at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine.  that was amazing,  he says.  ...      these extreme limitations on population movement have been quite successful,  says michael osterholm, an infectious-disease scientist at the university of minnesota in minneapolis.  ... however,  china is suppressing the virus, not eradicating it, says osterholm. the world will need to wait until about eight weeks after china resumes to some form of normality to know what it did or did not accomplish with its population-movement limitations, he says.    there is probably a fierce debate going on in china about when to relax the lockdown measures, says roy anderson, an epidemiologist at imperial college london. he suggests there could be a second wave of new infections when they are lifted.   so whether it is possible to  fully  emulate china is response  in the west  depends not only on the political framework, but also to which experts the  western  governments might be paying  most  attention to.  i realize this is a long answer already, but there was a recent interview with one of china is  own  cdc officials  whom seldom get interviewed in the west . some interesting points from there:    q: what mistakes are other countries making     a: the big mistake in the u.s. and europe, in my opinion, is that people are not wearing masks.  ...     q: people who tested positive in wuhan but only had mild disease were sent into isolation in large facilities and were not allowed to have visits from family. is this something other countries should consider     a: infected people must be isolated.  ...     q: spread in china has dwindled to a crawl, and the new confirmed cases are mainly people entering the country, correct     a: yes. at the moment, we do not have any local transmission, but the problem for china now is the imported cases. so many infected travelers are coming into china.     more recently  april 2  it has been reported by dw that germany is considering a voluntary phone app similar to the  mandatory   one s  used in china:    the most famous health app was developed by the tech giant alibaba in conjunction with the chinese authorities. other companies have also developed similar software, however. it was possible to work swiftly because the chinese state already has access regarding citizens  movements and programmers did not have to worry about data protection laws.  ...     there are many who hope that germany will soon be using such an app. the health ministry and researchers at the robert koch institute are developing similar software. the idea is to introduce a non-compulsory app that will not be able to detect who met whom and where but will be able to identify if a phone user was in close contact with another infected user.    the app will only really be able to function if 60 percent of the population uses it. in germany, it will not be as easy as in asia to reach such a percentage.    will germans cooperate     half of the respondents to a recent poll said they would not oppose an app to help warn users who had come into contact with someone infected with covid-19.    they do not link to the poll, but i guess in was a poll in germany given that this was an article on dw.  there is now a bbc video discussing chinese-inspired surveillance measures to combat the outbreak. this is of course somewhat subjective, but they only short-listed singapore, israel, iran, taiwan and russia as being closest to china-style surveillance measures used to combat the epidemic, like using cctv cameras and phone tracking.

What about simply testing people to see if they have the virus?,"well, we know it is been a very bumpy start - right  - lots of stories of delays, backlogs, despite promises to expand quickly. now, over the weekend, the fda issued emergency use authorization for a new diagnostic tool. this can provide results within hours rather than days. the company says it is going to make this available - roll this out by march 30th, so end of next week. so this could speed up testing.",24
"Not an economist by far, just a layman, and that's a layman question.

How is this possible that it's difficult to find mask for the Corona Virus? I have been several times to 7/11, boots, Watson, and other pharmacies, and everytime they did not have it as they ran out. How is it possible that the producers of masks give up on additional earning by not producing more masks, now that it's pretty obvious the demand is going up?

The fact that there are not enough masks is my personal experience in Bangkok - however, some friends of mine have the same experience in Italy, where the Corona Virus outbreak has reached a scary stage.

Generally. I would explain capitalism failure by pointing at government regulations - however in this case I don't see how the government can be involved into mask production. 
Any idea? 
","this is a common problem in many domains. for example, there is massive new demand of airbus planes after the boeing 737 max 8 disaster, and their manufacturing capacity is maxed out.  i am familiar with it from the domain of software development, so i will use that as an example.  suppose some website gets mentioned on reddit and the post happens to hit the first page. it gets the  reddit hug of death   the swarm of reddit users overwhelm the website is servers, and it becomes unavailable . you could ask the same question:    how is it possible that the producers of  this site  give up on additional earning by not  spinning up more servers , now that it is pretty obvious the demand is going up    if that  additional earning   of having more of your product available to provide  is less than it costs to permanently over-provision a resource  web servers, mask production factories, etc. , then it is not economical to do so.  cloud infrastructure is becoming incredibly liquid, because resources are very flexible and can be pooled. a high traffic day for my website might be a low traffic day for yours. a cloud provider could scale down your site  saving you money  by uninstalling your software from a server, reassigning that server to me, and use it to scale up my site by installing my software on it  raising my infrastructure costs, but also raising my business  income because it has not gone down . there are even auto-scaling systems that can scale your service up and down in response to current load. there is still some lead time, on the order of a few minutes for web server virtual machines.  the real world is much less flexible than software. if masks are in hot demand, but construction helmets are not, you can not re-purpose the injection molds for hard hats into face-mask stitching machines. there are many factors involved in deciding whether or not its worth in investing to grow the mask manufacturing business:   how many masks are available in reserve  in the warehouses of factories and distributors, in hospitals, in military bases, etc. how long do we think this epidemic will last  will it last long enough to deplete the reserves  is it long-term enough to justify the high up front expenses  how much marginal profit is there to be made in selling these extra masks    interestingly, this problem repeats itself and plays itself out upstream in the supply chain. are the companies that make mask-stitching machines able to produce enough for the new demand  what about their upstream supply chain  ",66

"Japan is currently the nation with the highest debt as a percentage of GDP - at the time of writing it stands at over 250%. Greece, currently the second most indebted nation, went through a decade-long debt crisis after the 2008 financial crash. It entered this crisis with debt levels of 'only' 103% of GDP, and over the entire debt crisis, this only increased to 181% of GDP.

How is Japan able to withstand this level of debt without entering a debt crisis similar to Greece? Is this the right metric to look at, or are there other factors specific to either country?
","their economies are radically different otherwise.   greece has a weak economy in most fields, with the exception of tourism. japan is a manufacturing and scientific powerhouse. greece runs recurring high deficits and had rarely, if ever, shown inclination to stop doing so. while japan was criticized at the start of their financial decline for insisting on balanced budgets instead of stimulating demand. tax collection. japan does it. greece did not. japan could devaluate its currency if necessary to adjust its finances. greece could not, being on the euro. japanese government debt is, i believe, mostly owed to japanese investors and denominated in yen, unlike greece is. japan has demonstrated for decades that it can pay its bills, on its own. greece on the other hand just seemed as if the only thing that kept it up was euro membership. greek official statistics were not, and had not for a while, been trusted. they are still prosecuting the guy who showed they were cooking the books.   until 2008, greece was only getting charged a 0.25  point premium over german bonds based on the tacit assumption that europe  euro-zone  would never let greece go broke. investors, out of greed and risk un-awareness  or trust in european taxpayers gullibility , parked their money in greek bonds, rather than german ones, just to get that extra 0.25  point.  from http://www.bankofgreece.gr/publications/annrep1999.pdf  i find it hard to set hard time limits on google to only look at stuff from before a date :    specifically, the yield differential between the greek and the german 10-year  bond fell from roughly 270 basis points at end-1998 to about 200 basis points in march  1999  see chart vi.1 .   at the start of the general crisis, investors started wondering if trusting that europe would always back greek debt, even when undergoing a europe-wide crisis, was a wise idea. once perception soured, the game was up very quickly. financing costs for greek government debt went up, fast. any refinancing happened at progressively higher rates. a debt that looked bad at the previous, lower, rate seemed like it would result in a short term default. people still loaned to greece, but the premium to do so was massive and made this very quickly unsustainable.  the plug was pulled, late high-rate private and non-european investors got a haircut. europe is taxpayers paid up enough money for greece to keep paying slightly lowered interests, at deferred times, to the big german and french banks so they would not take too massive a loss  and so that loss of confidence would not spread, as per  machavity answer .  most greek debt remained in place, unlike what happens in say an argentinian default. in fact, money  helpfully  loaned to keep greece from defaulting on interest payments just got added to the overall debt. in a way, though it fully deserved the initial mess it got, that is the tragedy of greece. instead of the reset that comes with a default, greeks got this unending misery of servicing a debt which is only pretended to be fully recoverable from  as most of my post is critical, i want to stress that, imho, the greek people do not deserve to live through this for decades .  but no one is too willing to put their hands in that wolf is jaws anymore.  as o.m. says, mostly perception. until covid-19 at least, japan looks like it has a few good years left for investors, most of whom are japanese and have little interest in rocking the boat. this is not to say it is financially healthy, only that it is under less external pressure.  greece relies on foreign money, did not look good in 2008 and does not now. in most other conditions, big chunks of that 181  would have been written off as unrecoverable already.

"I am currently teaching a basic R programming course with about 80 students.
Under normal circumstances,
a core course assessment component is a programming exam,
which is done in the computer lab using the lab computers.
I will arrange for the Internet to be cut off,
and we will have exam invigilators who are patrolling the exam venue
to detect or dissuade students from cheating.
At the end of the exam, the Internet is restored,
and students submit an R script (basically programming code)
using the course learning management system.

This semester, due to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19),
the university where I work has replaced all on-campus teaching activities with online teaching for the entire semester!


With regards to teaching,
the faculty have been asked to teach our classes online using Zoom,
which gives students the freedom to take classes wherever they like.
With regards to exams,
the faculty have been asked to administer their course exams online,
with students completing the exams online from home. (What??!!)


I am very concerned about students taking exams online from home,
because I am worried that some or many of the students may use this as an opportunity to cheat on the exam —
whether it is collaborating with their classmates,
or even asking another student to take the exam in their place.

My questions:


Is there any way to detect if students are cheating (e.g., sharing answers),
when students are doing an online quiz or exam at home?
Is there a way to dissuade students from cheating?


Response to comments:


How much help do you have for these 80 students?

I do have one PhD student who is a grader.
She is supposed to spend about 6 hours a week to help with the course.

","i also teach a data and programming course, though i mainly use python.  is it possible for you to shift grading away from an exam and toward something else  a project, for example  before going back to academia i spent years working as a policy researcher, and exam conditions simply are not a realistic test of real-life coding abilities. for that matter, coding with the internet turned off is also not remotely what real work looks like either.  in my class i like to give a larger project and let them have a few weeks to work on it, but i could also imagine a more simple project that they only have a few days, or even hours, to do. real data work often comes with time constraints, but it does not come with a lack of internet access in exam-like conditions. just scale the scope of the project based on how long you want them to have to work on it.  there is still a huge advantage to knowing the material, rather than having to look it up. you can also grade on the quality of code and correctness of results, and allow for creativity with open-ended questions like  summarize this data with two plots . this way each student is not only tested their knowledge of r, they are tested on their actual ability to use r in a realistic environment.  if you, unfortunately, are required to give an exam, i know there is software available for proctoring online tests. the sort of thing that utilizes their webcams to make sure they do not leave during the test, or consult other devices, or open other web pages. i have not used them though, so i could not make a recommendation. i imagine they all require university subscriptions.

"In the current situation, many people will have to cancel existing flight or hotel bookings, and would like to get a refund.

In which cases can one get a refund?
","there are many specific rules which will vary based on at least:   the country where the property or airline is based the point of departure or the destination of the flight the country where you reside the original cancellation terms of the booking whether you bought flights and hotels separately or not who you bought the flights and/or hotel from whether they were bought as part of group bookings / blocks other specific details.   but, in general, the following apply:   if your flight is cancelled by the airline, then you should in general be eligible for a refund.   for flights covered by the eu flight compensation regulation ec261/2004, i.e. all flights departing from an eu/eea member state or operated by an airline based in an eu/eea member state, this is explicitly stated in article 8 of the regulation.  given that there are exceptional circumstances, no compensation is due. however, you must still be given the option of a refund, though one can accept rerouting or rebooking.  as airlines are cash-strapped, they will try to convince you to take a voucher instead of a refund. you can agree to it if you want, but they cannot force you to do so. remember that many airlines will fail due to this situation. a failed airline cannot honour a voucher or a rebooking  though it is quite probable quite a few will fail before owed refunds are paid .  airlines are required to refund you within 7 days. given the very large number of queries they are receiving at this time, and the precarious financial situation they are in, it will probably take much longer, though, and in many cases any appeal will take enough time for the airline to have failed before you get paid. for other cancelled flights not covered by ec261, the rule should be the same  they could not provide the service, so they should provide a refund , but this will be governed by local laws and/or the airlines terms  amp  conditions  conditions of carriage . note that several other countries implement rules very similar  or even identical  to ec261, including turkey, georgia, moldova, serbia and ukraine. note that you should only ask for the refund if you are at home. if you are stranded in a foreign country, getting a refund may complicate things a lot to secure alternate travel. though ec261 requires the airline to provide both the refund and a return flight  at the earliest opportunity , in many cases the return flight you want may not be operated by the airline but via some other scheme.  if however your flight has not  yet  been cancelled, and you decide to change your plans, then you do not have the right to a full refund  unless the fare was fully refundable, of course . in theory, the original terms of your fare should apply  including fares being non-refundable, penalties, etc. . most airlines will however offer to either rebook for free or provide a voucher valid for future travel  usually valid for a year . note that in many cases, the rebooking options or voucher validity will be limited to one year from the original purchase date. i doubt any will offer a refund in this case.  this applies also if you change your plans because the situation at the destination is no longer suitable, or you will not be able to get to your hotel, or the conference or event you were planning to attend has been cancelled, or you are stuck in yet another country due to the current travel restrictions, etc. as long as it is not the airline cancelling the flight, no refunds are due. the case of countries suddenly closing their borders to some categories of people  e.g. the us refusing entry to anyone having gone through the schengen area, uk, or ireland in the past 14 days  probably falls in the last category: as long as the flight still operates, the airline usually is not required to provide a refund. airlines will often proactively suggest you rebook your travel or get a voucher. once you have accepted that option, you are no longer eligible for a refund even if the flight you originally booked ends up being cancelled. for hotels, the rules are basically the same, though i am not aware of any blanket legislation like ec261:   if the hotel cancels the booking  because they will be closed or completely inaccessible , you should in general be eligible for a refund, even if the fare was non-refundable. if the hotel is still able to honour your booking, but you just can not get there  because there are no flights, borders are closed, you are stuck in another country, region or city  or no longer want to get there  you no longer want to travel, the event you wanted to attend has been cancelled... , then you are in general not eligible for a refund.  here again, the hotel may apply the original rules of the booking  no refunds or changes at all , or they can  and many will  allow for a rebooking at a later date or a voucher. but ultimately, that is their choice.  travel booked as a  package   flight   hotel, sometimes other components as well  sold by a travel agent or tour operator usually have additional protections, especially those sold by eu companies. most importantly, if the flight is cancelled or the hotel at the destination is unreachable/closed, one is eligible for a refund of the whole package, whereas when both are booked separately, one may be able to get a refund for one but not the other. added 18/3/2020 in some places, the government has changed the rules, and explicitly authorises some actors to not refund, and instead only provide a voucher valid for one year. see this answer for belgium for such an exemple.   let is add that this is were travel insurance should come into play, but double-check any exclusions and conditions that may apply. also, do not forget that you may have multiple travel insurances: many credit cards have a travel insurance automatically included for all travel bought using the card. check the conditions and exclusions of any that may apply  you can of course only get refunded by a single one .

I wonder why these tests are so different and can't find proper information on what which country is testing for. 
","first of all the disclaimer: i am analytical chemist but not clinical chemist. that is, i professionally do things that are related/to some extent similar to test kit development, but not for medical use, and i have only been very remotely involved with microbiology-related testing. otoh, i expect that pretty much everyone who works in this field is likely to work a lot these days and not to have any time to hang out on sx.  so this is all afaik, and i am happy be corrected - and op please take this with the appropriate caution against stuff written in the internet by random strangers.   the tests are developed in much haste, and undergo some emergency validation rather than the full validation procedure that is usually required. this naturally leads to some uncertainty about their performance, but we accept that in order to have tests available at all right now. see e.g. what the fda says about covid tests  list with fda emergency use approved covid tests.  different tests search for different parts of the virus rna.  this is getting very far from my field, but is this the information you are looking for as what exctly is tested  by the cdc-developed test    viruses mutate, so a test that works well at some place at one time may not work as well somewhere else or a few weeks or months later.  for a test to work,    sampling  possibly transport extraction from the sample  difficulty varies e.g. between mouth swabs and sputum  the test kit    must all work well. e.g. if the sampling is not done properly because there is no properly trained staff available, nothing can be done further down the analytic process. i do not know why the indonesian tests do not work, but it may be as  simple  as samples undergoing long transportation to a lab with the appropriate equipment so they spoil on the way. the faulty tests in the us seem to have had a wrong reagent - and burocratic approval was needed for the labs to replace that by their own good reagents.  usually, if a lab wants to use other than the prescribed/delivered reagent, they need to a lengthy validation of the procedure - the point here is to be allowed to avoid that as it would take too long   ",66
"I live in a fairly desirable area with one drawback: my apartment overlooks a multi-lane restricted access parkway. I'd prefer not to say more for privacy reasons. Until recently, it's been only a minor annoyance.

But since things have been locked down due to the coronavirus outbreak, I've been spending a lot more time at home, and the traffic on the parkway has gotten lighter, meaning that at least anecdotally speeds have increased. The result is a huge increase in infrasound. It's like my whole apartment is shaking all day.

I'm obviously not expecting the state to shut down traffic on the road completely for my comfort. It does seem like a reasonable expectation that the people driving on a roadway should get at least close to the legal speed limit, however. The posted speed on the road is 30 miles per hour, while drivers routinely flout this going 60 or 70 miles per hour.

I've already tried writing to my city government, who referred me to a state agency who hasn't written back. I've also contacted the person who represents me in my state legislature. His office too has not written back to me.

What's the most effective way to get my argument to a decision maker? Would I be better served addressing this complaint to the police department with jurisdiction over the roadway? Would I be better served organizing my neighbors and then returning to my state legislator with more of a coalition?

(I live in Boston, Massachusetts.)
","i see that this question has been migrated from politics.se, but i would argue that is the better forum for this question. we are talking about finding a way to enforce the law, but the options available to you are pretty solidly in the political category.  what you are doing is probably the best way to go. the state government is unlikely to do much, so stay on top of your local government.  communicate directly with the police, as many departments will make a point of setting up patrols in areas where they get complaints.   on top of that, get as many people as you can to support your cause. the more noise they make, the harder it is for the government to ignore the problem. circulate petitions, make calls, etc.  at the same time, keep in mind that this problem is a side effect of an emergency situation that is causing all sorts of problems that make yours look trivial by comparison. do not be surprised if emergency personnel conclude that this is too low priority to address, even if it is remarkably inconvenient to you personally.

"In 2019 I booked a flight ticket with SAS to Svalbard. Unfortunately Covid19 happened.

My ticket is from a flight outside the nordic countries, with a layover in Oslo.

I'll be prevented from entering Norway, since I'm not a resident. Moreover, even if I was already in Norway right now, I'd be prevented from boarding the flight from Oslo to Longyearbyen, since Svalbard  also separately restricted travel.

To add to the complexity, when I tried to book this ticket, SAS doesn't offer a flight with a single layover. All of the flights I found have a further layover in Stavanger, Stockholm, Copenhagen... even if SAS offers direct flights to Oslo! The solution I found was to book with a travel agent which sold me a ticket with a single layover.

So, SAS has a page for Covid19 information, with links to a search tool (a bit buggy and annoying to use) to check cancelled and confirmed flights, I haven't been able to confirm it for sure, but the closer we are to the departure date (it's less than 10 days from now), it seems that the less likely it'll be for it to be cancelled.

I have the option of REBOOKING FREE OF CHARGE, unfortunately The rebooking can be made only once. and due to the current uncertainty, it's really difficult to pick another sensible date on which to plan my trip (no idea when Norway and Svalbard will reopen to visitors).

In theory, I have the option to exchange my flight ticket for a voucher, that way I'd have the option to defer choosing the new date, which would suit me much better. Unfortunately The voucher is valid for bookings made directly with SAS (not for bookings made by travel agents).

I already contacted my travel agent 6 days ago. They ask not to call, and contact them via their ticketing system only for trips in the next 4 weeks. Unfortunately, both messages I sent them have been replied with an automated reply which suggests to call them on the phone (phone which only has a recorded message, saying that they are unable to take calls due to the huge volume of requests).

So, it seems that I'm stuck. I was thinking that given that in normal circumstances I have right to travel to norway (being an EEA citizen), if I'm denied boarding I should be able to at least hope for compensation according to EU regulation 261.  Though it seems there's an exception  For safety, security or health reasons, which usually is for different kinds of concerns, but it might be applied to a blanket ban on non-residents due to Covid19.
Regardless if that exception happens, I'd have to actually attempt boarding (be at the airport on time) to actually claim compensation. I could do that, but that seems less than ideal:


I'm social distancing, and I'd rather avoid a needless trip to the airport
As described above, I don't know if I should realistically expect compensation (maybe you can help me here)
I'd have to hope that the airline would really not let me board (given that I'd then be stuck in Norway without a flight to come back immediately), though I guess I can go past the gate and then turn back before entering the plane.


I guess that if the worst thing that happens to me during this pandemic is that I'll lose out on the money for this flight ticket, that's still pretty good, all things considered. Before giving up on it though, maybe you have some suggestion on how to able to be refunded?
","if someone has an answer to the general question, that is still welcome, but to provide an update on my specific situation:  it seems that things will resolve for the best: the airline ended up cancelling the flight, and the travel agent wrote me that they will go ahead with the refund process.  i have actually only received automated emails from the agent, and i have been unable to speak with anyone. otoh i have actually been able to speak with someone from the airline, so this experience is persuading me to try even harder in the future to avoid booking via a travel agent.

How do I safely take care of someone who’s sick?,"with the shortage of coronavirus testing nationwide, it may be difficult to know whether your loved one has coronavirus or another illness.  so it is critical to play it safe and not infect yourself and, in turn, others. the cdc suggests:     giving the sick person their own room to stay in, if possible. keep the door closed.  having only one person serve as the caretaker.  asking the sick person to wear a face mask, if they are able to. if the mask causes breathing difficulties, then the caretaker should wear a mask instead.",67
"I am in the process of making an offer for a house. Wife and I have about 135K saved, with steady jobs, both happen to be an 'essential business' as required for this period during the corona virus.

Initially, I wanted to put 20% down (about 74K) to avoid PMI and have lower monthly payments.

I have since reversed course on this. I think 10% (about 37K) is better, and here is my reasoning. PMI calculators online suggest the PMI will be about 150 a month. 37K invested returns should be more than double the yearly PMI payments during an average year. We plan on being in this house for the foreseeable future, so I am playing the long game with this chunk of investment. We can also have the option to make a chunk payment in the future to bring it to 20% equity and get the PMI taken off if we choose. Also, this gives us access to this cash in a more liquid form during these unsure times.

Does this reasoning make sense? With a long term outlook, would it still be wise to sink the extra 37K into the house and get rid of the PMI?
","short answer:  it probably makes sense to avoid the pmi  private mortgage insurance , but it ultimately depends on how probable it is that you are unable to pay the monthly installments with/without the extra savings.   long answer: while i am not an expert on the specifics of the us mortgage market  i presume the question pertains to us , it seems that a pmi  or an increment of the overall interest rate charged on the loan  varies between 0.5  and 2  p.a. and is charged on the overall loan amount  90  in this case . your loan amount works out to 333k from the provided information and your annual pmi payment to 1800. this puts it on the lower end with 0.54 .   that means that with the 37k you plan to invest instead of paying down, you have to earn 4.9  p.a. plus the normal mortgage interest rate on those 37k - all this net of tax  assuming you get no tax deduction on your mortgage/pmi payments . this seems like a tall order compared to a  risk-free  savings you realize by having a lower mortgage interest rate on the overall loan amount without the pmi. so based on risk/return considerations alone, you are probably better off avoiding the pmi. only a very low pmi rate would result a different outcome from that perspective.  another consideration to make is whether putting the 37k aside instead of using them for a down payment would improve your worst-case scenario and could buy you additional time in case you have difficulties repaying the mortgage. only you can figure out how much this  option  is worth, considering how secure your and your spouse is incomes are, what are you going to do with the 61k that remain even if you choose to pay down and how much the monthly mortgage repayment is, compared to your income. based on the information you provided, it seems that the 61k can last you for a significant period of mortgage repayments, so that the value of any additional cushion is probably very small.

"FactCheck.org considers Trumps claim that he inherited a broken CDC system to be 'misleading', and has given a long description of why they  made that ruling.  It effectively boils down to the claim that the CDC was never intended to be the sole producer of tests.  Instead they claim that the CDC was always intended to work with third parties and private sector to support the production of tests and other resources if a pandemic happened, and that the delays with testing was due to the CDC not allowing private sector agencies to build tests originally.

If it's true that the intent of the CDC was to support/regulate private sector test development, and that the CDC failed to do that, then the next question is why didn't it?  Why did the CDC not immediately open up production of tests to the private sector and support and vet those tests as factcheck.org claims was the original design intent?

Is there a specific individual or group of individuals who had the ability to decide to open up testing to private sector and failed to do it?  Was Trump or the white house in any way responsible for this decision to not open up testing to the private sector?
","shorter answer: the departments of the cdc, fda, and hhs all are under the direction and guidance of the trump administration. failures of any one of these departments is the direct responsibility of the president. parsing which department is most responsible for failure to immediately mobilize and deploy mass testing, while interesting, is an exercise in searching for a scapegoat.

I have been following recent developments in DIY ventilator design, which are normally focussed on a contraption to send positive pressure in a controlled cycle. The counterargument against these initiatives is that modern ventilators are complex and do, among other things, aspiration of liquid from the lungs because patients are intubated. Intubation itself requires sedation for long periods, which brings it's own problems.  

Why is such intubation necessary. Why not have a well-sealed mask? 
","when patients have respiratory problems due to low oxygen saturation then you can supplement the o2 of room air by using high flow oxygen at various concentrations above room air using nasal cannulae or masks such as a hudson mask.  when they are unable to maintain adequate oxygenation levels with a mask, and/or suffering respiratory muscle fatigue, they are then placed on a mechanical ventilator. the cuff on the intubation tube is to stop secretions falling back into the lung causing aspiration pneumonia as usually at this stage the patient is no longer able to protect their own airways.   some people have tried cpap devices to supply air under pressure but that has the potential disadvantage of aerosolizing virus into the environment    while that measure could stretch the supply of ventilators and save lives, it has a major drawback. officials and scientists have known for years that when used with a face mask, such alternative devices can possibly increase the spread of infectious disease by aerosolizing the virus, whether used in the hospital or at home.    indeed, that very scenario may have contributed to the spread of covid-19 within a washington state nursing home that became ground zero in the united states. first responders called to the life care center of kirkland starting feb. 24 initially used positive airway pressure machines, often known as cpaps, to treat residents before it was known the patients were infected with covid-19.   http://edu.cdhb.health.nz/hospitals-services/health-professionals/netp/documents/oxygen 20therapy 20- 20rommel 20principe 2019 20april 202016.pdf  http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/27/822211604/cpap-machines-were-seen-as-ventilator-alternatives-but-could-spread-covid-19 ",66

"After last minute, party-line decisions by the US and Wisconsin Supreme Courts, Wisconsin will hold their presidential primary and a hotly-contested Supreme Court election tomorrow (April 7th) despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The state's Democratic governor has been pushing to delay the election and/or extend the window for absentee ballot collection, but the Republican controlled legislature have opposed both moves. 

In addition to the the potential for voters to get infected while voting, the vast majority of polling sites have been closed due to a lack of volunteers (most of whom are usually retirees) to run them:


  The state has faced serious questions about its ability to run an election amid the pandemic. With poll workers quitting out of fears of contracting the virus, more than 100 municipalities have said they lack enough staff to run even one polling place.
  
  Milwaukee typically has about 180 sites; this election the city plans to have five open. The head of the state elections commission raised the possibility in court testimony that some voters may have to head to a different town on Election Day because no one will be staffing the polls in their hometowns.
  
  Wisconsin Is Set to Vote on Tuesday After Court Overrules Governor’s Postponement - The New York Times


Why is the state Republican party insisting on going forward with an election where most people will be unable to vote, even if they're willing to risk their lives and health to do so? Even if they don't consider the threat of COVID-19 to be significant, the closure of so many polling places guarantees that people will be denied the opportunity to vote.
","rural voters are not afraid to go to the polls to keep a conservative state supreme court justice in power.  the april 2020 ballot does include the u.s. presidential primary, but that will have little effect on state politics. after i first posted this answer, the new york times echoed many of the points i make below, starting with:    former vice president joseph r. biden jr. and senator bernie sanders are on the ballot in wisconsin, but the main event is the state supreme court race between the conservative incumbent justice, daniel kelly, and a liberal challenger, jill karofsky.   wisconsin has an elected state supreme court that currently has 5 conservatives and 2 liberals. one of the conservatives  daniel kelly  is up for election in april 2020, and the another conservative is up in the next election after that  pat rogensack, 2023 . if liberals win both of those seats back, they would have a 4-3 majority and could undo the laws that keep the minority republican party in power.    the election determined the size of the court is conservative majority. a win for karofsky would have reduced the conservative majority to 4-3, meaning that the next regularly scheduled election in 2023 would decide control of the court. a kelly win would have preserved the court is 5-2 conservative majority.    ballotpedia   it is helpful to understand the political context:   for decades prior to 2010, wisconsin was a moderate state. the legislature and governorship each frequently flipped between the democratic and republican parties. since 1900, wisconsin has equally chosen republicans and democrats for president. justices on the state supreme court are elected and technically nonpartisan. nonetheless, their conservative versus liberal ideology are often clear. for decades prior to 2010, the state supreme court held a liberal majority. it is worth mentioning that long ago, wisconsin republicans were leaders in open elections and progressive ideas. the republican party started in wisconsin, as an anti-slavery party  later to be re-started in michigan . the word  progressive  was coined by republican robert la follette. wisconsin was the first or among the first states to adopt women is suffrage, open ballots, primary elections, recall elections, referenda, outlawing child labor, worker is compensation, and income taxes  all were progressive republican measures. prior to the tea party, the state was considered one of the most bipartisan and least corrupt states. led primarily by tea party candidates, in the fall 2010 election, wisconsin republicans won control of all three branches of government. this included the election of scott walker as governor, a one-seat majority in the state senate, a considerable margin in the state assembly, and a 4 to 3 majority in the state supreme court. republicans quickly enacted a series of laws that would lock in their party is control:   using sophisticated computer models to draw election maps for the u.s. house, state senate, and state assembly to maximize republican seats and to pack democratic votes into few districts. the gerrymandering is so successful that in the 2018 elections, republicans won 5 of 8 u.s. house seats with only 45.61  of votes, and 63 of 99 state assembly seats with only 44.75  of votes. adopting a voter-id law. minorities and the poor -- who tend to vote for democrats -- are less likely to have the proper types of identification. purged 234,000 voters from voting rolls. requiring early voting to be performed only at the municipal clerk is office, and not multiple sites. thus the 600,000 residents of milwaukee  a democratic stronghold  had only one site for early voting, the same as a town of 600 people would. this law was struck down by a federal judge in 2016.      a requirement that cities can have only one place for early voting. critics have said large cities such as milwaukee should be able to have multiple voting sites because not everyone can get downtown easily.    limiting the days and hours for early and absentee voting. replacing the agency which oversees elections, from the government accountability board composed of judges chosen by other judges, to the wisconsin election commission chosen by politicians. moving the state supreme court elections from the fall  which have high democratic turnout  to the spring  which have poor democratic turnout . this has been particularly effective at increasing the conservative control of the court, from 3-4 in 2010 to 7-2 in 2020. note how the election during the pandemic is a spring election, with a supreme court contest. holding special elections to fill vacancies on unusual dates -- when republicans turn out -- instead of the usual fall and spring election dates when democrats turn out. after a series of failed recall elections for the governor and republicans in the state senate, changes that made recalls more difficult  2015 act 117 . a series of laws  most famously 2011 act 10  to cripple the power and finances of labor unions, which are the primary backers of democratic candidates. in 2015, changing the chief justice position from the most senior justice  a liberal  to being chosen by a majority of the court  conservatives . in 2015, stripping the powers of the democratic secretary of state. increasing the powers of the republican governor and attorney general. when democrats won back these offices in 2018, the powers of those offices were reduced in a lame duck session.  the conservatives controlling the state supreme court have upheld most of the laws described above. this includes laws that affected the justices  own re-election. in particular, the decision specifically about whether to continue the election during the pandemic went along ideological lines. moderate republicans were treated poorly by the dominant tea party faction. the previous republican leaders of the legislature -- dave schultz in the assembly and mike ellis in the senate -- were pushed out of leadership by tea party leaders. schultz would later testify in a gerrymandering case that republicans were brought one-by-one to a law office, and were ordered to vote for the gerrymandered maps, else their own districts would be gerrymandered to make them lose. in the ensuing years, many moderate republicans quit the party in disgust, and many moderate office-holders were voted out in primaries by tea party candidates. the loss of moderates had drained the support of the republican party. since 2010, democrats have been gaining ground. by number of voters statewide, the republican party is actually a minority party in wisconsin. wisconsin is top republican even admitted that they are not the majority:    after the republican robin vos, the speaker of the wisconsin statehouse, said that  if you took madison and milwaukee out of the state election formula, we would have a clear majority.    however, the measures described above are so effective that the state supreme court and both houses of the state legislature still remain in republican control. democrats swept every statewide office in 2018: u.s. senate, governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, and treasurer. they had more votes in the u.s. house, but because of gerrymandering, they won only 3 of 8 seats. they also had more votes in the state assembly and gained one seat, but again because of gerrymandering, they did not gain control. as has happened nationwide, the wisconsin republican party has aligned with rural interests and and the democratic party with urban interests. covid-19 is likely to keep people in high-density  i.e. democratic  districts at home. like other rural places in the u.s., rural wisconsinites believe that covid-19 is a  big city  phenomenon and are likely to show up to the polls. per the new york times, about one of the least populous counties:    bruce johnson, the democratic chairman in pepin county, along the state is western border with minnesota, said he pushed for absentee balloting but people were less concerned because they rarely wait in lines to vote.   wikipedia:    when the election went ahead on 7 april, access to easy in-person voting heavily depended on where voters were located. in smaller or more rural communities, which tend to be whiter and vote republican, few issues were reported.   it is therefore in the interest of republicans to keep the election going during the pandemic. should liberals take back the state supreme court, they can overturn the system of laws which keeps the republican party in power. they would then be at the mercy of the voters, who have been increasingly voting democratic.

"I am building my first road bike. I have been an avid biker rider for quite sometime and always thought about getting a road bike, just never got around to it.

Fast forward to now, my neighbor (pro rider) threw his Scott CR1 carbon fiber frame in the dumpster along with a MOST carbon handlebar and Cosmic wheel set.  Now that I acquired all this stuff for free, time to finally build a bike!

My point of this post is first to get some advice on ... where to start? How do I find out what is compatible to this bike from a component group, to putting everything together etc.

I know I won't be able to do everything but I know I can get pretty far then I am planning on taking it to a local guy to do a tuneup before I get her out on the road.

I want to build as tough and reliable as possible on a budget (don't want to spend a ton but want a quality bike). Let me know if anyone can help out with where to get started, also if you have parts for sale or anything or want to trade for something, I am wide open to that as well. Picture is attached, let me know what year as well if anyone knows. 

Thanks David


"," this frame is about 10 years old  the model was sold for a few years . there is a chance that there is a crack in the carbon fiber, which would be cause for concern. there are services that will perform non-destructive testing, and there are ways to perform inspections at home with somewhat less reliability, but that would be my first concern. it looks like the bottom bracket is intact. if the bearings turn smoothly, keep them. if not, you will want to replace them, which would probably be the most complex part of your build. it looks like this bike takes a pf86 bottom bracket  there are numerous standards . this bike was sold with a shimano 105 group  possibly other groups as well . 105 has good performance and good value, so you will not go wrong with that. you will obviously need caliper brakes, not disk, but that is about the only requirement from the options that will be available to you. it looks like it has a front derailleur braze-on, so you will need to make sure you get a compatible derailleur. there are a lot of other options that will be matters of personal taste. crankarm length, chainring tooth counts, cassette tooth counts, saddle, pedals, bar tape color, etc. this is not a marketplace or swap meet, so not a good place to find the parts you will need.

"In one of the answers to another question about the corona virus a link was given to this phylogenetic analysis of the virus.

Can somebody assist a non-bio type here? It seems to show that the current corona virus split from a virus in bats. And that the same ancestral virus is also ancestral to several other viruses, some in humans and some in bats. 

Is my understanding basically correct?
","overview the central focus of the tree is to highlight the key biological concern of the new coronavirus, 2019-ncov. the key concern is the genetic similarities to sars epidemic, and relates to the sars receptor.   sars background sars is endemic in bats  your biorxiv tree partly shows that and this tree definitely shows it  and in the 2002 epidemic infected civet cats which then infected humans. more importantly it is then transmitted from one human to another. this is a consequence of the sars receptor been able to exploit the cellular receptors in the respiratory tract of bats, civet cats and humans and use this tissue as a site of replication. the concern is exacerbated because the tree here shows sars independently infected humans on two separate occasions, suggesting the cross-over has an underlying genetic basis, which is part of the  sars lineage .  biorxiv 2019-ncov tree your tree shows the 2019-ncov has a recent common ancestor with sars in comparison to the rest of the betacoronaviruses. this therefore provides some circumstantial evidence the receptor mechanism and ability to frequently crossover from bats and ultimately transmit human to human could be shared with sars. at an evolutionary level  which is what any tree is supposed to reconstruct  it raises the question which common ancestor of sars did the  sars receptor  originate. i would need to draw a diagram to better demonstrate this point, but i hope you get the idea.  the  influenza receptor  the analogy is with influenza virus and the entire epidemiology of influenza hinges around is sialic acid receptor of influenza and its ability to bind on to the cellular receptors in the upper/lower respiratory tract of birds, pigs and humans. the hypothesised mechanism is called the mixing vessel theory and is the classic epidemiological understanding of how new pathogenic influenza pandemics occur. if you replace  birds and pigs  with e.g.  bats, civet cats and humans  you get the idea why this could be scary. we do not the intemediate host of 2019-ncov ... but i speculate there must be one, unless eating cov-infected bats is common in china.  technical details of the biorxiv tree the tree is a nicely diverse selection of the beta-coronaviruses. the authors have rooted the tree using the outgroups of delacoronaviruses and gammacoronaviruses, so it is a good robust selection of outgroups which can be used to correctly identify the direct of evolution of betacoronavirus divergence. in tree theory  its formal name is phylogenetics theory , extensive rooting is good and minimises artefacts.  one of the earliest members of the betacoronaviruses to diverge is mers  middle eastern respiratory syndrome , which form a single  clade   all viruses share a unique common ancestor  and these represent around 50  amino acid divergence from sars/2019-ncov. the selection of mers in the tree from both camels and humans looks good. the selection of other betacoronaviruses looks great, i was not aware of the  ruminant clade  at all involving buffalo, cow etc .. infections and there was an associated human infection. there are loads of bat isolates of the betacoronaviruses throughout the tree, but we eventually arrive at the  sars clade . the authors show that 2019-ncov is an outgroup to the sars clade and shows a close relationship to one  biorxiv tree  or two  this tree  bat isolates. looking at the precise sars clade  better shown in this tree  we can see loads of bat virus associating with sars lineages. we therefore assume the reservoir to sars and likely 2019-ncov is bat, moreover that the single ancestor to both viruses was a bat  it is called a parsimonious hypothesis .   the one thing the biorxiv tree omits, for example with regards this tree, is the diversity of sars and in particularly the two independent origins of sars, which is a weakness of their analysis, particular if this fed into downstream analysis. it is not to say the authors were wrong, but it was uncool.   word of caution my understanding is the divergence between sars and 2010-ncov is around 15  and this is a quite a large amount of genetic divergence, even if both viruses share a most recent common-ancestor, form part of the same clade and receptor peptide motifs. nevertheless there is sufficient amino acid divergence to generate notable differences in epidemiology, clinical symptom and transmission.   mers, sars and 2019-ncov mortality rates it is worth noting that within the betacoronaviruses the mortality rates between difference clinically important viruses is very different. mers has a mortality rate of 40-60 , sars is around 10  but 2019-ncov is  lt 2.5 . the 2019-ncov mortality rate is still important given it has infected more and could potentially infect alot more people than sars. ",118
How it spreads,"how it spreads most spread is from droplets produced when an infected person coughs, which are inhaled by people nearby. transmission from touching contaminated surfaces has not been shown yet, though recent tests by us scientists suggest it is possible -- one reason they recommend washing your hands and not touching your face. the virus can live in the air for several hours, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. cleaning surfaces with solutions containing diluted bleach should kill it.  while we are still learning about the biology of this virus, it does not appear that there is a major risk of spread through sweat,  said julie fischer, a georgetown university microbiologist. the biggest concern about going to the gym is infected people coughing on others, or contaminating shared surfaces or equipment, she said. consider avoiding large classes and peak hours and do not go if you are coughing or feverish, she suggests. the risk of virus transmission from food servers is the same risk as transmission from other infected people, but  one of the concerns in that food servers, like others facing stark choices about insurance and paychecks, may be pressured to work even if they are sick,  she said.",148
"Because ACE2 is used by SARS-NCoV-2 to enter the cell, I am curious what factors determine its expression.  Interestingly, myocardial infarction increases ACE2 expression in the heart in an animal model ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15671045 ).  The paper found no significant effect from ramipril, an ACE inhibitor, but I don't think I can assume ARBs would work the same way.  (I am suspicious they might increase it based on the increase in the product Ang(1-7) level - https://www.nature.com/articles/hr200974 )  Note that soluble sACE2 can bind cells that did not produce it, by an RGD independent association with integrin beta 1.

","let is not get ahead of ourselves here.. chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine  and possibly in concert with azithromycin  have been touted over the past few days as a possible treatment regimen.  and there is some cause for that - the antiviral properties of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in vitro are broad and it is been trialed against various things  hiv, ebola etc , however this has not always transferred particularly well into an actual treatment. and there is some research suggesting that it can successfully battle sars-cov-2 in vitro too. however, killing something in a petri dish is one thing, treating a disease in a human is another.  there has been some preliminary trials done - i believe there is been some fairly non-specific vagueness about it being promising when used in china and there is a relatively new study that is come from gautret et al in france.  the gautret et al paper looks promising - on the surface. it seems to suggest that treating people with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin looks great:    unfortunately though it is not that simple.. first up we are not talking about a great number of people here. the entire study comprised 42 patients  16 of which were the control , which is not a huge sample size. and any patients who were on the treatment who got worse were removed from the analysis:    six hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were lost in follow-up during the survey because of early cessation of treatment. reasons are as follows: three patients were transferred to intensive care unit, including one transferred on day2 post-inclusion who was pcr-positive on day1, one transferred on day3 post-inclusion who was pcr-positive on days1-2 and one transferred on day4 post-inclusion who was pcr- positive on day1 and day3  one patient died on day3 post inclusion and was pcr-negative on day2  one patient decided to leave the hospital on day3 post-inclusion and was pcr-negative on days1-2  finally, one patient stopped the treatment on day3 post-inclusion because of nausea and was pcr-positive on days1-2-3.    so the picture is not quite as rosy as the graph makes it look. some people on this treatment still got worse, one died.  it get is even shonkier  technical term  when you look at the large swathes of control patients who did not have the pcr test done for viral loads:    they effectively only properly measured the viral loads for 4 of the 16 control patients, so trying to compare the groups is verging on meaningless.  so before we look at  when  they will be widely available to treat sars-cov-2 i would be more concerned with answering whether they should be used to treat it. hydroxychloroquine is not exactly harmless - while less toxic to humans than chloroquine, it is not something to give lightly, it can have immunosuppressant effects, and in sufficient dosages can result in potentially lethal cardiotoxicity.  it may yet prove to be an effective treatment - and the who is trialing it  along with other potential treatments  as part of their mega-trial solidarity, but let is not get too excited just yet.

How long does coronavirus last?,"if you get coronavirus it takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, scientists have said, but some people will get symptoms much later than this.  so we do not know that information for everyone, but it seems to be like a few weeks on average, something like that,  dr xand said.  people can be very ill for a few weeks and then they gradually get better,  he added. the uk government has said it wants everybody to stop going outside if they can to stop the virus spreading. but it especially wants people to self-isolate if they have symptoms. as virus expert, dr jake dunning, explained, it basically means staying at home so the virus can not spread to other people. it also means other people can not come round to visit you while you are self-isolating. according to medical experts, 99  of people will make a full recovery, as their immune system eventually defeats the virus.",55
"We all hear about the massive fluctuations of the stock market due to fears and responses to the coronavirus pandemic. The market also has also triggered ""circuit breakers"" that temporarily halt trading to prevent massive swings. 

What could potentially happen if they just halted all trading for the next two months as a medium-term circuit breaker? Assume they did it at night without warning so that people couldn't get trades in before the closure. Would the rest of the economy continue to function otherwise (other coronavirus effects not withstanding)? During the closure, I would imagine that stock prices would just stay the same and then companies would adapt to their changing supply and demand situation as needed, right? 

Once it opened again there might be a swing once we know which companies have survived the pandemic and which won't but that speculation is happening on a daily basis now, why not just close it to prevent chaos and allow companies to think longer term without worrying about momentary market valuation?
","this idea of an extended  market holiday  is a completely normal idea. a lot of people have had this idea, especially today, and i will tell you below why it is terrible. just flat-out bad. i once had this idea during the gfc when i was also new-ish to the market, so do not feel bad.   i believe one of the cnbc hosts was touting this idea this morning. a simple way to refute one of the underlying notions here is thus: if you do not like what you see then just go ahead and close your eyes, and the bad thing will go away right  of course not.  you might say  maybe the market just does not know what stocks are worth right now and that is why the market is down.  i would answer that no one ever really knows exactly what a business/stock is worth  some exceptions aside . generally, people who sell think it is worth less than the price and people who buy think it is worth more, so why do we need to shut the market    you might say  maybe not everyone feels comfortable trading or feels like they know what this specific business/stock is worth right now so that is why we should halt trading.  i would answer with why can not the people that do want to trade continue trading and if you do not know/ just are not  comfortable  then step aside, no one is forced to trade  unless maybe they used leverage/need the money .   the punchline on extended market holidays, reiterated: except in cases of traders or technology used to trade actually being unavailable/overtaxed for some reason, it is something we should avoid at all costs. there are lots of negatives, and i am not aware of any positives outside of the corner cases mentioned above.  a surprise trading halt as you mentioned of an extended variety is one of the worst things that can be done to a market. imagine...   surprise  that thing you owned that you thought was liquid and you could buy or sell on most days monday-friday, excepting holidays, actually is not  and if you need to raise money between now and the market re-opening, tough   when the market does re-open, going forward, everything in that market should be priced more cheaply in one respect, and that is to account for a new illiquidity premium that has been introduced to the market. all else equal, if you could own the same stock on two exchanges and one had random extended trading halts while the other did not, there should be a disparity in the pricing, albeit not massive, between the two. i would rather own the one that trades more frequently. illiquidity in an asset is not a good thing.  just because something is not trading and its price stays the same does not mean its value is not changing, it just means that it is harder to estimate no one can truly see it  that true value. it is quite possible that when the market reopened some of the companies would be worthless. see the bullet two down on the economy for more info here.  it is harder for everyone to deal in securities that have random extended halts because of those halts, which hurts liquidity even further going forward. less liquidity is bad. the rest of the economy would continue to function, but not as well as it would with the market open. so many transactions happen in the market on a daily basis and while some of these are retail or professional investors trading in the market, many of these trades are transactions where one company is hedging their exposure to another company. or, just using the market to see a gauge of the health of their counterparty to determine if they are going to engage in a business transaction and if so at what level with what other terms. imagine one company is buying components from another. each will look at the markets to judge the health of the other in their negotiations. without functioning markets, that process gets more difficult and it is exponentially more difficult at times of stress when companies are worried about the health of other companies. that is when it is most important for markets to be open. if markets are not, distrust reigns and activity/deals between companies grind to a halt. that harms the economy. closing the market does not allow companies to think longer term. closing the market causes everyone to speculate which companies are in credit trouble and will not be around. others seek to limit or avoid exposure to the firms that might be failing by cancelling orders and halting shipments. just the rumor that someone is in trouble will cause others to stop dealing with that firm and then it really is over for the company in question. if the market was open that did not have to happen. the  chaos  you describe is simply the process of price discovery in times of uncertain economic outlook. the market is volatile, it is what it is. instead of wondering what companies are likely worth for the next two months we can let them trade and have a best estimate. that is what the market is, an estimating machine for the value of businesses.  those values are very important to businesses as they do business with each other. the stock market is not some pure speculation machine/ random number generator that pushes values around willy-nilly.  think of it this way: maybe i do not like when prices change so we should just have stocks trade once a year, then everyone can really  plan long term   that sounds ludicrous right  it is the same idea. the world is a scarier place, companies are making less, businesses are hurting, people are dying and stocks are worth less as a result. closing our eyes will not make the situation any better. restricting trade by closing the market would hurt the underlying economy. trade is generally a pretty good thing.

","  covid-19 is the result of a zoonotic outbreak from bats to an intermediate   and unidentified host   thence to humans. it is thought that bats do not suffer the disease themselves as they carry low levels of virus but the intermediate host modifies the virus, and amplifies it so that it vastly increases the amount of virus that can shed into the environment infecting humans. one possible scenario is that bat coronavirus combined with a fish coronavirus inside the intermediate host. this is based on the observation that the sars-cov-2 spike gene shares a 39-base insertion with a type of soldierfish that swims in the south china sea.  the sars-cov-2 infects humans via the ace2 surface receptor, but this receptor is not only found in humans. other animals have similar but not exactly the same ace2 receptors and several dogs and one cat have returned positive swabs for sars-cov-2. the cat developed covid-19 symptoms. the first dog died two days after being released back to its owner but that might have been from the stress of quarantine in a 17 year old pomeranian. ferrets also have an ace2 receptor which also binds strongly to the sars virus so presumably are also at risk. mice appear to be less at risk.    this is the first human-to-cat transmission of the novel coronavirus  sars-cov-2 . about a week after its owner got sick with covid-19, after returning from a trip to northern italy, the cat developed coronavirus symptoms: diarrhea, vomiting and respiratory issues, steven van gucht, virologist and federal spokesperson for the coronavirus epidemic in belgium, told live science.    the owner sent samples of vomit and feces to dr. daniel desmecht is lab at the faculty of veterinary medicine of liege. genetic tests showed high levels of sars-cov-2 in those samples, he said.  the cat recovered after 9 days,  van gucht said.   the hong kong govt is now asking that pets of infected patients must now be quarantined for 14 days.  the cdc gives the following advice  which is out of date based on the above :    if you are sick with covid-19  either suspected or confirmed , you should restrict contact with pets and other animals, just like you would around other people. although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with covid-19, it is still recommended that people sick with covid-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. this can help ensure both you and your animals stay healthy.    when possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. avoid contact with your pet including, petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. if you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with them. for more information visit: what to do if you are sick.   we do not have information on cows but presume that they may also be susceptible.  edit: experimental data suggests cats are more susceptible to the virus than dogs    the team, led by virologist bu zhigao, infected five domestic cats with sars-cov-2 through the nose. when two of the cats were euthanized six days later, the researchers found viral rna, as well as infectious virus particles, in their upper respiratory tracts.    the other three infected cats were put in cages next to three uninfected felines. the team later detected viral rna in one of the non-infected cats, which suggests that they contracted the virus from the infected cats through respiratory droplets. all four cats also produced antibodies against sars-cov-2. surveillance for sars-cov-2 in cats should be considered as part of efforts to eliminate covid-19 in humans, the authors note in the preprint, which has not been peer reviewed.   and    dogs, however, were less susceptible to the virus. the researchers infected five young dogs and found that two excreted viral rna in faeces, but none contained infectious virus.    similar investigations in pigs, chickens and ducks identified no viral rna in animals deliberately infected with the virus, or those exposed to the infected animals   http://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-says-pets-of-coronavirus-patients-need-to-be-quarantined-11582888486  http://www.livescience.com/cat-infected-covid-19-from-owner.html  http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html  http://blogs.plos.org/dnascience/2020/02/20/covid-19-vaccine-will-close-in-on-the-spikes/  http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007 2f978-0-387-33012-9 93.pdf  http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00984-8 ",94

Can I get coronavirus from a package sent from China?,"no.  the new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through goods manufactured in china or any country reporting covid-19 cases,  the world health organization says.    even though the new coronavirus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days  depending on the type of surface , it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperatures,  who said.   again, the best ways to prevent transmission is to stay 6 feet away from others, thoroughly wash your hands, and disinfect surfaces with epa-approved products.",47

"There are numerous articles talking about how people are tired of staying in lockdown:


  As Greece enters its third week since restrictive measures were first
  imposed to combat the spread of coronavirus, there is mounting concern
  that fatigue is setting in amid signs of people beginning to flout the
  policies.
  
  Speaking to ANT1 TV, the government spokesman Stelios Petsas said the
  centre-right administration was now considering placing a time limit
  on the movement of citizens outdoors, the Guardian reports.


Are there any polls which attempt to track how much people are content with staying under lockdown?
","the day after lockdown measures were implemented in the uk, yougov conducted a poll of 2788 adults testing whether they supported or opposed the imposition of the measures.  they found that 76  of respondents strongly supported the measures, 17  somewhat supported them, and only a combined 4  opposed them in any way.  just over two weeks later, on april 9th, they conducted another poll which asked respondents whether they would support or oppose lockdown restrictions being extended further than the initial three week period.  it found that while strength of support may have dropped slightly, the public was still overwhelmingly in favour of an extended lockdown, and that any drop in support was fairly negligible - combined opposition was found to be 5 , with combined support at 91 .  indeed, yougov has also found that at least in one part of the uk, respondents think that the lockdown does not go far enough - a poll published on april 10th that surveyed adults in wales found that a majority  53   thought that the lockdown measures should be tightened, with only 6  thinking that the measures should be relaxed.  i think we can conclude from this that although there may be a small amount of quarantine fatigue given the slight drop in strength of support for the lockdown measures between march 24th and april 9th, the public still remains overwhelmingly content with the measures at the moment, and there is evidence that at least one constituent country of the uk may support a tightening of the lockdown measures.

Can the coronavirus live on my clothes?,"yes, but a different question is what you should do about it. a virus tends to live longer on some nonporous surfaces, like steel or plastic, as compared to fabrics like cotton or leather. but after numerous people who attended a buddhist temple in hong kong fell ill, health workers did find coronavirus on the cloth covers of prayer books, among other items. it is probably not worth looking up stats and studies about every kind of surface in your life. the takeaway is the same: disinfect surfaces that are touched a lot and  wash your hands  http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/how-to-wash-your-hands- coronavirus.html  after touching anything, and especially before touching your face or eating.  two broadway composers even wrote you  a song to sing while you wash  http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/well/we-wrote-you-a-hand-washing- song-listen-up.html  .",74
"How long does the virus live on different surfaces? A friend gets my paper and shopping, and I have meals delivered - how do I unpack?","covid-19 is primarily spread in tiny droplets released from the nose and mouth of an infected person as they cough. the most common way for the virus to be transmitted appears to be through close contact with an infected person.  however, evidence suggests the virus can live for an extended time outside of the body, including on surfaces. if you touch a contaminated surface and then your nose or mouth, there is a possibility you could become infected.  a study published last month suggests the virus survives longest on plastic and stainless steel surfaces - up to two to three days - and can live for up to 24 hours on cardboard. however, over that time the virus is likely to become less powerful.  where possible, it is a good idea to either disinfect the packaging with kitchen spray or discard it before washing your hands with soap and water.    for items like a newspaper that can not be washed, the likelihood of transmission is low, but it still makes sense to practise regular hand washing.    bearing in mind the virus is durability, it is also worth regularly disinfecting plastic and stainless steel surfaces such as door handles.",55

"A friend of mine is currently in Cuba and was due to return to the UK on 2 April travelling Holguin> Montreal with Air Canada, and onwards to London Gatwick with BA (single PNR, booking made direct via the Air Canada website).

Yesterday she received an email cancelling her flight but without giving any alternative. Long-distance communication from Cuba can be difficult, so far she has been unable to contact the airline to find out if they will re-book her on an earlier flight.

I have tried to help her from the UK, but the ‘manage my booking’ option just directs me to a toll free number that doesn’t connect. I tried calling their Customer Services number in Canada but, unsurprisingly I suppose, could not get through.

FWIW, she is a UK citizen married to a Cuban citizen/resident but will need to try to extend her 60 day visitor visa (usually the maximum allowed) if she is trapped in Cuba. She is a 15 hour bus journey away from Havana and if possible needs to depart from Holguin. Only a few airlines fly into Holguin, the only realistic alternative would be Condor via Frankfurt, then Lufthansa to UK.

To date I don’t recall seeing many questions about Air Canada and flight cancellations. I am aware that they are offering a flexible change policy right now. 

My question is: 


has anyone else been in this situation with Air Canada since the COVID-19 emergency erupted?

"I did asked before , but apparently providing a link to a science report of harmless for humans (both skin and eyes) far-UV light was not enough to make people understand the significance of the solution to the raging COVID-19.
So this link (please read a bit of it):
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w
Says that the UV light of wavelength 222 nanometers (the photons bounces off the skin and the eyes) is absolutely harmless and do not make neither skin cancer or cataract. So this light is deadly for viruses and is not commercially available to anyone like ordinary humans (perhaps only some labs got it but sure cannot by on amazon or ebay or so). So if you wish to protect people you ideally need something to kill the virus in mid-air exactly as this lamp does.
Cite: ""By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207–222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin."" - this line is at the beginning of the link above.
So my idea is to help ordinary people that have some DIY experience to make a lamp and disinfect the clothes and themself like skin and face and face mask and so.
So a guy good in chemistry of similar that ca help with his knowledge and experience to help the people and get rid of the virus.
The research I did in the internet says that the UV has ability to kill virus in 10 seconds.
So having a lamp emitting harmless 222nm UV light instead the cancer deadly 254nm UV germicidal lamps will be able to protect from the diseases.
The question is how to make it.

so I suppose you can type a good way to do it and save the half of the western world population (the old people like your grandma and grandpa)?

(Nobody needs glass (or quartz) blowing of a lamp. Neither skills beyond the ordinary DIY - well it might be a need of experienced DIY-er.)
","uvc is very harmful to people and requires specialist equipment to create and use safely  you are not going to be able to create or use lamps that emit 222nm light without specialist equipment, and even if you could it would almost certainly not be safe.  far uv lamps are widely commercially available for germicidal applications and these usually use mercury vapour fluorescent discharge tubes with no phosphors so have a strong emission around 250nm from a line in the mercury emission spectrum. they are very dangerous to people and have caused significant harm when used accidentally  see this video from bigclive describing what happens when they are used accidentally instead of the much less harmful  black light  tubes commonly used for discos and events .   another important fact to bear in mind is that uvc lamps of this type have to use specialist glass in manufacture because common types of glass strongly absorb uvc wavelengths. so, while they are readily available, they are not easy for an amateur to make.  you report a claim from a nature paper than a tightly controlled uvc light of around 222nm wavelength is not harmful to people. i would be far more cautious as the nature paper did not do extensive safety studies on the actual effect on people and given what we know about wavelengths not much longer, the claim would need some extensive validation.  but you have bigger problems than this in your pursuit of an easy-to-make solution accessible to amateurs. first, you cannot easily get around the problem of the glass used absorbing the wavelengths you want to see: you will need specialist material. second, the actual excimer lamps as used in the nature paper are sophisticated devices that cannot easily be made by non-specialists  they are far more complex than the relatively conventional discharge tubes used in commercial uv lamps which are essentially the same as conventional visible fluorescent lamps apart from the need for specialist glass . apart from anything else the lamps have a strong emission at around 258nm, exactly the wavelength known to be very dangerous to people from simple uvc mercury vapour lamps. the nature paper reported using specialist narrow band filters to eliminate those wavelengths. these are unlikely to be easy to obtain. third, creating the excimer lamps is a sophisticated process requiring specialist pulsed electronic drivers to get the lamp to work  most likely, according to this reference in the nature paper, you need to fine tune the gas mixture and the pressure and the driving electronics for the lamp which is far more complex than a simple driver for a fluorescent tube .  and, as for  nobody needs glass  or quartz  blowing of a lamp , i am afraid you are delusional. you need specialist glass to let the right wavelengths through and specialist filters to kill the harmful wavelengths. this is not  simple diy .  you have seen an interesting paper in nature and assumed it is easy for someone to make in their shed. this is not true. specialist skills are required and attempting anything without those skills is likely highly dangerous  and that is ignoring the issues of handling the chemicals and vacuum technology needed to create the lamp: both are dangerous .   and, perhaps more importantly, the best way to avoid contamination of others with covid-19 is to wash your hands. there are no easy technological silver bullets here, though, perhaps, professional engineers and chemists can build something safe based on the nature observation in the future.

"Romania has virtually the worst public health system in EU and there is no surprise that it is far from being prepared for tackling the coronavirus infection.

On major issue is that corruption (e.g. among hospital managers) has led to hospitals to not have the minimum equipment (masks, gloves) not even for a week or two. 

In this context lots of medical workers got infected and quite a lot decided to quit. The government wants to tackle this issue by either withdrawing their right to practice medicine or expanding their notice period.

Since Romania already has a significant medical staff deficit, the second option is more likely. Currently the law mentions a 20 working days period notice (~ 1 month), but the government is considering 60 working days (~ 3 months). Based on some epidemic spreading simulations this will cover the worst period of the epidemics. This means de facto forcing the medical staff to face the infection without proper equipment.

Working without proper equipment means a much higher chance of getting infected, infecting colleagues and patients.

There was a lot of debate over this issue and I am wondering if such measures are compatible with EU laws or the emergency sate can simply override some EU laws that have priority over national laws. 

Question: Can an EU country government force its medical doctors work with SARS-CoV2 infected patients without the proper equipment?

Note: Some equipment was indeed received very recently, a few weeks after the first coronavirus case was officially confirmed in Romania.
","the eu directives and regulations with respect to  workplaces, equipment, signs and personal protective equipment  can be found here. the directive that i think is most relevant is directive 89/656/eec - use of personal protective equipment.  this directive sets minimum standards for ppe used by workers, and states the obligations that employers have on this matter:    personal protective equipment must be used when the risks cannot be  avoided or sufficiently limited by technical means of collective  protection or procedures of work organization.    all personal protective equipment must:      be appropriate for the risks involved, without itself leading to any increased risk  correspond to existing conditions at the workplace  take account of ergonomic requirements and the worker is state of health  fit the wearer correctly after any necessary adjustment.      the employer must provide the appropriate equipment free of charge and  must ensure that it is in good working order and hygienic condition.   when defining what this directive covers, the following exceptions are noted:    the definition in paragraph 1 excludes:     a  ordinary working clothes and uniforms not specifically designed to  protect the safety and health of the worker      b  equipment used by emergency and rescue services      c  personal protective equipment worn or used by the military, the  police and other public order agencies      d  personal protective equipment for means of road transport      e  sports equipment      f  self-defence or deterrent equipment      g  portable devices for detecting and signalling risks and nuisances.   none of these exceptions would seem to cover medical workers except the rather non-specific  emergency and rescue services . i would take that to mean paramedics, ambulance staff, and mountain rescue workers and the like, however it is possible that this clause could be used to exempt general medical workers from this protection.  specifically in the case of romania, this directive has been implemented in national law by  hotarare privind cerintele minime de securitate si sanatate pentru utilizarea de catre lucratori a echipamentelor individuale de protectie la locul de munca , or  decision concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the use by workers of personal protective equipment at the workplace . from my rudimentary translation of the law, this appears to be pretty much word for word a translation of the original directive.  at first glance then, it seems that failing to provide adequate ppe for hospital staff is a breach of the employer is obligations under this eu directive. however, there are a number of exceptions noted in the directive, not to mention exceptions in national law, which could be used to exclude hospital workers from the protection. in addition, a few national governments have not implemented the directive into national law yet. this makes it difficult to give a definitive answer before this is tested in the courts, as a spanish doctor is union is attempting.

"It is widely considered that the passing of the corona virus bill in Hungary is a huge step towards dictatorship. (See, for example, here: https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-viktor-orban-rule-by-decree/)

The main argument is that:


The bill allows prime minister Orban to rule by decree infinitely (at least as long as he sees fit) and that
There is no real need for these measures even during the current COVID-19 pandemic.


But what remains is the question whether there is any need for such measures. From my view as a outsider, I can't really see any benefits concerning the fight against the pandemic. Fidesz already has a two-third majority in parliament, enabling it to rule mostly unhindered and is even  able to change the constitution if deemed necessary. Any (tough) measures could probably be passed easily by Fidesz without Orbán having to be able to rule by decree.

Of course, if someone would like to transform the country into a dictatorship, these measures would make a lot of sense. But are there other reasons that may justify the necessity of the bill?
","well, one obvious justification is that it means the parliament does not have to assemble.    it is difficult to organize a parliamentary debate while keeping social distancing. what if some legislators get into contact with an infected person. could they still speak and cast their vote, or would they be banned during the quarantine period    of course the parliament could e.g. have put a narrow expiry date on the rules, but who knows how feasible a session would be three or six months from now  an expiry of  after the pandemic  would be too fuzzy.     my personal opinion is that the parliament should have found a way to stay relevant, but the question asked for possible justifications.  an option might have been to change parliamentary rules to reduce the quorum, possibly combined with pairing, or to allow online debates and voting, but those are difficult for democracy as well.

How to protect yourself from Covid-19,"as covid-19 is spread through droplets, it can reach us through the air. therefore, maintain social distancing, which means remaining 6 feet away from others. ideally, you should not touch any surface on which droplets may have landed. the best way to protect yourself from exposed surfaces is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water for a count of 20. the children is book coronavirus you can not scare me teaches kids through pictures and rhyme:    i wash my hands throughout the day/ and count from one to twenty/ the palms, the backs, the fingernails/ with soap and water plenty.    coronavirus you can not scare me written by the author  the best way to ensure you are doing all the above is to stay home if you can. talk to your friends and family on the phone, social media, skype or zoom.",82
"A big problem with the current COVID-19 epidemic is the difficulty of getting tested (due to mild symptoms and lack of testing kits). This makes it impossible for patients with little or no symptoms to know how likely it is to be infected and further spreading the disease. 

There are estimations available but only take into account confirmed cases (and range between 10x-1000x of this number). How could one get estimations of the number of patients by using secondary features of the distribution that could be more robust? Age-adjusted death rate under intensive care could be one of several such parameters.


","death rate  using death rate may work when people that die have most likely acquired the virus locally.   however, for the moment, many people die because they acquired the virus during a visit to another area, or because they got it from another person that acquired the virus abroad.   thus this death-rate based number is not very accurate unless the virus has fully spread out  in which case it will be more likely to get infected from a local source .   for the cases of wuhan, italy and other epi-centers, which have more spread due to local infections rather than foreign infections, death rate might be a good probe  although you still have to deal with the delay .  in addition, while death rate might be more thrustworthy than total cases of infection  just think about the germans, with lots of supplies, are testing with a lot of thousands people, while neighboring countries, with limited supplies, are trying to limit the use of testing as much as possible , bit it is still a biased number. it is not easy to determine/pinpoint the cause of death. often multitude of diseases are present. if a person with cancer or aids gets a pneumonia from ncov-19, then what is the cause  the sampling of  cause of death  is not very clear and becomes part of the analysis.  statistics are only usefull for a comparison when they have a similar underlying basis.   travel data  the virus is mostly spreading out irregularly over a network. it spreads out differently at different scales, within the household, neighborhood, workplaces/schools, villages, agglomerations, countries, continents. you can sort of see the virus spread around with sudden jumps from large node/community to large node/community.   you can use occurrence of the virus in those nodes/communities as the variable  so you do not count individuals, since we do not know the presence in all individuals, but instead count the much better known presence of the virus in communities , and then use a model for the dynamics of the virus spreading between this different nodes in the network.  for instance. e.g. in region a you encounter x cases of disease among people that came from region b and y cases of disease among people that came from region c, while the travel to those regions is  r  and  q , then an estimate of the relative presence of the virus in regions b:c can be approximated by  x/r : y/q .  i remember there was an early article on the spread of covid-19  i believe it was by chinese scholars  that tried to estimate  r 0  and included information about the frequency of travel between different regions.    random tests  you can perform test on a sample from the population that does not show any symptoms and use the prevalence of the virus among this sample to make an estimate about the prevalence in the entire population.  if the prevalence is very small then this requires a very large sample which might be difficult. in that case one may perform the test among a sample where the suspicion of the prevalence is higher and gain some information about how many people have the virus in that group. such a measure can be used to calibrate the estimates based on incomplete information  ie. along with other information, such as the rate at which people with the virus have the particular mild or severe symptoms, you get an idea about how much the current estimates are underestimating the true number of cases .

"If someone happens to catch COVID-19 when we're on the other side of the curves -- when deaths and new infections are slowing -- would their symptoms somehow be less severe?  

A milder fever?  A weaker cough?  

Sorry for the naivety in the question.
","there are about 8 common strains of the sars-cov-2 virus in circulation. it appears to be mutating slowly based on phylogenetic analyses and each mutation appears to be the same in terms of clinical disease and lethality.  so, there is no expectation that if you catch the disease late in its spread that the clinical disease is going to be any different from any other time that it is caught.    now, more diversity is emerging. like all viruses, sars-cov-2 evolves over time through random mutations, only some of which are caught and corrected by the virus is error correction machinery. over the length of its 30,000-base-pair genome, sars-cov-2 accumulates an average of about one to two mutations per month, rambaut says.  it is about two to four times slower than the flu,  he says. using these little changes, researchers can draw up phylogenetic trees, much like family trees. they can also make connections between different cases of covid-19 and gauge whether there might be undetected spread of the virus.   http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/mutations-can-reveal-how-coronavirus-moves-they-re-easy-overinterpret ",66

","they may do so at some point if the risk is deemed high enough  remember that who still does not consider this as a severe enough pandemic at the international level .  however:   why would they ban flights from all over china, when a majority of the cases are concentrated in a much, much smaller area  remember that china is quite large. it would be akin to banning travel from all of europe after an outbreak in a single city. at the opposite end of the spectrum, if you consider that the virus has reached many places outside of china, why only ban flights from china rather than any country where there may have been any cases  unless all countries coordinate to completely isolate china  or whatever area is considered  infected  , then people will just travel via a third country, so the ban will be ineffective.   the difficult task of the health authorities is to balance reducing the risk that the virus spreads all over while not infringing on the freedoms to travel. they are constantly re-evaluating the risks based on the available info regarding number of cases, incubation period, ease of transmission, mortality rate, etc. it may be the case that this virus, even though new, is just no worse than the flu.  remember that a travel ban not only could be a problem in terms of freedoms and rights of the affected people  try telling us citizens they can not return home - the us government would be taken to court before you finished reading this sentence , but it also has a strong impact on the economy, which itself may have severe health repercussions.  there are probably millions of people who catch the flu, and thousand who die from it every year in your country  i know that is the case in mine . do you think all travel in or out  or even within  yours should be stopped during the winter because of this  ",125
"(First time posting on this SE, I hope it's not off-topic.)

I have a friend who lives in the Netherlands, let's call her Allison. Both her and her neighbor (let's call him Bob) live in an apartment complex owned by a therapy organization they are both patients at, and their landlord is also the owner of said organization. Bob has lived there longer than Allison.

Every once in a while (at least once a week, though sometimes a lot more often), Bob tends to be very noisy in his apartment, by listening to loud music or playing with a pinball machine (a physical, real life one, not a video game). This often also happens very late at night, which is obviously not allowed per contract, and the walls are incredibly thin. Allison has complained about this numerous times, as it prevents her from sleeping at night and her mental health is suffering because of it, which the therapy home was supposed to be helping with. The inhabitants of the other apartments don't hear any noise, as Allison's apartment is the only one that share's a wall with Bob's.

The problem: Since Bob is a therapy patient himself, the landlord and the therapists appear to be protective of him. Supposedly, he has his own baggage that prevents him from noticing, caring or remembering that he's being inconsiderate. While they don't explicitly condone him doing this at night, they barely take any direct action. Instead, they advised Allison to use earplugs, since the person who lived in her apartment before her never complained about this and they figured she may just be too sensitive. When the earplugs didn't help, they told her to message Bob whenever he's being too loud, because he apparently needs constant reminding that he's not supposed to do this after a certain time of day. Allison tried this, and it helped, but the silence usually only persists for a few minutes before being broken again.

On Allison's request, the landlord eventually agreed to order noise cancelling panels to be installed on the wall between their apartments. However, he only agreed to pay for the very cheapest ones available, which had to be shipped from China and are now being withheld due to the Corona virus. Furthermore, after it was clarified that these panels would need to be installed on Bob's side of the wall in order to have any effect, Bob suddenly expressed that he's not willing to put in the effort to do so. In other words, he refuses to actively do something to fix the problem he's causing, despite the panels being gifted to him (Allison has expressed willingness to invest into panels for her side of the wall out of her own pocket, just for added sound isolation, but as stated earlier, those won't do much on their own).

Recently, Allison's therapist started encouraging her to look for other apartments, all of which turned out to be substantially more expensive than her current one (given similar size and quality). Despite knowing that Allison's financial situation isn't the best, her therapist kept suggesting that it might be worth it to get some peaceful nights. Allison feels like this is rather unfair, like she's being punished for her neighbor breaking the contract and keeping her up at night, and that the landlord / therapy organization should put more effort into solving this for her, as the contract states that excessive noise at night is grounds for eviction. However, whenever she brings these arguments up, they keep getting dodged.

Allison tried contacting the police about this, but they dismissed her case as something that's out of their reach. They advised her to try something called a ""neighborhood mediation"", though Allison has strong doubts about the usefulness of such a thing, as the landlord and therapists have already tried mediating between the two of them.

Question: Is there any other way to resolve this issue? Can a therapy organization get away with catering to one patient's needs, despite that being extremely counterproductive to the needs of another patient, especially if the former is the one breaking the rules? Is it legal for the landlord to blatantly ignore a contract that was signed by all the involved parties and not take any action against one of these parties breaking it and strongly inconveniencing another one? And if not, how does one get him to take action?
","  can a therapy organization get away with catering to one patient is needs, despite that being extremely counterproductive to the needs of another patient, especially if the former is the one breaking the rules  is it legal for the landlord to blatantly ignore a contract that was signed by all the involved parties and not take any action against one of these parties breaking it and strongly inconveniencing another one    first, it is important for allison to distinguish between the existing legal relations and each one is separate ramifications.  the therapist looks manipulative and dishonest when encouraging allison to rent a more expensive place, since at this point it seems that the therapist knew or should have known that the situation involves the landlord  who coincidentally is the therapist is employer . at the very least, the therapist should have informed allison that the therapist has a potential conflict of interest, and thus let allison decide whether or not to rely on that organization is services. here, the therapist failed to make due disclosure.  instead, the therapist is acts have all the appearance of accommodating its other customer  bob , and ultimately trying not to disrupt its employer is profits both as landlord and as therapy business owner. that conflict of interest sounds in therapist is malpractice and may even amount to  therapist is  amp  company is  fraud.  regardless of whether allison chooses to denounce the therapist and/or the business, she should ask herself whether a therapy organization with such practices is apt for continued treatment of --and the ensuing profits from-- allison is therapy needs. one aspect allison needs to consider is that her continued business there would weaken her arguments if she eventually brings court proceedings against the therapist or his employer.  allison is tenancy is a separate issue. allison knows better than i  and the public in general  the terms of her lease and the physical details of her residential unit, so only she can compare them with section 7.4.2 of the burgerlijke wetboek to assess whether the lack of quiet enjoyment is attributable to a defect of the leased property  article 7:204.2 . allison should assess this issue from the standpoint of landlord is possible allegation that   the disturbance is caused by a third person   whereby the landlord would seek to avoid liability under 7:204.3 . depending on allison is determination of the aforementioned issue, she would have a claim against the landlord for breach of contract, and/or against bob for tortious conduct  6:162 .  there are at least three reasons why allison should follow the police is suggestion of neighborhood mediation. the first reason is that there has been essentially no mediation in allison is dispute. mediation requires a nonparty whose neutrality is not compromised when conducting the mediation. that has been missing here so far. allison has only dealt with third parties  i.e., the landlord and therapists  who are first and foremost reluctant to inconvenience their noisy client bob for fear of affecting their own business interests. allison is belief that these people were conducting a form of mediation is mistaken.  the second reason is that, from mediation, allison may pursue and obtain a written  amp  signed agreement whereby bob promises to desist from his pattern of disturbances  ideally allison would secure an akin sort of commitment also from the landlord . in the event that allison subsequently needs to sue either or both of the parties for the continued disturbances, filing in court these binding documents  which she would have obtained through mediation  will ease allison is burden of proof.  the third reason is that genuine mediation might obviate allison is need to seek remedies in court. that is because it would teach both landlord and bob that allison is able and willing to take legal action if the situation persists or escalates, which might have a dissuading effect on them. furthermore, mediation proceedings will give allison some experience as to presenting her legal arguments in a more formal setting.  courts in netherlands may grant injunctive relief in situations like allison is where the ongoing harm is not susceptible of being quantified in monetary terms. allison may pursue that relief, which if granted would compel the police to enforce it each time bob violates it.

"Coronavirus, HIV, 1918 Flu, etc. They all come from animals. Do any infectious diseases (in humans) come from plants? More specifically, are there viruses that infect plants that can mutate to infect humans?
","question     are there viruses that infect plants that can mutate to infect  humans     answer  none appear to have been reported so far. it is difficult to provide supporting evidence for an assertion that they do not exist, but a recent review on the relationship between plant and animal viromes does not include any examples, and our general understanding of the mechanisms by which viruses infect organisms and cells suggest that this is unlikely. there are, however, examples of plant viruses replicating in the insect vectors that transmit them.  evidence  in 2011 dolja and koonin of the nih published a review in current opinion in virology 1 322-331 entitled common origins and host-dependent diversity of plant and animal viromes. in this they considered:      ...three distinct scenarios for the origin of related viruses of plants  and animals: i  evolution from a common ancestral virus predating the  divergence of plants and animals  ii  horizontal transfer of viruses,  for example, through insect vectors  iii  parallel origin from related  genetic elements.    the very fact that there was a need to argue for a relationship indicates the assumed distinction between animal and plant viruses, and indeed they write:     ...plants are not known to support reproduction of dsdna viruses and  retroviruses.    the only reference in the whole article to an actual biological relationship between animal and plant viruses is the following:     strikingly, viruses of the order mononegavirales and the family  bunyaviridae... can also reproduce in their arthropod vectors.    the paper referenced in support of this statement is by hogenhout et al. and was published in the annual review of phytophathology  2008  46 327-359, and is entitled insect vector interactions with persistently transmitted viruses. from this it emerges that there is a class of plant viruses called persistent propogative viruses which replicate in the circulation of their insect vectors, in contrast to most types of circulative viruses. the insects involved include the leafhopper  illustrated below in fig 1 from that review  and the thrip.    schematic representation of persistent virus transmission by a leafhopper. viruses that are transmitted in a circulative persistent manner do not replicate in the insect and usually enter the salivary glands from the hemolymph. in plants, replication of circulative viruses is frequently restricted to the phloem tissues. in contrast, most propagative viruses replicate in several plant tissues and in different organs of the insect vectors   yellow arrows  and may enter the salivary glands either from the hemolymph or from other connecting tissues, e.g., the nervous system or trachea.   it is not clear to me whether the virus is in any way detremental to the insect vector -- certainly it is not the primary target of the virus, and replication can be regarded as allowing it to survive longer before the insect transmits it to the plant.  today insects, tomorrow people   the very fact that persistent propogative insect viruses can replicate in their animal vectors raises the question whether the insects could somehow transmit them to human beings. in an answer to a different question on whether insect pathogens can infect humans i have argued that the absence of examples in situations where people come into close contact with insects and the difference in anatomy and molecular structure of cell membranes makes this unlikely. in the present case we are not even talking about an insect pathogen, but a plant pathogen.

The president's remarks were then followed by Dr Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who reiterated the organisation's remarks of February 25th where the director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, said that:


  Ultimately, we expect we will see community spread in this country.


What measures, referred to by the President, have already been taken by the US government to prepare for the virus? Which of these have the Trump administration been responsible for? What is the purpose of the new team announced yesterday?
","rather poorly one could say, with respect to testing. there is now outrage that the cdc has pursued its own flawed test kit under some version of nih  which in this case stands for  not invented here  , rather than adopt the one used by the who  and which was developed in germany ...    on monday, following mounting criticism of the federal response, trump administration officials promised a rapid expansion of the country is testing capacities. with the help of private companies and academic centers, as many as a million diagnostic tests could be administered by the end of this week, said dr. stephen hahn, commissioner of the food and drug administration.    but many scientists wonder if the moves come too late.  ...  most disturbing of all: did a failure to provide adequate testing give the coronavirus time to gain a toehold in the united states      clearly, there have been problems with rolling out the test,  said dr. thomas frieden, former director of the c.d.c.  there are a lot of frustrated doctors and patients and health departments.     still, dr. frieden said he thought the situation was improving. other experts, although supportive of the agency, were mystified that federal officials could have committed so many missteps.     the incompetence has really exceeded what anyone would expect with the c.d.c.,  said dr. michael mina, an epidemiologist at harvard university.  this is not a difficult problem to solve in the world of viruses.     officials at the c.d.c. did not respond to repeated requests for comment. the agency abruptly canceled a news conference on monday just as it was to begin. officials appeared to have removed figures on the agency website counting how many americans had been tested.    in february, the c.d.c. rolled out a three-step diagnostic test and distributed testing kits -- each of which could run about 800 tests -- to state and local health laboratories. but some of the components of the diagnostic kits were flawed, and produced inconclusive results.    a three-step replacement was promised but never arrived  the agency has not fully explained why, except to say that there was a manufacturing defect. as a result, diagnostic testing was only conducted at the agency is labs in atlanta.    the c.d.c. eventually rolled out a two-step replacement and permitted a few laboratories, where the kits had been working, to continue using their tests. but those with only one working component of the test still could not diagnose patients on their own.    getting results from the c.d.c. took days, however, and in any event the criteria for testing were strict -- among them, the patient must have had recent travel to china or contact with someone known to be infected.    doctors nationwide complained of a bottleneck, both because of the restrictive test criteria and because of the agency is limited testing capacity. the agency said it had the capacity to test about 400 specimens a day.    the test criteria were  too stringent, and people are not getting tested,  said lauren m. sauer, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at johns hopkins medicine.     ...      we have been really frustrated, because one of the things that is a hallmark of public health labs is that we are usually aready, set, go,  and here we were -- aready, set, wait ,  said scott becker, chief executive of the association of public health laboratories.    late last week, the food and drug administration broke the logjam, authorizing state and local laboratories to do initial testing on their own. if labs had developed and validated a test, they could use it for diagnosis instead of relying on the c.d.c. is version or waiting for a replacement.    other nations have tested patients by tens of thousands. china has probably tested millions.     how come the south koreans can do 10,000 tests a day and we can not   said ralph baric, who studies coronaviruses and emerging diseases at university of north carolina.    soon after the virus surfaced in china, the c.d.c. got to work on its own test.  generally, c.d.c. provides these tests for the world,  said dr. frieden.    but german researchers were devising their own test, which was quickly adopted by the world health organization for distribution around the world.    after the c.d.c. is version turned out to be flawed, the agency continued to pursue it, despite the fact that another diagnostic test was already in wide use.    with f.d.a. approval, the agency could simply have distributed the test used by the w.h.o. instead of creating a new one from scratch, dr. mina said. the government could do so even now.     it is just a very american approach to say,  we are the u.s., the major u.s. public health lab, and we are going to not follow the leader,   dr. mina said.

"Reading numerous news articles about COVID-19, I got confused as to what is its main transmission route. In particular, I am confused as to whether it is


direct landing of respiratory droplets in mouths and noses, 
contaminated surfaces,
aerosols (i.e., suspensions of the virus in the air rather than respiratory droplets quickly landing in mouths or noses or on surfaces), or
something else.


On the one hand, the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that contaminated surfaces are not thought to be the main transmission route:


  It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. (Link)


The same website appears to suggest that the main transmission route is  direct landing of respiratory droplets in mouths and noses:


  The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
  
  
  Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
  Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
  
  
  These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.


On the other hand, the World Health Organization (WHO), like many other agencies, puts the main emphasis on washing hands. Here is the WHO's first and foremost piece of advice on how to prevent getting infected with the virus: 


  Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. (Link)


Social distancing is mentioned on that webpage only as a second piece of advice, and, furthermore, the webpage implies that it is safe to approach coughing people as close as 1 meter away:


  Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.


Furthermore, I found an article saying that the virus wasn't detected in the air of hospital rooms with COVID-19 patients, but was detected on surfaces: 


  When researchers in Singapore tested the air in the rooms of three Covid-19 patients, they found no virus particles on cleaned surfaces or in the air even when they took samples on days the patients were symptomatic and presumably shedding virus into the air, they reported this month in the Journal of the American Medical Association. In the room of the third patient, who shed more virus, virus particles were present on ventilation fans and numerous surfaces — but all air samples were negative. (Link)


But the same article also says that Chinese researchers found COVID-19 aerosols near patients' toilets.

My question: Actually what is the main way COVID-19 spreads?
","the confusion exists because there are conflicting pronouncements from various authoritative sources but also conflicting pronouncements from the same authority.  covid-19 is a respiratory infection spread by droplets that can be aerosolized  nuclear droplets  in certain situations such as by flushing toilets or in certain medical procedures such as intubation. however, it reaches the air it contaminates surfaces and this allows for the infection to be caught through the eyes nose and mouth with the virus being transferred from the hand.  the data from singapore and taiwan show that handwashing and social distancing are successful in preventing disease transmission. however, if social distancing is not rigorously enforced then you will need to wear a mask. the head of the chinese cdc, dr george gao, has recommended that everyone wear a mask which is advice that contradicts most countries health ministries. this is so that the infected are not shedding as many viral particles into the environment. his advice is based on the fact that there is a high degree of asymptomatic infection in the community and these people are spreading the virus by droplets just by talking and exhaling. the contrary advice is because they feel users are wearing masks to protect themselves, and, in the absence of training, they are almost certainly less effective at providing protection. but trained users have a similar degree of protection with both surgical masks and n95 masks.  so the main way of disease transmission is by respiratory droplet. but the fact that health workers, nypd officers  currently over 500  and others are getting infected wearing masks points to surface contamination as the second main mode of infection, or, possibly lack of training in wearing the masks and/or poor hand washing, or, that aerosol transmission is indeed important.  http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/not-wearing-masks-protect-against-coronavirus-big-mistake-top-chinese-scientist-says   http://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/19/opinion/guidance-against-wearing-masks-coronavirus-is-wrong-you-should-cover-your-face/ ",66
Is the presence of a fever always the first symptom of a coronavirus infection? Is there any value in taking your temperature every day?,"symptoms of covid-19 resemble the flu and include fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the cdc. some people also develop aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.  while fever is one of the most common symptoms, it is not productive to take your temperature every day, poland said.   that is like taking your blood pressure four times a day for no particular good reason. i would probably not do that unless there is a reason to do it. for example, if you felt feverish, or if you traveled to a high-risk area, or if you had contact with somebody  infected ,  he said.",115
The stores are all out of disinfectant sprays and hand sanitizer. Can I make my own?,"yes, you can make both at home.   unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted  if you are trying to kill coronavirus on a non-porous surface, the us centers for disease control and prevention said.   the cdc is recipe calls for diluting 5 tablespoons  or 1/3 cup  of bleach per gallon of water, or 4 teaspoons of bleach per quart of water.   you can also make your own hand sanitizer. the nebraska medical center - famous for its biocontainment unit and treatment of ebola patients - offers this recipe:  what you will need:    2/3 cup 91  isopropyl alcohol  rubbing alcohol   1/3 cup aloe vera gel  mixing bowl  spoon or something for whisking  small container, such as a 3 oz. travel bottle  optional: essential oil to give your hand sanitizer a fragrance    directions: in a mixing bowl, stir isopropyl alcohol and aloe vera gel together until well blended. add 8-10 drops of scented essential oil  optional, but nice . stir to incorporate. pour the homemade hand sanitizer into an empty container and seal. write  hand sanitizer  on a piece of masking tape and attach to the bottle.",107
"I have been using a Nikon D5200 with a Tamron 100-400 zoom for wildlife photography. It's admittedly a budget setup (in some sense of the term ""budget""), so I don't expect amazing results. I'm also not a trained photographer, and I've pretty much learned by reading the internet and youtube (not ideal, I know). Recently, I decided to rent a different Nikon body for an expedition (which ultimately got canceled due to COVID-19).

I decided to rent a mirrorless Nikon Z6 to see how I would like a mirrorless camera, and to try a full-frame sensor, and also just to get a newer sensor and body and see how the quality compares, using the same Tamron lens.

I made a lot of mistakes in using the new body, but ultimately I'm stumped still. The photos are displaying the same annoying glow that I've seen with the old body. I don't know what is causing it, but it seems like I can narrow it down to ""operator"" or lens errors.



In the image above, a heavily cropped section of a photo of a bird, you can see the glow. It shows up similarly using either body. This is shot at 400mm, ISO 320 f/6.3, 1/500 sec. 

I handhold the camera most of the time because I just can't use a tripod for most of these photos (the birds are up in a tree, jumping around, etc.)

Does anyone have any suggestions for what I should do here? Should I use faster shutter speed and higher ISO? I've tried that and found that I get a lot of noise, but maybe the newer sensors can handle it? I'd be willing to spend some $$ on a book or read any references people might recommend. 

Thanks!

EDIT
This image is uncorrected, straight out of the camera, though (sadly) I took it as a JPG originally. I usually shoot raw, but had my settings incorrect for this new body that I'm renting. I see the same effect whether it's RAW or JPG though, it was just that this photo showed the effect more strongly so that I could illustrate my question.
","you appear to be using your lens  100-400/5-6.3  with the aperture wide open. i would expect the glow in your photos to be significantly reduced or absent stopped down to about f8.  many lenses  glow  when used wide open, especially in bright light with high contrast. it is likely associated with spherical aberration and is typically reduced or completely gone when the aperture is closed a stop or two. increased familiarity with the lens  behavior and characteristics will allow you to predict when the glow will and will not be present. you will then be able to select apertures to match your artistic intent.

"Let there be a sample of 10,000 people.

5 of them die, 9 of them end up in intensive care.

What about the 9,900 asymptomatic people who did no get tested?

Scenario A: All 9,900 asymptomatic people would test negative for COVID19.
Scenario B: All 9,900 asymptomatic people would test positive for COVID19 because of a combination of high rate of asymptomatic carriers and high false positive rate.

Scenario A: true mortality rate is 5% and true intensive care rate is 9%.

","you are searching for the false-negative rate of these tests. a test resulting in a negative outcome while it should have been a positive outcome.   a recent article stated that most of the false-negatives of covid-19 tests are actually caused by not properly taking the samples from nose and throat. while i cannot find the original article i have got this information from, i have added two other relevant quotes. so yes false-negatives are possible but are likely caused by samples that are not properly collected.    the rollout of covid-19 testing is accelerating as more kits become available. however, a leading pathologist who was director of virology at stanford, points out that the results are not 100  accurate.  it is not that these tests can not detect virus,  said dr. bruce patterson.  my concern is that the sampling involved in detecting the virus can lead to clinical false negatives.  - http://abc7news.com/6053940/   also, the false-negative rate can vary based on the test method used and its quality and accuracy.    covid-19 tests are new, and assessing their accuracy is challenging. pcr tests may produce false negatives, failing to identify evidence of sars-cov-2. sometimes false negatives result from human error or problems with the procedure. giving the test too early or late, for example, can lead to a false negative. - http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-testing accuracy  ",66
"From KnowYourMeme: (spoilers)


  On the day before the airing of the final episode of School Days in Japan, a 16 year old girl killed her father with an axe in Kyoto. Due to an extremely similar scene present in the episode and to avoid relation to the axe murder, TV Kanagawa replaced it with a half hour of unrelated scenery with “Air on a G String” playing in the background. Among the shock and rage expressed among fans, a 4chan user commented “Nice Boat”, referring to the Norwegian ferry shown in the replacement footage. Immediately the phrase became a meme, however is far more popular in Japan than in English speaking countries.




The part with the boat is easily viewable on Youtube and other sites, but I haven't been able to find the full episode.

"(Not sure if this is the right SE for this question. I'm asking this here, because I'm looking for a biological answer, if one exists.)

This (potentially very naive) question is inspired by this news article: Bats for sale at Indonesia's wildlife market despite virus warning


  Bats, rats and snakes are still being sold at an Indonesian market known for its wildlife offerings, despite a government request to take them off the menu over fears of a link to the deadly coronavirus.


Why would the government request to take the meat of these animals off the market? Even if they're linked to the coronavirus, the virus presumably can be killed by cooking the meat prior to consumption. After all, protein denatures well before 100 degrees celsius, and once it denatures the organism should die. Conceivably the virus could affect the handlers of these animals prior to their being cooked, but not the consumers.

Some paragraphs later in the article illustrate my confusion:


  Restaurateur Lince Rengkuan -- who serves bats including their heads and wings stewed in coconut milk and spices -- says the secret is preparation.
  
  ""If you don't cook the bat well then of course it can be dangerous,"" she said.
  
  ""We cook it thoroughly and so far the number of customers hasn't gone down at all.""


Which is effectively what I've been thinking, but:


  ""We're also urging people not to consume meat from animals suspected to be carriers of a fatal disease,"" said Ruddy Lengkong, head of the area's government trade and industry agency.


How are these two seemingly-contradictory positions reconciled?
","restaurateur lince rengkuan is correct - once the bat meat is cooked the coronavirus will die, and the meat is safe to consume.  the indonesian government is not imposing restrictions for biological reasons, but for other reasons  these other reasons are out of scope of this se. ",131

"There are four drugs being tested for effectiveness against COVID-19 in the SOLIDARITY trial.  Three of them have obvious potential mechanisms of action:


Remdesivir is an RNA polymerase inhibitor.  It might stop the virus from multiplying once it infects a cell.
Hydroxychloroquine may interfere with the spike protein the virus uses to attach to cells.
Interferon beta has general antiviral effects.


But I can't find anything that would explain why the Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination is expected to do anything.  Both drugs appear to be protease inhibitors that are fairly specific to HIV, while SARS-CoV-2 isn't even in the same general group of viruses as HIV.
","the nejm editorial that accompanied that issue says:    one antiviral-drug candidate is a combination of the hiv protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir. lopinavir, which acts against the viral 3cl protease, has modest antiviral activity against sars-cov-2.   a quick search shows that sars-cov 3cl protease was the topic of some more in-depth investigations, including a theoretical thai study of how of lopinavir might act on the 3clpro of sars:    it was found that a mixture of two hiv-1 proteinase inhibitors, lopinavir and ritonavir, exhibited some signs of effectiveness against the sars virus. to understand the fine details of the molecular interactions between these proteinase inhibitors and the sars virus via complexation, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for the sars-cov 3clpro free enzyme  free sars  and its complexes with lopinavir  sars-lpv  and ritonavir  sars-rtv . the results show that flap closing was clearly observed when the inhibitors bind to the active site of sars-cov 3clpro.      from:  nukoolkarn et al.  molecular dynamic simulations analysis of ritronavir and lopinavir as sars-cov 3clpro inhibitors  j theor biol.    it is  above my pay grade  to comment whether that makes any sense or not as a practical approach to sars  or covid-19  medication, but the paper notes that lopinavir has a similar effect on the hiv protease:    similarly, this kind of flap  loop  closing was also observed when inhibitors bind in the active site of hiv-1 protease  hornak et al., 2006a, hornak et al., 2006b .   as noted on protopedia    drugs that inhibit hiv protease prevent the virus from replicating, and are crucial components of anti-hiv therapies.    the proteolytic active site of hiv protease is covered by two  flaps . it is believed that these flaps must open to enable substrate polyprotein to enter the active site. drugs that inhibit hiv protease tend to  lock  the flaps closed.   so i think they were/are hoping that 3cl plays a similarly vital role for sars and covid-19 virus replications, and so that drugs that close it will inhibit virus replication.  there seem to be other researchers who have considered this approach for the sars-covs, so perhaps it has some merit:    one promising approach is to develop small molecule inhibitors of the essential major polyprotein processing protease 3clpro. here we report a complete description of the tetrapeptide substrate specificity of 3clpro using fully degenerate peptide libraries consisting of all 160,000 possible naturally occurring tetrapeptides.    there is even a library-compound-search paper like that  i.e. trying to find molecules that would inhibit its 3cl  for sars-cov-2 out already  published march 26  by chinese and saudi researchers:    the viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease  3clpro  enzyme controls coronavirus replication and is essential for its life cycle. 3clpro is a proven drug discovery target in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  sars-cov  and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus  mers-cov . recent studies revealed that the genome sequence of sars-cov-2 is very similar to that of sars-cov. therefore, herein, we analysed the 3clpro sequence, constructed its 3d homology model, and screened it against a medicinal plant library containing 32,297 potential anti-viral phytochemicals/traditional chinese medicinal compounds. our analyses revealed that the top nine hits might serve as potential anti- sars-cov-2 lead molecules for further optimisation and drug development process to combat covid-19.   however, this latter paper also notes that there are some key differences between the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 3cl proteases, so compounds that work against one might not be so effective against the other:    results revealed that the sars-cov-2 3clpro receptor-binding pocket conformation resembles that of the sars-cov 3clpro binding pocket and raises the possibility that inhibitors intended for sars-cov 3clpro may also inhibit the activity of sars-cov-2 3clpro.    to test this hypothesis, we docked  r -n- 4- tert-butyl phenyl -n- 2- tert-butylamino -2-oxo-1- pyridin-3-yl ethyl furan-2-carboxamide , a potential noncovalent inhibitor of sars-cov 3clpro named ml188  35 , with the sars-cov-2 3clpro homology model. we also docked ml188 with the sars-cov 3clpro structure  pdb id: 3m3v  as a reference, and ml188 bound strongly to the receptor binding site of sars-cov 3clpro. the inhibitor targets the cys-his catalytic dyad  cys-145 and his-41  along with the other residues, and the docking score  s   -12.27  was relatively high. however, surprisingly, ml188 did not show significant binding to the catalytic dyad  cys-145 and his-41  of sars-cov-2, and the docking score  s   -8.31  was considerably lower  fig. s3 .    this paper also investigated  in the theoretical/computational sense  three other drugs of that kind that might work on the sars-cov-2 3cl: nelfinavir, prulifloxacin and colistin. nelfinavir is also a protease inhibitor used to treat hiv-1 and wikipedia says it is also being investigated for covid-19, but i have not checked the details. interestingly perhaps, lopinavir is not mentioned at all in this sars-cov-2 inhibitor screening study. i could not tell you exactly why, but it might be because there are at least six  1st gen  protease inhibitors used in hiv treatment  and some  2nd gen  ones  so they probably just picked one for this study as representative.

"TL;DR

What's the relationship between the following?


Mutation rates (expressed as ""mutations per year"" for a virus like e.g. COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). E.g. this article mentions ""The rate looks to be about 24 mutations per year""
Actual virion replication error rates in a single host cell, measured as e.g. error rates per released virion from the infected cell, i.e. (# of mutated released virions) per infected cell.




Assumptions

I would assume that mutations happen at a single virion-cell level because there are differences in e.g. nucleotides in RNA  between:


the virion infecting a cell (e.g. ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2)
the released virions from that same single cell


If so, wouldn't one argue that:


replication errors (at the nucleotide and thus released virion level) can easily happen, potentially billions of times during the infection of a single host organism
there is no ""single successful"" mutation or RNA variant within a host, rather, we have a distribution of RNAs, many of which could be simultaneously transmitted to another host organism?


Further context

I quote from e.g. this paper:


  On a per-site level, DNA viruses typically have mutation rates on the order of 10E-8 to 10E-6 substitutions per nucleotide site per cell infection (s/n/c). RNA viruses, however, have higher mutation rates that range between 10E−6 and 10E−4 s/n/c


Again, wouldn't that mean that a single host could 1) easily generate many mutations of the same virus and 2) pass most of those uniquely generated mutations to another host? If so, how come we can simply say ""24 mutations (over time) per year""? 
","since no one else has done so, just gonna expand on what occurred here in the comments  mostly from  alex reynolds :  tl dr: natural selection exists.  longer version:   mutations/replication errors/whatever will happen in the creation of new virus particles within a host cell. there is some distribution of number of mutational events that will occur as a function of the number of new rna molecules created per cell and the replication error rate. some subset of these rna molecules will be packaged into new particles, yielding a new generation of viruses that get a chance to infect. yes, this is potentially a large number of new mutations per infection event. some large proportion of these new particles will contain non-functional rnas, due to inactivating mutations of one kind or another. most of the new mutations will be worse at being a virus than the originally infecting virus  their immediate parent . so therefore, they will be outcompeted by non-mutated forms. among all those viruses which continue successfully infecting throughout the course of a year, on average we observe 24 substitution mutations in the genome over the course of that year. every transmission chain included in the group of viruses at the end of the year must have remained viable for infection of hosts. in other words, it has survived natural selection.   in population genetics, this phenomenon is known as  mutation-selection balance - e.g. new mutations arise in the population at a rate that is limited by the action of natural selection  at equilibrium .  genotype-phenotype maps  what of course i am leaving unstated is exactly why  ...new mutations will be worse at being a virus than the originally infecting virus...   this is very hard to predict in many cases. in some cases it is very obvious why a mutant is bad at being a virus, if e.g. an essential gene is deleted from the rna genome. but for many single mutations we do not really understand what their effect will be on virus function, we just observe that they drop out of the population due to negative selection.   if you are interested in this question, i recommend looking into genotype-phenotype maps. i know jesse bloom has done some work on influenza in this field, here is one example of such a paper. it is generally extremely laborious to do this kind of work, so relatively little is known about the functional effect of any specific mutation in any specific genome.  hope it is helpful to have all that written out.

The European Central Bank decided to buy €750 billion worth of bonds while the US is considering printing more dollars (my emphasis).


  The extraordinary actions of the Federal Reserve on Monday morning can be boiled down to two sentences: There is a rapidly developing shortage of dollars across the economy. And the Fed will do anything it needs to, on any scale imaginable, to end this shortage.
  
  Its announcement was phrased in the dry bureaucratese typical of statements from a central bank. But it contains a powerful idea. The Fed, the one entity in the world with the power to create dollars out of thin air, has every intention of doing so at whatever magnitude is necessary to try to reduce the severity and limit the duration of the coronavirus economic crisis.

From this basis, I'm a little bit confused about such difference in terms of fatality rate between the two analyzed countries. In fact, China has the maximum fatality rate at 4%, while Italy at more than 6%. For this reason I've two questions:

1) Is my computation correct?

2) If yes, why such a huge difference in terms of fatality rate? 



EDT II

I would like to improve this question reporting a recent Science paper which can partially explain these differences. In fact, Li et al reported that for each COVID+ patient, other 5-10 are undocumented COVID+ leading to missleading fatality rate. Moreover, as reported in the comments, to date, there are no univocal diagnostic methods wordwide.
However, Italy is experiencing a huge increment in daily cumulative deaths compered to China:

Something is happening there! Hubei province is almost similar to Italy in terms of surface and population but very different in terms of population mean age since Italy is one of the oldest EU country.
","reason 1 something technical about the computation.  dying occurs with some delay to getting sick. as a consequence the ratio of people that got sick and the people that have died, is not equal to the ratio of people that will die.   still, if the number of sick cases and death cases both grow exponentially with the same factor then you might still expect this number to remain constant, but keep in mind that the growth is not exponential and that it is only a simplified model     reason 2 something important about the data acquisition  you might say, ok then let is compare the number of death cases with the number of sick several days ago  according to the average number that it takes between getting sick and dying .  but, the most important reason why the death rate based on these statistics is not constant and not comparible is because those numbers are only the reported cases and those may be a lot less than the real cases. so you are not computing a real death rate.  the statistic  reported/confirmed cases  is not what you think that it is  number of cases . this is especially clear in the curve of cases for china which has a bump because the number of cases rapidly increased after the defenitions were changed  from positively tested people to people with clinical symptoms  ",66
"As part of my job, I helped my university to buy
an airline ticket for a student from city A to city B.
Due to the COVID-19 disease outbreak,
the student decided that it was too risky to travel,
and so he/she will remain in city A.

I noticed the following text in the electronic ticket:


  TICKET IS NON-REFUNDABLE
  
  NO SHOW PENALTY AT USD 250 PER TICKET


Questions:


Will my university or the student have to pay a no-show penalty
if he/she does not show up for the flight?
Should I take the effort to cancel the tickets with the airline?

Since the tickets are non-refundable,
I am assuming that my university will not get any money back for cancelling the tickets,
so there does not seem to be any benefit to us for cancelling the tickets.


(Note: city B is not yet a super high risk destination for COVID-19,
so I don't foresee the airline allowing a full refund for the airline tickets.)



I explain what I decided to do in the answer below.
","non-refundable does not mean what you seem to assume - it does not mean that the money is lost. it means that you do not get it back.  that might seem an irrelevant difference, but often it is not - you can use the value of the ticket for further bookings with the airline  for the same flier, not just anybody . if you cancel the ticket, you typically have 365 days  from day of payment, not day of flight  to use the value for another booking.  the no-show fee is a fee that gets taken out of your remaining value - if the flier simply does not show up  instead of cancelling , he will not get the full ticket value parked, but it will be reduced by the no-show fee. so you should definitely cancel, as it will save the no-show fee. only if the person is not going to fly within a full year is the ticket value completely lost.

How long does the virus live on an object like a dollar bill?,"depending on the type of surface, the virus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days, according to the who. a recent study by scientists in the u.s. found that viable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel.   however, a subsequent report from the cdc found that genetic material from the virus can live on surfaces for more than two weeks. the cdc found traces of the virus  rna, not the coronavirus itself, on surfaces in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers on the diamond princess cruise ship - 17 days after passengers had left the cabins.  it is possible that you can become infected if you touch your face after touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, according to the cdc. but scientists do not think surfaces are the main way that the virus spreads  the most common form of infection is from respiratory droplets spread by a person is cough or sneeze, the cdc reports.  meanwhile, the who says it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, traveled and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. that means the virus cannot spread through goods manufactured in china or any country reporting coronavirus cases.  at the same time, the who is reportedly encouraging people to use as many digital payment options as possible. viruses can survive on hard surfaces like coins for days in some cases. u.s dollars, a blend of fabric and paper, are harder for viruses to stick to.",110

"I am currently in a job in the US (on STEM OPT). I had a postdoc offer from a large US university that was supposed to start April 16. I signed an offer letter for a two year contract. We were in the process of deciding which visa to apply for (H1/J1). 

Today I got an email from the PI (HR copied) saying she would like to put the position on hold until things settle down. I asked for a clarification on what ""on hold"" meant and whether the offer letter was still valid. The HR replied this (PI copied):


  As for the offer letter you signed (due to redacted’s current
  situation) please consider it void until future notice.
  
  Professor [redacted] will contact you if you are still being considered
  for the position.


This is the last communication I had with the HR or the PI.

What does this mean? Since I have the signed offer, when things do settle down, is the university legally obligated to offer the position back to me before anyone else? Or the university is formally rescinding the offer and I should just move on? Can they do that? 

EDIT: Some answers have asked about my eligibility to work in the US. For clarification: I’m in the US now, in my current status, I can work in the US till the end of May. If the university applied for an H1B (which is typically approved for non profit), I could stay in the US as long as I didn’t leave the country (in which case I would have to get a visa stamped). Things could have gotten more complicated with J1, so we did not discuss much about that. 
","a signed offer letter is normally a valid contract. usually it is the only contract document. only someone who has read the offer letter can give you a perfect answer to this question.  they have announced their intention to break the contract. that is illegal unless the offer letter says otherwise. moving on is probably your best option.   there are two possibilities:   the university is unable to pay you, so they are forced to do something that could potentially cause them a lot of harm in the form of bad press or litigation. they did this voluntarily or out of incompetence, in which case the university is a bad place to work and you are lucky not to be working there.   in either case, you should look for employment elsewhere.

"Recently there are a lot of datapoints regarding COVID-19 related deaths. However I am looking to see how big the impact of non-diagnosed patients is.

Therefore I want to evaluate the deaths (corrected for reported virus deaths) and see how these compare to the same period in recent years.

I understand it is best practice to avoid asking for specific data sets here, so I will keep my question as generic as possible and ask for leniency:

Does anyone know how to find (or search for) recent mortality statistics? Ideally this would be ""per day per country up to today"", but even ""a total for February in a continent or city would already be insightful"".



What have I tried so far: 


Searching recent mortality, this only results in virus related statistics
Searching for several countries or WHO, this did not result in anything for this year

","it does not seem like the death toll is clearly showing up  yet .   for instance, europe has almost up to 10 000 deaths in a single day during the peak of a heavy respiratory season, and the covid-19 cases will only be a small bump, in relation to the overall burden of disease.  but, that would be playing down the impact of the virus. it is difficult to look at the overall death rate. many people are dying every day. we can not easily compare a single cause to the total amount of deaths that are occurring.  important to consider is that covid-19 deaths have a non-homogeneous spatial distribution and locally there is a high density that is not clear in common  public  databases that  mostly  present aggregate numbers. also, the outbreak is still young and is not yet fully processed in databases. so with better data we might be better able to see the impact of the disease  i suspect that the agencies have better information .  so the fact that we currently see little influence of covid-19 on aggregated statistics of death rate is not reassuring because it is meaningless to look at aggregated statistics  this depends a bit on your philosophy about nature and death though, personally i feel we are overreacting, but that is completely different from statistics .   see also this note from euromomo    note concerning covid-19 related mortality as part of the all-cause mortality figures reported by euromomo    over the past few days, the euromomo hub has received many questions about the weekly all-cause mortality data and the possible contribution of any covid-19 related mortality. some wonder why no increased mortality is observed in the reported mortality figures for the covid-19 affected countries.  the answer is that increased mortality that may occur primarily at subnational level or within smaller focal areas, and/or concentrated within smaller age groups, may not be detected at the overall national level. this even more so in the pooled european-wide analysis, given the large total population denominator. furthermore, there is always a few weeks of delay in death registration and reporting. hence, the euromomo mortality figures for the most recent weeks must be interpreted with some caution.  therefore, although increased mortality is currently not being observed in the euromomo figures, this does not mean that increased mortality does not occur in some areas or in some age groups, including mortality related to covid-19.

  eradicated all of the virus. A 100-fold dilution of bleach killed 100%
  of the virus half of the time, and decreased the number of live viral
  particles by greater than three logs in the other half of the tests.
  This was all after five minutes of treatment.
  
  So at least for viruses, you can probably dilute the bleach tenfold
  without worrying too much about decreased antimicrobial activity.


Personally, I don't find any logic why bleach would be more effective diluted, the opposite makes more sense to me. Is there any explanation for this to be so? Or it's just a wrong idea?
","the text does not say that more diluted bleach is more effective at killing viruses  or bacteria, or yeast, for that matter .   i am quoting:  ...a tenfold dilution of bleach, which subsequently mixed with an equal volume of rsv-containing medium  so in fact a twentyfold dilution  eradicated all of the virus. a 100-fold dilution of bleach killed 100  of the virus half of the time, and decreased the number of live viral particles by greater than three logs in the other half of the tests. this was all after five minutes of treatment...  so a 20-fold dilution kills all virus always  a 100-fold dilution kills 100  of the virus 50  of the time and kills most of them in the other cases.   i think form this we can conclude that more highly concentrated bleach is more deadly to viruses than more diluted bleach.

"There seems to be a bit of a conspiracy theory brewing over some data in the NCBI database, and I don't have the necessary knowledge to make sense of it.

It basically goes like this:


Go to NCBI BLAST
Click on the big Protein BLAST button
Enter AVP78033 in the main search box and click BLAST
Click on the first result that shows a 100% match and click ""See 5 more title(s)"" in the first entry


This shows that the search is a complete match for a Bat SARS-like coronavirus protein from a 2018 research paper, for Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus (which the NCIS site indicates is an alias for 2019-nCoV), and for Bat coronavirus from 29 Jan 2020.

My question is - why would a protein from Bat SARS-like coronavirus and 2019-nCoV be showing up as a perfect match for one another? Does this mean that 2019-nCoV might actually be a previously-discovered coronavirus that very recently started infecting humans? Or could it be that a recently collected sample from Wuhan was mis-identified as 2019-nCoV when it is actually the same coronavirus from the 2018 submission? 

Clicking around the links on that site seem to bring up dozens of similar but different pages that I don't have the knowledge to distinguish, but the Accession column from the search results described above contains a link to this page, which says that it is a provisional refseq and acknowledges that it is identical to the bat coronavirus:


  PROVISIONAL REFSEQ: This record has not yet been subject to final
              NCBI review. The reference sequence is identical to QHD43418.
              Annotation was added using homology to SARSr-CoV NC_004718.3.

","2019-ncov is a virus that originated from the bat  at least this is the current hypothesis . it shows 96  squence similarity to the batcov ratg13 sequence  see reference 1 , showing its origin.  it still is 87,99  identical to the  bat sars-like coronavirus , which explains the hit you found and is not unexpected, as these viruses are very closely related  see reference 2 .   these viruses are closely related, so i would not expect too many differences at all. then envelope proteins can be critical for function/structure of the virus, so mutations there might occur less frequent. and if they occur, i would only expect few changes over time, so with this little time gone, probably no mutation is seen yet. additionally, due to the redundancy caused by the codon degeneracy, not every mutation in the genomic material translates into changes in the protein.  references:   full-genome evolutionary analysis of the novel corona virus  2019-ncov  rejects the hypothesis of emergence as a result of a recent recombination event genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding  ",66

Won't Cal demand  his principal back at some time in the future? 
Similarly, won't countries' sovereign debts demand their principal? 
For example, China holds much US treasuries and US sovereign debt. If China thinks COVID-2019 will cripple the US and wants to park its money else where, won't China demand all of its principal from the US so that it can buy Australia or New Zealand sovereign debt instead? 



  'Country A owes \$10  to country B, and has agreed to pay 2% interest annually. Call this Debt X.
  
  Country B owes \$15  to country A, and has agreed to pay 1% interest annually. This is Debt Y.
  
  Investor A is willing to purchase Debt X for \$12, because he values the steady rate of return, and believes country A is very likely to pay its debts. He isn't as sure about Debt Y, but he is willing to pay \$16 for it. Investor B thinks that investor A is going to change his mind about Debt Y and value it more highly, so he is willing to pay \$17 for it today.
  
  Debt is traded constantly and it's valued differently. Just because 2 countries owe each other similar amounts of money, doesn't mean the value cancels out in any meaningful way.
  
  Think of debt this way. You and your three brothers all own a house together. Each year you take up a collection of \$1000 a head for \$~4k annual upkeep on the house. One year, a tree falls on the roof, and the house needs another \$4000 bucks. Everyone could just chip in 1k each, but one brother is having a tough year, so instead, you loan the house \$4k, with the expectation that it will pay you 1% interest a year.
  
  Your brothers agree, and over the years, this comes up a few more times. You even use debt to finance installing a new hottub. You now own \$20k in debt from the house, 1 brother owns \$5k, and for some weird reason, your neighbor Cal wants to purchase the debt from you. (He really thinks your household is trustworthy, and wants somewhere to park \$20k for 1% interest).
  
  Now C owns \$20k of debt from your house, so C owns 80% of all your house's debt. Would you say C owns your house now? Well of course not, your house is likely worth many times more what C has claim to. If someone in your house is super worried about the situation, they could take up a collection in the house to buy the debt back from C, but it's not a popular idea, because most people can think of better things to do with their money than pay off C so they don't have to make the small yearly interest payments.

"," the principal has to be repaid eventually but with majority of formal debt instruments such as government bonds the creditor can not just demand repayment whenever he or she wants. most debt instruments have pre-specified date and if not date then conditions when and how the principal is being paid back.   for example a standard 10year bond will pay its principal in 10 years not a day earlier  unless you actually manage to convince the debtor to voluntary agree to pay it sooner .   the above works for sovereign countries too. a 10 year government bond will have on it printed that principal is payed back exactly after 10years.    now this is outside economics, but technically sovereign nations are in state of anarchy so i can imagine one country could just decide to say to another pay now or we will invade you/nuke you etc. but aside of some military intervention there is no way of legally forcing the country to pay.  in fact any government can, in principle, default on its debts anytime it wants. the only constraint on sovereign default is that if you constantly default on your debt nobody will want to lend you money in the future, or if only at punitively high interest. hence on sovereign level governments as debtors have much better bargaining power than just individuals.  government can be forced to pay its debt only through military action, or in some cases by diplomatic pressure  for example eu could threaten greece by revoking its euro-zone or eu membership, us could threaten countries by economic sanctions etc. . aside from that there is nothing other country can do to get its money back if debtor nation says no.   based on 1, and 2 you probably already know the answer. no that is not possible. china could patiently wait for bonds to expire and then not buy new us bonds but instead buy australian or new zeeland bonds. of course, since there is a lot of debt being issued by us government probably every month there are bonds expiring and being replaced by new ones so china could start do it sooner than later.   also beside of that, usually when people want to get rid of a debt they will not wait for maturity and for repayment of the principal. they will take the bond to bond market and sell it at market price to get money now. that creates a trouble for country in a sense that now it has to set lower price or higher interest on its newly issued bonds due to increased supply, but whether this becomes a problem depends on plethora of factors many unrelated to the original debtor and creditor countries, such as how big is the demand for the debtors bonds etc. ",112

On r/Economics, u/ComfortableCold9 asked


  From your point of view, at what point would we [the USA in 2020] be approaching weimar? A QE program of 15 trillion? 25 trillion?


Right under, u/Bumblewurth answered


  From my point of view, never. What made hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic and (most other regimes with hyperinflation) was printing marks to pay debts in gold. The whole point of QE is to provide liquidity (already there) and to prevent deflation/meet inflation targets (not there yet.) If we're at QE with 25 trillion it's because we still haven't seen inflation in consumer prices.
  
  Inequality will be through the roof though as asset prices inflate.


u/Bumblewurth answers u/ComfortableCold9's follow-ups quoted in line.


  
    [u/ComfortableCold9 :] So seeing as we pay our debts in dollar, that suggests to me that we are effectively reliant on the dollar maintaining its strength
  
  
  [u/Bumblewurth :] No we aren't. If the dollar falls, the debts fall with the dollar. That's the difference between hyperinflationary economies in the past with non-sovereign debt and modern economies with sovereign debt. You aren't printing more dollars to chase the same amount of gold.
  
  
    But as soon as we start to see a level of inflation that would warrant a massive QT program, the economy would be held hostage.
  
  
  Economy is held hostage with deflation risk already. There's risk everywhere. That's life. But QE won't cause hyperinflation, just a whole lot of asset inflation and inequality.
  
  Most of this could be avoided if we weren't so tepid about using fiscal policy or if the fed had a fiscal tool to just send checks to everyone to manage deflation. Monetary policy is pushing on a string. But congress won't act, so here we are; Just like in 2008.



Like u/ComfortableCold9 below, I too ""don't see a difference""? 
I don't understand Bumblewurth's distinction between ""future obligations"" and ""current debts"". ""Current debts are wiped out when you monetize them"" — So what? 



  
    [u/ComfortableCold9 :] I don't see a difference here; if the dollar started to lose lose strength, you would have to print more dollars to get the same value of what you're buying.
  
  
  Yes, that's a concern for future obligations, not current debts. Current debts are wiped out when you monetize them. But once you get inflation you stop QE because the entire point of QE is to create inflation so that demand is at productive capacity. You aren't printing money to cover obligations and then printing ever more to cover the same obligations as your currency falls. You're printing more to prevent deflation. That's the point. QE and Weimar aren't related.

","if you want something  even more eli5 , try this from the atlantic:    let me unpack these one by one. right now getting the markets to buy our debt is not the problem. getting enough debt for the markets to buy is the problem. investors are so crazy to load up on treasuries that they are actually paying us to borrow, taking inflation into account. but while we are currently getting free money from investors, hungary circa 1945 was getting no money. it was an investment pariah. if hungary wanted to rebuild its economy, its only recourse was the printing press.     second, the united states is not really printing money. at least not like post-war hungary. quantitative easing is usually described as  money-printing  but it is not really. qe involves the fed buying longer-term bonds from banks. it simply swaps one asset for another -- in this case, cash for longer-term bonds. unlike hungary, the fed is not directly paying the treasury is bills. this is a hugely important distinction.    whatever money the fed  prints  is stuck in the banks. that money is not inflationary as long as the banks do not lend it out. what if the banks do start lending at a faster clip  the fed can still effectively pay the banks not lend by, for example, raising the interest on excess reserves or require the banks to set aside more money. it would be shocking for the fed not to pursue one of these options.    third, the most important difference between us and post-war hungary or weimar is that our roads have not been razed to the ground and half the country is not striking. it is very difficult to have hyperinflation when you still have a functioning economy. almost all examples of hyperinflation result from huge economic shocks that devastate an economy so much that leaders think printing money is the only solution to growth. as bad as the great recession has been, our gdp is already back to and above its all-time pre-recession high. as bad as unemployment is, more than 80 percent of the labor force is working. in zimbabwe, 80 percent of the population was unemployed.    let is conclude with a modest proposal for an economic corollary to godwin is law. the first person to reference weimar is hyperinflation in an economic debate automatically loses.   yeah, it was written in 2012... nowadays there are some fears  time will tell if justified  that people returning from the lockdowns  when those end  will cause  unexpected  inflation. but that is a different story, not really about qe.  and if you want more recent data on where us inflation is headed,  this just in :    u.s. consumer prices fell by the most in more than five years in march and further decreases are likely as the novel coronavirus outbreak suppresses demand for some goods and services, offsetting price increases related to shortages resulting from disruptions to the supply chain.    the labor department said on friday its consumer price index dropped 0.4  last month amid a tumble in the costs of gasoline, hotel accommodation, apparel and airline tickets. that was the biggest drop since january 2015 and followed a 0.1  gain in february.     the general price level decline is expected even as the federal reserve has adopted extraordinary measures to stop the economy is free-fall.  ...      the disinflationary impulse, along with the great disruption in economic and financial market activity, is a key reason why the fed is unleashing vast new monetary policy stimulus,  said gregory daco, chief u.s. economist at oxford economics in new york.  ...     excluding the volatile food and energy components, the cpi dipped 0.1  in march, the first drop since january 2010.

"As of time of writing it's quite common to see headlines about so-and-so who have tested positive for Covid-19, e.g. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau's wife, Sophie, tests positive for coronavirus, officials say

However, these articles don't usually say how reliable the testing is. I couldn't find any recent information on it via Google, either (there are some results, e.g. this, but they are old).

How accurate are the tests? What are the odds that Sophie Trudeau's results are a false positive, or that Justin Trudeau's negative result is a false negative?
","short answer: sophie trudeau is positive test may still mean 3 : 1 odds of not having contracted covid-19, but the odds could also be far more towards having covid-19. justin trudeau is negative test almost certainly means he was negative when tested. of course, should sophie be positive, that may have changed by now.    update: i found a web page of the fda listing tests that have this emergency use approval. each of them has manufacturer instuctions that list their test results towards the end. some of the submitted test results use    100 negative samples in the clinical evaluation. but there is also one that has only 13 positive cases  all of which were correctly found  in their test - but that one got the emergency approval already early in february. the latest 2  by thermo and roche  used 60/60 and 50/100 cases for their clinical evaluation  all results correct . that gets the lower end of the confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity to 94 - 97    with the lower end of the c.i. we would thus have lr       20 or 17, expected values would be 61 or 51, respectively. for lr-  lt     1/20 or 1/32  expected 1/61 or 1/100 .     long version: let is do some number juggling and see whether we can extract something useful. the following calculations are based on a somewhat worst-case scenario: the fda emergency validation guidelines specify outcomes that such a new test in the current emergency situation must meet, and i calculate from the low end of performance that could be expected meet these criteria under somewhat unlucky circumstances.  so we know minimum performance requirements, but i do not know  yet  how good    how much better than minimum performance  the tests are.  sensitivity and specificity  the starting point would be sensitivity and specificity of the respective test. i have not found any published data on these, but the fda has a policy for diagnostics testing for coronavirus disease-2019 that says how labs that develop a test should do an  emergency validation . they can then get emergency use approval.    sensitivity tells us: of all truly covid-19-positive specimen, which percentage is correctly recognized as positive by the test  i am going to use 87.5    see below  specificity tells us: of all specimen that are truly negative for covid-19, which percentage is correctly recognized by the test.   sensitivity and specificity can be measured by standardized protocols, and they characterize the performance of the test.   from a patient is or doctor is point of view, however, they are not very useful numbers as they  we  need the answer to the inverse questions:  predictive values   positive predictive value ppv: given that the test yielded positive, what is the probability that the patient truly has the virus  negative predictive value npv: given that the test yielded negative, what is the probability that the patient truly does not have the virus    predictive values can be calculated from sensitivity and specificity together with the prevalence  or, as we are talking about newly infected patients, the incidence  of virus among the tested population. here is how they go for the assumed sensitivity and specificity:   red for positive test outcomes, dark green for negative test outcomes. posterior probability   after the test said something, what is the probability that the test result is correct   npv for negative test result, ppv for positive test result.  good estimates of prevalence are often difficult to obtain, because we need the prevalence among those who are tested and that is  and should be  quite different from the prevalence of the disease in the general population.   for some countries such as italy, we have numbers of performed tests  wiki page giving numbers for more countries : as of today  march 14th , they ran 109170 tests and have a total of 21157 cases. not all tests are for initial diagnosis  afaik, a patient is considered cured only after a bunch of tests are negative , but as most cases are still  fresh , we may the ratio positive cases : tests run as one surrogate for the prevalence in the tested population. this would be around 20   for italy.   from the diagram we can then read for a new patient being tested the first time:   if the test outcome is positive, chances are     75    or greater as i am calcluating with the lower end of the possible range from the emergency validation  that the patient really has covid-19. so, up to 25   false positives.  if the test outcome is negative, chances are     95    or greater...  that the patient really does not have covid-19. so, up to 5   false negatives.    canada currently reports 25 positive out of a total of 796 tests, so about 3   prevalence in the tested population.  for the usa, the cdc reports case numbers and test numbers, currently 1629 cases with  3995   15749  tests - but it is not entirely clear to me whether the populations completely coincide. anyways, i will use 8   as guesstimate for prevalence.    prevalence   ppv   npv   country/population     ------------ ------ -------- --------------------    3     26     99.6     canada     8-9         50     98.8     usa, germany     20     75     95     italy      now that is the population of  everyone who is tested . at least for germany  march 14th  but probably also for canada and the us, tests are done on people who show symptoms and on people that are known to have had contact with corona virus cases: if they are found to be positive, they are sent home to quarantine and wait whether they did acutally catch the disease. but we may still say that the  people who are tested  population has subpopulations with and without symptoms. so if there are further point of suspicion, say, the patient does cough, we would say they belong to a high risk subpopulation with higher prevalence of covid-19 compared to the overall prevalence among tested, so the chance of a false positive would be lower for them.   this will change as tests are performed only on people who show symptoms  by now, march 16th, everyone is already told to stay at home in germany and self-isolate as well as possible - the test result will not change this in any way .   handy for quick calculation: likelihood ratio positive  lr   and negative  lr-   if we express the prevalence as odds  1 : 99 instead of 1   , lr  and lr- allow easy back-of-the envelope calculations.   lr    sensitivity /  1 - specificity      11 or better for our test and  lr-    1 - sensitivity  / specificity     0.05   1/20 or better for our test.  so they are indpendent of the prevalence and they tell us how the odds change due to the test: the posterior probability  predictive values  are the the pre-test odds multiplied with the likelihood ratio. in that sense, they tell us how much information we gain due to test  for positive and negative outcomes .  so, canada reported odds of 25 positive : 771 negative tests. so for sophie trudeau, the odds went from 25 : 771  or 3    to 25 : 771   11   273 : 771     1 : 3 or 25  . for justin trudeau 25 : 771 / 20   25 : 15420     1 : 617 or 0.16   of being covid-19 positive  slight discrepancy to above due to rounding .  on the other hand, if we start testing more and more people for whom the risk of actcually having contracted the virus is lower and lower, we soon will not be able to draw meaningful conclusions from the test results any more: i am in germany, currently the federal info page lists 3800 confirmed cases. even if we assume that there is a huge dark figure and in reality 20 x as many people are infected  that would be a prevalence in the general population of 0.1  , the odds are 1 infected : 1.5 mio non-infected. if someone who does not belong to any particular risk group were tested positive, their odds would increase by factor 11, i.e. roughly 1 : 140000. a negative test result would decrease the odds by a factor of 1/20 to 1 : 31 mio. however, both results are of no practical use as they do not change the situation: pre-test situation is  very unlikely to be covid-19 case , post-test situation is still  very unlikely to be covid-19 case .  this is why, even if there were testing capacities for the whole population, tests do not make sense unless we know there are some risk factors such as some kind of respiratory disease or contact to someone who is known to have the virus. and why it is sensible to say that on slightly suspicious circumstances    low, but not extremely low prevalence , one should self-quarantine/avoid contact but there is no point in testing  yet .    detais on how i estimate sensitivity and specificity   the lab first determines the limit of detection  lod  for virus rna. the lod here is the lowest concentration at which 19 out of 20 replicate tests are positive  that would be 95   sensitivity, but for samples spiked in the lab, but with a relevant and as difficult as possible matrix such as sputum .  next,  leftover  clinical samples are used:    as there may not be any positive samples available, the lab can spike negative samples with virus rna  a minimum of 20 samples are spiked within a range of 1 - 2 lod plus 10 samples to cover the remaining clinical range. of these, at most 1 is allowed to have negative outcome  and that must be one in the lower concentration range . thus, 29 positive out of 30 true positive.  also 30 non-reactive specimens are tested. the policy does not say a number of false positives that is permissible, so i am going to assume that must be zero.   the lab can then start with real patient samples. the first 5 positive and the first 5 negative cases must be confirmed by an approved test  and must all match .    pooling the 2  rounds  of testing clinical samples, we have:   34  or 35  positive tests out of 35 truly positive specimen -

"On healthline it's mentioned  a recent study that came out of Wuhan, China; it’s published on a website, but hasn’t yet been reviewed by peers.


  In the study, scientists looked at the blood types of 2,173 people who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and compared that with the blood types of the general population in that region.
  
  They found that in the normal population, type A was 31 percent, type B was 24 percent, type AB was 9 percent, and type O was 34 percent.
  
  In those with the virus, type A was 38 percent, type B was 26 percent, type AB was 10 percent, and type O was 25 percent.
  
  The researchers concluded that “blood group A had a significantly higher risk for COVID-19 compared with non-A blood groups. Whereas blood group O had a significantly lower risk for the infectious disease compared with non-A blood groups.”


In 'non-medical' or easy to follow terms/explanations, Why is that?

Why does blood type A is more at risk?

and Why does blood type O has less risk?

Thank you in advance
","in simpler terminology than used in the paper referred to, the observation has been made before that there is a blood group susceptibility to certain viruses, and that sars appeared to affect blood group o individuals less than group a.  group o individuals possess antibodies against the antigens displayed by group a individuals on their cells. these antibodies, anti-a, interfered with the binding of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to the ace2 receptor - like a form of neutralizing antibody or natural protection. their small studies suggested that group o individuals had 60  of the risk of the full population and group a individuals an increased risk of 120 . ab blood group risk ranged from 148-200  increased risk.  whether that is clinically useful remains to be seen. could pooled immunoglobulin from group o individuals help infected sick covid-19 patients  would any vaccine directed against this region of the virus be ineffective in group a/b individuals because they would be trying to create a vaccine against self antigens  ",66

"In libertarianism, each person is responsible for their own health.  Nobody is forced to take health insurance, and a hospital is not obliged to provide care to an individual who cannot pay for the bill (either by themselves, via insurance, or hoping for donations).  If you break your leg and can't pay for treatment, you don't get treatment.

How does the inherently individualistic libertarianism deal with the inherently collective threat of a contagious disease, which may become an epidemic?  If a sick individual is not treated, they may infect hundreds of others.  Quarantining the sick individual against their will goes against individual freedom.  In theory one could argue they may be liable for the medical costs of everyone they infect, but that is not helpful when people don't know who infected them and the infected individual can't afford treatment for hundreds of others.

Most countries deal with this threat by collectively paying for healthcare and drastically reducing the freedom of infected individuals, effectively putting them under house arrest or forcing them into hospital against their will.  Even the freedom of many healthy people is substantially reduced.  What alternatives does libertarianism propose to this, if any?
","while i have not found a reference discussing the libertarian approach to pandemics more generally, i did find one about vaccines, which should be relevant enough, because it is another, related  collective action problem :    libertarianism and collective action: is there a libertarian case for mandatory vaccination     in his paper  a libertarian case for mandatory vaccination , jason brennan argues that even libertarians, who are very averse to coercive measures, should support mandatory vaccination to combat the harmful disease outbreaks that can be caused by non-vaccination. he argues that libertarians should accept the clean hands principle, which would justify mandatory vaccination. the principle states that there is a  sometimes enforceable  moral obligation not to participate in collectively harmful activities. once libertarians accept the principle, they will be compelled to support mandatory vaccination. in my paper, i argue that the cases brennan uses to justify this principle are disanalogous to the case of non-vaccination and that they are not compelling to libertarians. the cases brennan offers can be explained by a libertarian using the individual sufficiency principle: which states that if an individual is action is sufficient to cause harm, then there is a  sometimes enforceable  moral obligation not to carry out that action. i argue that this principle is more appropriate to brennan is examples, and more appealing to the libertarian, than the clean hands principle. in order to get libertarians to accept the clean hands principle, i present a modified version of one of brennan is cases that is analogous to the case of non-vaccination. using this case, i argue that whether the clean hands principle will justify mandatory vaccination is dependent on whether the herd immunity rate in a given population is approaching a threshold after which a collective risk of harm will be imposed onto others.   so, one could say  libertarians disagree   on the exact approach  to such matters based on that discussion.  and it would not be the only thing they disagree about.   actually, there is an article in the telegraph that even says:    how can libertarians ever support mandatory quarantine and nationwide lockdowns      quite easily, as it happens. i can not speak for all libertarians  who can   but i see libertarianism as applied economics. the government should leave businesses alone unless there are demonstrable market failures and it should leave people alone unless they are doing direct harm to others.    in case it is not obvious, infecting somebody with a potentially fatal virus counts as direct harm to others....   i have not read the rest, but i am guessing he is going to argue from externalities viewpoint... which according to other libertarians  ryan bourne of cato in this case  is rapid descent on the slippery slope:    the classic recommended government remedy for this problem is to try to calculate the marginal external costs or benefits associated with a given activity  beyond the private costs or benefits  and implement taxes or subsidies so these externalities are priced in when consumption or production decisions are made. joseph stiglitz is nobel lecture is a good description of this policy solution.    given the pervasiveness of externalities, applying this logic consistently and universally would result in an extremely intrusive government.  ...     the logic of banning or adopting prohibitively high sin taxes, in contrast, is that the optimal consumption level of anything with external costs is zero. this is an absurd principle, albeit one that is regularly espoused. it is common, for example, to hear commentators and policymakers advocate for a zero-carbon economy. the uk government is recent announcement that it plans to ban all gas and diesel vehicles by the year 2040 is an example of a policy that will almost certainly impose net social costs on society.   so yeah, from this latter  more  libertarian viewpoint, how do you account for the fact that infecting others is only a probability, not a certainty   as an intermission, it would be interesting if the  father  of  paleolibertarianism  had something concrete to say on this   the probability  of infection  of others  , but insofar i was not able to find out that, but only some imperfect analogies that he made:    probably the most widely accepted doctrine within libertarianism is the  nonaggression  principle, which rothbard uses as the central theme of his book. the  nonaggression  principle states that  no man or group of men may aggress against the person or  property of anyone else   27 . thus, slavery was considered to be intrinsically evil because it  violated property rights, or the right of a person to be secure in themselves. yelling  fire   in a  crowded theater, rothbard argues, should not be restricted because free speech is only a relative  right  rather, it is criminal because it violates the private property rights of others in the theater   52 . essentially, he ascribes to the belief that individuals have an absolute right to be secure in  their persons and goes on to apply it to numerous other aspects of life. whether it be education,  roads, courts, foreign policy, or critiquing the ever-popular keynesian theory of economics,  rothbard consistently believes that the rights of the individual are incontrovertible. his beliefs  are best summed up as follows:      and, indeed, what is the state anyway but organized banditry  what is taxation but theft  on a gigantic, unchecked, scale  what is war but mass murder on a scale impossible by  private police forces  what is conscription but mass enslavement  can anyone envision a private police force getting away with a tiny fraction of what states get away with, and  do habitually, year after year, century after century   293-294       this argument continues to be the bedrock of radical libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism, as it  provides a consistent philosophy that can be applied across all aspects of life. moderate  libertarian thinkers tend to diverge from rothbard, however, on the issue of how to implement  these ideals. some, like rothbard, want sweeping change and scoff at others who argue for  gradualism. others, however, realize that government is needed in some limited capacity to  retain order and that the free market has limits.   actually lew rockwell interprets rothbard for us in the present context:    the fundamental rule for deciding whether anyone, including the government, is justified in using force to make us do something we do not want to do is the nonaggression principle  nap . as murray put in in  war, peace, and the state,   no one may threaten or commit violence   aggress   against another man is person or property. violence may be employed only against the man who commits such violence  that is, only defensively against the aggressive violence of another. in short, no violence may be employed against a nonaggressor.     you might at first think that you can use the nap to justify forced quarantines against the coronavirus. suppose someone had a deadly disease that would always spread to others if he came in contact with them. probably the person would want to isolate himself and not infect others, but if he refused, would not the people in danger be justified in isolating him  he is a threat to others, even if he does not intend to harm them.     thinking about this case can lead us astray, and here is where murray can help us most. in his great book the ethics of liberty, he says,  it is important to insist, however, that the threat of aggression be palpable, immediate, and direct, in short, that it be embodied in the initiation of an overt act. any remote or indirect criterion--any  risk  or nothreat --is simply an excuse for invasive action by the supposed wouldefender  against the alleged nothreat.   murray hammers home the point later in the book. he says,  once one can use force against someone because of his  risky  activities, the sky is the limit, and there is virtually no limit to aggression against the rights of others. once permit someone is  fear  of the  risky  activities of others to lead to coercive action, then any tyranny becomes justified.     when we apply what murray says to the coronavirus situation, we can answer our question about forced quarantines. people are not threatening others with immediate death by contagion. rather, if you have the disease, you might pass it on to others. or you might not. what happens if someone gets the disease is also uncertain.   bourne  whom one might peg in the less  paleo  camp  also comments on the covid-19 issue as well  on apr 6 :    the longer lockdowns go on, the more the income losses for businesses and households turn into bankruptcies and defaults, risking a depression. so economists recognise that the costs and benefits of policy will change over time. they will look for ways of maintaining low health risks but at lower economic and social cost than crude shutdowns, recognising this balance changes as the pandemic evolves.    indeed, once the transmission rate has been brought down and more people recover from the virus, the calculations could change drastically. if i were one of the last 50 people in the whole country to have not yet been infected, i would not expect a destructive national lockdown to protect me. so, clearly, there comes a point when it is better to relax things from an economic welfare perspective. that could come much sooner than we think.   interestingly, it still considers a/the notion of welfare to society as a whole as relevant... but in view of how much  herd  immunity there is... which actually is quite to the similar argument from the opening quote i gave in this answer.   and it is easy to get sucked into the myriad variation of responses to covid-19 of us libertarian writers/personalities/politicians  thus make this answer way too long , but i will mention here anyway that ron paul  who ran for president on a libertarian party ticket at one point , has called  april 10  for fauci to be fired because  according to paul  fauci infringed on american liberties by overestimating the number of potential deaths from covid-19.      ...  they made these dire predictions so that they could go ahead and destroy peoples  civil liberties and spend a lot of money and make up an excuse on why the stock market actually went down -- all kinds of things by having this coronavirus event blown way out of proportion,  mr. paul said.  he should be fired,  mr. paul said about dr. fauci.  ...    personality polemics aside, it seems that in most libertarian discourse the probability of infection  and death  needs to be considered, so it is not too different from how others approach the matter, but perhaps the probability is  subjectively    tuned down  at least in some us libertarian discourse. however, the most hardcore/paleo libertarians seem to reject that quantines could ever be justified.

It seems that he does not want to meet me, which makes me feel very depressed and anxious. My only option now is to write an email. I want to talk with him over several things:


Is my thesis good enough that justifies doing a PhD? If yes, is it possible that I publish it with him being coauthor?
Is it possible I become his R/a? Even if my thesis is good, that is not a guarantee.
What can I do to improve PhD chance?
Will he write me a letter of recommendation?


I think that asking all of these in one email is not a good idea. So I am thinking to start it with the email:


  Dear Prof.A, I am very grateful for your advices for my thesis.
  Without you I would not have been able to graduate. I learned a lot
  from you and now that the thesis is finished, I discovered my passion
  for research and realize that this is what I want to do for the rest

I ask because I don't recall this level of global disruption during the swine flu outbreak.
"," swine flu  is an obsolete name. the official name for the virus that was briefly called  swine flu  is  h1n1pdm09 .   h1n1pdm09 has a mortality rate of around 0.01-0.1 . that is roughly 10- to 20-fold lower than covid-19. its r0 was estimated at between 1 and 2, which is roughly half the estimates for sars-cov-2  the virus responsible for covid-19 .   a vaccine for h1n1pdm09 was available in the fall of 2010. it was possible to make it that quickly because it is just another influenza strain, and the normal techniques for for vaccines against influenza strains worked fine.   most importantly, h1n1pdm09 never went away. it is still one of the main influenza strains circulating today, and if you were vaccinated for influenza since 2010 you received a vaccine against it.    cdc info here: 2009 h1n1 pandemic  h1n1pdm09 virus  who info here: evolution of a pandemic: a h1n1  2009, april 2009 - august 2010, 2nd edition  ",116

"Current statistics on number of cases will always be a few days behind reality due to the time between infection and going to get tested, asymptomatic people, etc. But why not take a random sample of a few thousand people people, and test all of them to see how many of them have the virus? Would that not give us a picture of the proportion of people who have the virus?
","italy has 60 million people and around 70 thousand  known  cases. that is barely more than 1 in 1000 prevalence. for most countries it is less than this. so, you would need a huge sample for a good estimate. and those tests/resources are better deployed where suspected cases are, for the time being.  and sensible or not, i have heard this from a colleague, and it is confirmed by the news that romania is capital bucharest plans to randomly test a sample of 10,500 people to determine the extent of the virus spread over there.    manager of the  matei bals  infectious diseases institute adrian streinu-cercel has announced that a pilot project for testing 10,500 persons for the novel coronavirus will start in bucharest within a scientific study to detect those infected with sars cov-2 virus, from the desire to thus prevent the severe forms of illness.    streinu-cercel mentioned that, for a population of approximately 2 million inhabitants, the testing of 9,558 persons is necessary, with a correction of 10  being applied to this number. he also stated that the sample can be resized along the way. in this regard, streinu-cercel referred to the recommendations of the world health organization, which asked that testing be conducted to detect covid 19. the manager of the  matei bals  institute showed that it is necessary to test the medical staff and patients, but also the population, in order to know if  it is healthy, if it is currently infected or went through the infection  with this virus, these three pieces of information completely changing how this pandemic is approached in the near future.  ...     streinu-cercel underscored that, in lack of screening, the mild forms can go undetected, generating subsequent forms of severe infections. he also mentioned that the minister of health approved this project and stressed that this is a study with  scientific value,  not a simple testing. at the same time, he mentioned that in bucharest there are 188 people diagnosed positively.   note that  200 cases in 2m is 1:10,000.  ha, ha, the more amusing part is that this turned out to be  fake news   but it is actually informative to read the  retraction/information  as to why they are not actually doing such a study  obviously: insufficient testing capacity for the proposed sample.     after the manager of the  matei bals  institute for infectious diseases, adrian streinu-cercel and bucharest mayor gabriela firea had announced on thursday that 10,514 people from 5 different age groups in bucharest will be tested for the novel coronavirus, pm ludovic orban reacted and said this is not possible.     we cannot establish the people to be tested randomly. selecting 10,000 are just stories, there is a priority list for testing, it depends on how the situation and the testing capacity are developing,  the pm told a conference at the health ministry is hqs.    orban said that the medical staff and those targeted by the epidemiological inquiries are qualifying for testing first, adding that  romania has not been ready and the testing capacity has been limited .    the premier said that  the testing capacity in romania will increase up to 2,000 next week  and will gradually rise, but to select 10,000 people  are just stories , the more the death toll has been low in romania.   in older news i see that india conducted a random test on 500 of their citizens. rather predictably, they all came out negative.  by the way, if what you want to find out are the proportion of asymptomatic cases, there are some studies  albeit on fairly contained populations  that may have an answer to that, e.g. one on the diamond princess  the cruise ship quarantined off japan :     overall:  our estimated asymptomatic proportion is at 17.9   95 cri: 15.5-20.2  , which overlaps with a recently derived estimate of 33.3   95  confidence interval: 8.3-58.3   from data of japanese citizens evacuated from wuhan.     caveat:  considering that most of the passengers were 60 years and older, the nature of the age distribution may lead to underestimation if older individuals tend to experience more symptoms.    from a 2nd study on the diamond princess, it is informative to read the testing strategy/order:    overall 3,063 pcr tests were performed among  the 3,711  passengers and crew members. testing started among the elderly passengers, descending by age.

Can people get checks even if they haven’t filed a tax return in recent years?,"in cases where people have not filed tax returns but receive social security benefits or railroad retirement benefits, the irs can look at statements about those benefits to help get the checks to those people.  for people who have not filed a 2018 or 2019 tax return and do not receive social security or railroad retirement benefits, there is an incentive to promptly file a tax return to ensure that the irs can reach them to distribute the money to them this year.   people who do not file tax returns are typically low-income. for example, the irs requires married couples with both spouses under 65 to file returns for 2019 if their gross income was at least  24,400. that threshold is raised to  27,000 in cases where both spouses were 65 or older. social security benefits often are not included in gross income.",148

"Wikipedia lets us know that:


  A Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) is a formal declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO) of ""an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response"", formulated when a situation arises that is ""serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected"", which ""carries implications for public health beyond the affected state's national border"" and ""may require immediate international action"". Under the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR), states have a legal duty to respond promptly to a PHEIC.
  
  [...]
  
  On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19, centered on Wuhan in central China, a PHEIC. [...]


It's unclear to me from that if a WHO PHEIC declaration (and thus the obligations following from that) are limited to an area or country that the WHO decides ""to PHEIC"" or is a PHEIC declaration on some concern, e.g. this-or-that-disease ""is PHEIC'd"" automatically entails that all IHR member countries have to respond similarly, e.g. report [all] cases of that disease. So what's the (geographical) scope of a PHEIC? Does the WHO have the latitude to ""customize it""?
","a pheic declaration does not apply to a specific area - it is just that, a declaration by the who that the directory-general has determined that a public health emergency of international concern exists pursuant to article 12 of the international health regulation  2005 . paragraph 5 of article 12 states that    if the director-general, following consultations with the state party  within whose territory the public health emergency of international  concern has occurred, considers that a public health emergency of  international concern has ended, the director-general shall take a  decision in accordance with the procedure set out in article 49.   paragraph 6 of article 49 states that     the director-general shall communicate to states parties the  determination and the termination of a public health emergency of  international concern, any health measure taken by the state party  concerned, any temporary recommendation, and the modification,  extension and termination of such recommendations, together with the  views of the emergency committee.   here, states parties refers to all state parties to the ihr - so any declaration of a pheic is therefore applicable globally, and obligates state parties to notify the who of any local spread of the disease. notably, the declaration of a disease to be a pheic does not actually introduce new obligations to state parties directly, but as states are required under article 6 to    notify who, by the most efficient means of communication available, by  way of the national ihr focal point, and within 24 hours of assessment  of public health information, of all events which may constitute a  public health emergency of international concern within its territory  in accordance with the decision instrument, as well as any health  measure implemented in response to those events   the designation of the disease to be a pheic means that the event is notifiable, and as a result, the declaration of a pheic affects all state parties by definition.  however, if we refer back to article 49, note that the director-general is obligated to communicate temporary recommendations with regard to public health. these temporary recommendations are non-binding and time-limited, and are described further in article 15, paragraph 2 of which states that    temporary recommendations may include health measures to be  implemented by the state party experiencing the public health  emergency of international concern, or by other states parties,  regarding persons, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods  and/or postal parcels to prevent or reduce the international spread of  disease and avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic.   therefore, these temporary recommendations need not be globally applicable, and can apply to just one, or a few state parties.  in conclusion then, while the declaration of a pheic is applicable globally, the temporary recommendations issued as a result of the declaration are not required to be, and in general, are not.

"Disclaimer: My PhD supervisor, while not a bad person, is a bad mentor and has given me bad advice in the past. So discussing this with him isn't really productive. I have talked to other people in real life about this, and the opinion of this community would also be welcome.

I'm set to finish my PhD in theoretical physics in September 2020. I applied to several postdocs, got three interviews, and in one I was rated among the top choices but, in the end, I didn't secure any position.

I don't know how similar this is to the fields, but for context I'll explain how postdoc appointments work in (edit: high energy) theoretical physics. In my field, postdoc applications run in cycles. The majority have roughly the same application periods and deadlines (around November), most offers are made at the same time (early January following year) and they all start roughly at the same time (September). There's the occasional outlier, but that's the basic pattern. This means that it's more or less hopeless that I can continue looking for a position, ask professors, etc, for September 2020. If I wanted to stay in academia, I would need to look for a postdoc in the next cycle, starting September 2021.

I am unsure how realistic it is for me to try again or if I should simply throw the towel and quit academia.


First, there's the issue of staying one year academically idle (obviously not professionally idle, that would be insane). I could work on leftover projects from my PhD on my free time, but between finishing my PhD in September 2020 and the deadline for the next cycle on November 2020, that leaves very little time to do so. 
Second, how do I even explain the gap in my cover letter? If I flat out say I failed the previous application cycle, it's a guaranteed trip to the garbage can. Some people have recommended me just lying in vague terms, like I didn't pursue a postdoc immediately after completing my PhD due to ""health concerns that have since been resolved"". I'm unsure if this is a good idea...


If anyone has any other advice regarding my situation besides these two concerns I've raised, that would be welcome too. Basically, I would like to stay in academia as a first preference, but I have no desire to bang my head against the wall against something that, at this point, might be very close to impossible. I don't have any preference for country to work in, so feel free to give country-specific advice.
","1  first the bad news: the job situation  tenure track  in theoretical high energy physics is not good, covid will not help, having a hard time to get a first postdoc is not a good sign. having difficulty to get a postdoc is probably not your fault. there are many possible reasons, such as field not a good match, advisor not helpful, institution not a good match. however, it is not clear that the situation will be different next year.   2  in the past it has been quite uncommon for people to work in the private sector and then return to academia. if it is just a year then you can probably finish another paper or two from your graduate work, and describe your stint as gaining real world experience. i do not think it is true that people will just discard your application, but it does not improve it, either.   3  the good news is that suddenly there does appear to be a new track. if you are interested in machine learning or quantum information then you can try to get a private sector job in this area, and that does leave open the possibility of returning to academia after you have gained some experience  after two years, for example, or even later than that .

"For example, if I am trading a SP500 ETF on the NYSE, the stock exchange opens at 3:30pm CET. Due to the time shift, the stock exchanges in the EU open at 9am CET, meaning I can already gather chart information from SP500 ETFs that are traded here. 

Real life example: The SP500 ETF (even though it's the one traded on an EU stock exchange) gains a lot of value again after the corona virus crash. Is it practically possible to use this information to my advantage by immediately buying shares at the NYSE when it opens later? I know that technically the charts aren't connected with each other as each stock exchange trades it's own shares but in reality they are still correlating. 

To be fair, due to the duration of an order I think it wouldn't be possible to take advantage of this small marge, but what about big banks with higher volume and high speed trading?

"Given the recent shutdowns of many universities across the world, there's an increased interest in online education techniques.

In my case, I am a TA for a quantum chemistry class, and I'm finding it daunting to transition to online teaching. At first, I got really excited because I thought of taking advantage of this situation to run a flipped discussion section: I'd record lectures in advance, and then have virtual office hours where students could Zoom/Skype/Google hangout with me and we discuss in the same chatroom (so everyone hears the conversation). 

However, in what I suspect to be an attempt to distance themselves from something nice and free/far cheaper (like edX) which has been doing this online routine for a long time, my university has required that we livestream our lectures/discussion sections. This is purportedly to be in the aim to make their online experience as college-like as possible, but it's problematic for multiple reasons. First, lectures are at 9AM EST... Do we expect students to tune in at 10 PM in Japan? Or 3 AM in Hawaii? 

Second, we should use the silver linings present in this university shutdown: video lectures = students get to go back and re-listen to a part that confused them! From my perspective, this university requirement goes against an attempt to maintain normalcy: normalcy should not be defined as continuation of the same daily routine (impossible for many), but rather a continuation of helpful instruction.

I intend to find out whom to email about this, but in the meantime, what resources/advice would you suggest for an instructor who suddenly has to transition to the digital classroom?
","this is marked for community ownership so constructive edits will be welcomed. it is, however, more directed at those who can design a course, rather than a ta who has limited control.   background  many of the teaching techniques we use are not optimal for learning. they have been designed for economic efficiency since they scale. some of them have been a bit obsolete since the creation of the internet. but face to face classes in real time are no longer necessary. lecture is efficient  one teacher, many students, synchronous , but again, not optimal. testing is a poor way to guarantee competence. this current emergency can be considered to be an opportunity to rethink everything we do toward finding better ways to educate people. we are forced to act and the old ways do not work in a new environment. we should be looking for new ways.   the essentials of teaching are delivery, practice, feedback, assessment. all of these require two way communication. they do not require synchronicity or exams. the first job is to teach people, not to grade them. if you get that part backwards then you are only  teaching  people who do not need to be taught.   every student is different. nearly every student learns differently from the way their instructor does. the instructor has been proven to stand out in a particular system in which others have failed. as an instructor you have an obligation to every student willing to put in the effort, not just to the ones naturally predisposed to  win  in some system. not every student starts at the same place with the same understandings. the same words do not necessarily have the same meanings to different people.   some people have handicaps that prevent certain kinds of interactions. hearing impairment and vision impairment are obvious ones, but there are others.   learning is individual, but the process need not require isolation. it can be a communal process with learners helping each other. denying students the option of working together is sub-optimal. a course can be a communal activity, not a hierarchical one.   some students will succeed no matter the system. they do not really need you for anything more than pointing to important sources/ideas. but most actually require your assistance since insight into a topic can be hard to come by. many students actually need to be taught how to learn. if you change the system of learning they may need to be retaught how to internalize ideas and turn them into competencies. it is not automatic or obvious.   learning is not  consuming  material. it requires active participation. it requires a change in the brain  the art of changing the brain by james e zull   all of these things have long been taken into account in designing educational systems, but the current practice is a compromise that values economic  scale  values over educational ones. not everywhere, of course, but the exceptions seem few to me.   let is assume that everything is on the table, except that students and instructors can no longer meet face to face in groups. meetings of any kind need to be small and optional with alternatives provided. computer communication of some kind is needed, but costs are an issue as is the privacy of all participants.   what to do, what to do.   ideas for delivery  there are a lot of ways for students to have access to the material of a course. books are traditional. lecture has replaced most other methods. but lectures are longer than they need to be. some research i read suggests that lectures of 10 to 15 minutes are more efficient than hour or longer lectures  http://spokenimpact.com/what-is-the-ideal-length-for-a-presentation/ . those contemplating video should take note of that. video also needs to be accompanied with a transcript to aid those with impairments.   moreover, students need to be able to review material. video is difficult in this regard since it is hard to quickly return to a small part that needs review without watching longer sections, which leads to boredom. transcripts can mark the time that important ideas are introduced.   there is a fine line between having good and poor production values in video. if they are too good, a video talk becomes just entertainment with poor learning, unless other means are used to encourage/enforce engagement. if they are too bad, then students will get lost and frustrated. video professionals are good at this sort of thing, but it is hard to bootstrap immediately at scale.  delivery alone is just media. students need to incorporate what they see in a lecture, long or short, into their long term memory and into their effective competencies. more is involved than the eyes and ears. students often think that the will automatically  learn  what is presented to them in a lecture, talk, demonstration, etc. but it is anything but automatic.   caveats: any  solution  that requires real-time synchronous presence on the internet will probably fail. and it will fail invisibly for some. connections are dropped, servers overload, etc. it is hard enough to keep students off their phone when in a class. it is probably impossible to do in a real-time internet lecture. other distractions will intrude. moreover, unless you have an exceptional communication system, students will not be able to interrupt you when you make a mistake, as you will. no questions are likely to be asked in real time. it is also difficult for a presenter to give a lively talk with no audience feedback at all. especially if you are trying to do this under emergency conditions without training and experience.   but if you absolutely must use synchronous delivery you need to do two additional things. the first is that you need to record and post your lectures so that those who must miss the original do not lose access.   the second, just as vital, is that you provide a real time feedback to yourself  or to an assistant sitting by your side  so that questions can be asked as you lecture and so that students have a way to mention/note errors you make.   and make sure that students know what to do in the case that you lose the server and the ability to broadcast. avoid chaos and uncertainty as much as possible.   ideas for practice  student practice exercises and tasks may not need to change much. students, depending on the field, need to write, solve problems, and other things as appropriate. for the most part this can probably proceed largely unchanged. instructors have access to many such student exercises. if the students have a text book they probably have a bank of suitable exercises and questions.   and note that practice and reinforcement is probably the most important element in a delivered education. the  content  that a student needs is, for the most part, available to them. there are exceptions for very advanced work, but the world is knowledge is pretty much available. instructors help students choose the important things and avoid the garbage, of course, but it is up to the students themselves to learn by reinforcement  combined with feedback . whatever the topic, competence comes from repetition and reinforcement. the only thing i teach nowadays is tai chi. we have a saying that you need to repeat a movement ten thousand times to learn it. somewhere in those ten thousand tries, insight will start to develop. the same is true in things like mathematics and writing poetry.   so, remember that the things that you make the students do to learn are much more important than the things you say. good course design focuses on the student tasks, not the lectures.   i caution, however, that copyright considerations may apply if an instructor tries to utilize exercises from copyrighted material. they are, in a sense, publishing things they send to students in an online course. caution and legal advice is useful.   ideas for feedback  feedback is two way. you need feedback from the students on your presentations and assignments. students need feedback on their own work. a number or letter grade on a paper is not feedback. it gives no basis for understanding how to improve.   if the materials presented are well vetted, such as textbooks, the need for feedback to the instructor is a bit lessened. but videos, especially those prepared in the moment are likely to contain errors. shorter videos are easier to fix than longer ones. but, unlike face to face classes, the instructor is not likely to be interrupted when there is a misstatement or an omission. moreover, you need some indication that the students have actually understood what you have been saying and presenting. again, in fact to face classes you can look at expressions on their faces for some important feedback.   lets assume for the moment that you have already taught your students the importance of taking notes during presentations. at the end of a lecture you can ask individual students, perhaps volunteers, to tell you an important idea from the talk. you can do this two or three times and give them feedback on their replies. this can be transferred to online learning. if readings or video presentations are short  and, i assume asynchronous  you can ask students to send you a summary of the lesson. restrict them to one or two sentences. another possible request is to ask them to send you a possible exam question on that material. at some point, all student replies, perhaps anonymized, can be made available to everyone. by glancing through the replies you learn whether they are getting the main points and they are also getting the reinforcement they need.   giving feedback to students on their work is critical to learning. this involves answering questions that they have, but also showing them where they are making mistakes, and why, in their own work. the previous section talked about repetition and reinforcement. it is possible for students to learn and reinforce the wrong message. if you get an incorrect idea deeply ingrained in your mind it can be difficult to dislodge. all student work needs to be commented on, not just graded. publishing solutions to exercises after the fact can help, but it is not the same thing.   this idea of individual feedback is one of the most difficult things to arrange in the modern educational system, simply because of scale. my university teaching  and student life  mostly involved classes of fewer than 30 students. at that scale, i could easily give good individual feedback on weekly assignments. at 40 students i found i needed help. massive courses have a problem here that requires tools - probably better tools than are now available. i will note that harvard is cs50 course is delivered to about 800 students at a time. but the staff for the course is about 40 individuals, so the ratio is about 20:1. some of the staff are graders who comment on student work. others are tas who hold individual  recitation  sections of 20-30 students so that questions can be answered and misconceptions dispelled. i worry that moving such recitation online might not work as well at scale unless there are communication tools that let people learn from the questions of others. many students are reluctant to ask questions. the brave students willing to do so actually contribute to the education of their peers. but, answering a question for a single student, say in an office, is much less productive than answering it in public, so that all can share the response. tools are needed for this, though they can be pretty simple. university managed email lists subscribed to by students and staff are pretty effective.   but if students produce  papers  of any kind, those need to be annotated and returned. more than a numeric or letter grade is needed. something as simple as pointing a student to a place they need to review is helpful. but the goal is to foster insight. pdf files can be annotated and returned, but the process is awkward at best. and, again, there is the scale problem. it takes time to review and time to annotate. then, the student will likely have questions that need to be addressed based on the annotations. the increase in awkwardness using current tools may require more staffing to make things work effectively. even a simple email to a student takes more time than jotting a comment on a paper and then returning it at the next face session.   ideas for assessment  in my view, evaluation and assessment are the most difficult issues we face in moving to an internet model. however, they also, again in my view, have the most potential for long term improvements in student learning, provided that we take the opportunity to learn how to do a better job of it.   the first principle of assessment ought to be that any sort of evaluation have an actual educational purpose, not just a  sorting  purpose. i think that many of us are not doing a stellar job of this, having opted for easy solutions that scale, rather than solutions that aid student learning. multiple choice tests are overused and while it is possible to design good ones, it is devilishly difficult. things that rely on machine grading in general are too likely to also rely on only shallow learning and memorization, rather than deep learning and mastery. if the students can be held in a room and closely monitored this sort of thing tells you something about them, but it can likely be better. move them outside your purview and it becomes nearly impossible. and it even fails at scale.   while you can do some technological things to lock up a student is personal computer they are intrusive but also ineffective. you can enlist a vast army of tas to monitor student webcams  intrusive, again  but even there, what happens slightly off screen is invisible. without such intrusive measures students have access to helpers both human and electronic. closed-book, closed notes exams are probably a mistake in any case, but online they are difficult to impossible to monitor. there are too many inducements for students to break the rules to really assure validity. honor codes, such as those of dartmouth college do have a positive effect, but part of that effect is that the codes have been in place for half a century.   i have some personal suggestions about alternatives to examinations and, especially, high stakes examinations such as finals that account for a large fraction of a students grade. i do not claim these are the only solutions, but am more interested in sparking thoughts about how we can do a better - more learning focused - job of evaluation and assessment. i implemented these more and more as my career progressed and i learned more about students and about learning.   the first idea is to reduce the overall effect of any given exam or test. if you have forty small items you can get at least as good a picture of a student is progress as if you have only one or two large ones. moreover, high stakes testing too often leads to poor student studying habits, such as cramming for exams and cheating.   one technique i used toward the end was  cumulative grading . a course had 1000 points assigned to it and different student activities were  worth  a certain amount of points. a project might be 100 points. the result was evaluated  and commented on  and a certain number of points was awarded, perhaps 80. i also published the minimum number of points necessary for each letter grade, say 800 for a b. when a student accumulates enough points to  earn  the grade they desire they no longer need to do more. there was no risk. another feature of it was that if the student was not satisfied with the points earned they could re-do the work and possibly earn additional points. some limits were put in place, but they were generous. the philosophy behind it is  you are not in this course to prove to me that you do not need to be here.  but note that i could do this since the ratio of staff to students was good. this is hard to scale without help.   the second main technique i used and can recommend is to make almost all assessment and evaluation based on student writings and projects, not examinations. and, if the nature of the course permits, use group projects primarily. for my courses the group size was usually between two and five. these groups can meet in cyberspace or, if location and other factors permit, they can meet face to face. the projects might be large or small. they can be graded once or often. points can accumulate. it is the project that is graded, not the individuals, so everyone earns the same grade unless that is impossible. peer evaluation is used to award bonus points or to solve issues of non-participation, etc.   if there are a number of group projects students can move between groups if needed. but students also need to be taught how to run an effective group project. in the courses i taught, dividing up the work  equally  was always discouraged and if done, usually leads to poor outcomes. students need to form teams, not just amalgamations of individuals. in cs this skill will be valued later in their careers.   also, peer evaluation has to be properly managed. students do not  grade  one another. they comment on the contributions of a few or all of their team mates.  who was the most helpful team member   or three top members  why  what did they contribute  what was your own chief contribution     at a certain scale or with sufficient help you can easily determine who falls into which important grading groups. who is excellent in all respects  who shows promise  who is getting by  who is deficient  who has failed  elaborate point systems in which an 85 is somehow significantly different from an 87 have little real meaning in my opinion.   to emphasize a point above. in many fields, even very technical ones, writing is an important skill. writing essays on a given topic is good professional preparation for a budding mathematician. exams can be replaced with such essays, lessening the needs for security and such. they seem to me to be much more value long term than skill at exams. but you can probably expect that students will hate it initially.   the above, of course, are just ideas. but i found them to be more aligned with the teaching mission than the more traditional lecture and test.   ideas for communication  to handle all of the above with online courses the main need is for effective communication between faculty and students and, i found, between students themselves. one goal is that what any student sees can be seen by any other student.   communication tools need not be complex or comprehensive. but they should permit asynchronous communication and should permit many-way communication. threaded email lists are very useful and do not require extensive facilities. they can be private lists, managed by the university alleviating some privacy issues, open to only class members and staff. documents can be distributed. questions can be asked. questions can be answered at any time of the day or night - even by other students. someone needs to monitor these to make sure that misinformation is quickly corrected and that any rules about posting or not posting certain content are maintained.   if project groups are long lived, then each group can have its own mailing list and can also use other tools they find for communication.   another useful tool is a group chatroom. group chats can be held periodically, though the email lists were more useful for discussing course material. these are necessarily synchronous and so not every student might be able to  attend . but it is easy to capture the complete conversation as a text file and send it to everyone or post it on a course web site.     my own expertise in this comes from helping to design and deliver a graduate program in which students met face to face only once a month for half a day per course. all work was done in groups  of about 5 . face time was only used for things that could not be done on line. we used simple tools for communication. all student-professor communication  other than personal things  was open to all students. students could ask questions at any time and other students were encouraged to answer from their own expertise. the course was always live, every hour, every day. questions got answered quickly, if not always perfectly. students did not get stuck. the goal was to build a learning community. that community has persisted past graduation.     minor updates only anticipated.     an interesting alternative view can be found here: http://anygoodthing.com/2020/03/12/please-do-a-bad-job-of-putting-your-courses-online/. thanks to user curious for pointing

"I am trying to travel to Austria from Brussels by train, and have conflicting information on the status of cancellations due to Covid-19.

According to Eurail, ""all rail services from Germany to Austria are cancelled until further notice""
https://www.eurail.com/en/help/travel-disruptions/coronavirus-update

Yet, Deutsche Bahn and the 'trainline.eu' both allow me to book high-speed ICE trains across the border, just not the Nightjet trains. There are notices saying that there are delays/reduced services expected at the border, but it is not impossible to book like it is for other trains.

My questions:


does this mean that it is still possible to take the high-speed ICE trains?
if not, is there any other way that it is permitted to travel over the German border to Austria (e.g. by bus, coach or taxi)? Unfortunately driving is not an option.

","the official website of deutsche bahn lists the current interruptions due to corona  only in german, trying to change the language to english took me back to the main page :   http://www.bahn.de/p/view/service/aktuell/index.shtml  according to this site, several trains between germany and austria have been cancelled, including the nightjet, but i assume that other trains are still running. since the site does not mention ice trains between germany and austria, i assume they are still running.  in case the trains stop running before you make it to austria: if you are eligible to enter austria, nothing should stop you from entering by taxi  or, taking a taxi to the german side of the border, crossing the border by foot, ordering another taxi to pick you up at the austrian side of the border  - but depending on how close to the border you can get by train this can be quite expensive.   i would not count on buses or coaches: they have never been quite as popular as trains, and the one company that offered  more or less  regular coach services - flixbus - stopped operations tonight due to corona.

"I would like to have a confusing part of medicine cleared up. My experience of medical intervention is as follows.


As pointed out in the answer to Does taking antibiotics make you immune to virus? antibiotics do not work on viruses.
If I go to a doctor when suffering from the common cold, I am told to ride it out and take paracetamol for aches and pains. That makes sense as the common cold is caused by a virus.
If visiting the doctor because a chest infection arises however, a course of antibiotics is often prescribed.


How does a doctor manage to determine that the chest infection is a bacterial infection rather than a viral infection from the common cold virus?

If the bacterial infection arose out of a common cold infection, why is it the bacterial infection occurred and not a viral infection?
","this is actually a pretty complicated question because viral infections can damage the lungs in a way that makes subsequent bacterial infections possible/likely and it is often these that are fatal. so if co-occurring both may need to be treated, with different medications, or the viral infection may be ignored sometimes. it basically depends on the severity of the pneumonia  which i am guessing it is what you mean by  chest infection  . for some background on causes of pneumonia:    pneumonia is an infection of the lung that causes the alveoli, or air sacs, to fill up with fluid or pus.  ...  if pneumonia does not resolve it can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome  ards , sepsis, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and decreased pulmonary function.    there are several viral infections that lead to pneumonia  16 . influenza a virus  iav  primarily infects the lung epithelium, and can cause viral pneumonia.  ...  there are also a variety of other viruses that can infect the lower respiratory tract and lead to pneumonia, including respiratory syncytial virus  rsv , parainfluenza, human metapneumonia, and some adenoviruses  14, 18-22 . rhinoviruses and newly described coronaviruses also infect the respiratory tract and cause disease.  ...     a variety of bacteria can also lead to the development of pneumonia. bacterial pathogens as well as opportunistic infections  also known as pathobionts  can lead to pneumonia when allowed to infect the lower respiratory region. bacteria that cause lrtis naturally colonize the nasopharynx, but can cause disease when allowed to proliferate in the lower respiratory region  24-28 . the most common examples of these are streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus. other bacteria are acquired from the environment, and often these bacteria have specific virulence factors that allow for the adaptation and infection of the lower respiratory tract  29 .  ...     the vast majority of research in infection biology has been devoted to studying the interactions of a single pathogen with a host. in addition to single infections causing pneumonia, a common complication following infection with respiratory viruses is bacterial pneumonia  9, 26, 39-56 .many clinical infections and presumably subclinical infections are often in fact coinfections, in that two  or more  pathogens simultaneously or in close temporal proximity infect a single host  9, 26, 39-59 . these infections are termed secondary infection, superinfection, or coinfection. the simultaneous response of two pathogens can manifest in many ways and often results in increased morbidity and mortality.     to determine the best treatment options for patients with complex viral/bacterial coinfections increased understanding of the interplay between pathogens and the interaction with the host is necessary. several viruses and bacteria have been shown to interact to worsen clinical outcomes. it is now believed that most of the deaths associated with the 1918 influenza pandemic were caused by superinfection with bacteria  60, 61 . iav/s. pneumoniae coinfection is perhaps the most well-studied example of viral/bacterial coinfection of the lung  62 . however, bacterial coinfection also complicates infection with other respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus, metapneumonovirus, rsv, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and coronavirus  52, 63-66 . young children are especially vulnerable to bacterial complications following viral infection  44, 62, 67, 68 .   so the nice  i.e. uk  guidelines for diagnosing pneumonia say for example:    community-acquired pneumonia  cap  is a lower respiratory tract infection most commonly caused by bacteria  however, viruses are thought to cause approximately 13  of cases in adults, and approximately 66  of cases in children and young people. the main bacterial pathogen causing cap is streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by haemophilus influenzae  epidemics of mycoplasma pneumoniae occur approximately every 4 years in the uk, and mainly affect children.    inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for respiratory tract infections is common in general practice.  ...    so if you are an adult suffering from pneumonia  the covid-19 pandemic aside  chances are you more likely you have bacterial pneumonia.    ng120 also emphasises the importance of face-to-face clinical examination in patients with acute cough if prescription of an antibiotic is being considered. clinicians should therefore avoid issuing antibiotics for cough without a face-to-face examination. if bacterial pneumonia is suspected, it is important to assess the clinical signs and to determine their severity.  ...     an antibiotic should be offered within 4 hours of establishing a diagnosis of pneumonia, and a 5-day course is considered appropriate in all severity gradings.   also worth quoting from those guidelines:    in practice, patients often return at the end of the antibiotic course due to concerns that symptoms have not resolved  however, in pneumonia, we should not expect symptom resolution at this stage. when issuing an antibiotic, it is important to explain to patients that their symptoms are highly unlikely to have resolved at the end of the course, but that the infection will have been adequately treated. it may be helpful to bear in mind that chest x-rays are not expected to return to normal for up to 6 weeks after pneumonia, reflecting the ongoing inflammatory rather than infective process.    sputum samples do not need to be routinely sent for patients with cap treated in primary care. however, they can be useful if signs or symptoms have not improved as expected after antibiotic treatment, or in people who have previously had frequent courses of antibiotics, as this increases the likelihood of resistant organisms.   basically, unless the pneumonia is severe enough  to require hospitalization , you will not get a test to determine the agent that caused it, unless the first course antibiotic does not resolve it.  i can tell you from general experience that the cause of pneumonia will get tested in severe cases in a hospital setting in almost any country.  there are probably some who guidelines for this, but i can not be bothered to search them now.   short coda on covid-19:    a study of 191 patients in two wuhan hospitals showed that 50 percent of those who died tested positive for secondary infections compared to only one of the 137 survivors. in this situation, antibiotics form a crucial second line of defence. many studies indicate that nearly all severe covid-19 patients will receive antibiotics.

","can someone die of the common cold   no.  the common cold is a clinical syndrome restricted to upper respiratory tract involvement. by clinical syndrome, i mean it is the constellation of symptoms  rather than the consequence of a specific pathogen . as you mention, these symptoms are the result of the immune response, rather than tissue damage or compromised function as a direct effect of a pathogen or its toxin  e.g., the watery diarrhea in cholera .   as defined  see, e.g., cecil medicine ch. 369 , this clinical syndrome cannot lead to death.     the common cold is an upper respiratory syndrome of rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction, frequently accompanied by sore throat, sneezing, and cough.   can the viruses that cause the common cold cause death   yes. many viruses that cause the common cold also cause other clinical syndromes that can cause death. this occurs when viral replication moves to the lower respiratory tract. as an example, influenza viruses are responsible for 25 - 30  of common colds  see bennett, principles and practice of infectious disease, ch.58 . when it moves beyond the upper respiratory tract, influenza is responsible for substantial mortality. other virus families that are responsible for both a common cold syndrome and lower respiratory tract syndrome in immunocompetent individuals  e.g., bronchiolitis, pneumonia  include parainfluenza virus, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and  rarely  coronavirus. rhinovirus, responsible for 40-50  of common cold cases, is uniquely unsuited to lower respiratory tract involvement, because of its preference for the cooler environment of the nasal mucosa, replicating best at 33 c  murray medical microbiology, ch 56 . however, in individuals with severe combined immunodeficiency  scid , lower respiratory tract involvement does occur. there are a number of case series reporting death due to lower respiratory rhinovirus. this is an example.  can the common cold lead to serious illnesses other than lower respiratory tract involvement   yes. other morbidity can occur as a result of the immune response that produces the common cold syndrome. rhinorrhea and congestion can progress to a viral rhinosinusitis, a separate syndrome with its own complications, or a secondary bacterial infection, which can lead to bacterial sinus involvement and/or bacterial lower respiratory tract infection. otitis media is another common complication, especially in children, and has its own potential complications. asthma  and, generally speaking, most lung diseases  can also be exacerbated by what would otherwise be a simple common cold and predisposes to lower respiratory tract involvement. asthma does deserve special mention, because rhinovirus associated exacerbations can be fatal, but this is a consequence of asthma rather than a common cold syndrome. further discussion of these syndromes are beyond the scope of the question, but are discussed briefly in the chapters referenced above.

"Why is providing contraception/ family planning, as well as family planning services and information, important during the COVID-19 pandemic?","contraception and family planning information and services are life-saving and important at all times. sexual activity does not cease with the covid-19 pandemic, it is therefore crucial to ensure that people are able to access rights-based services and information to initiate and / or continue use of contraception. by preventing unintended pregnancies, contraception helps to protect girls and women from the negative health consequences of unintended pregnancies, which can save their lives. contraception reduces the need for abortion, meaning that women and girls are less at risk of unsafe abortion, which again can be lifesaving. condoms, when used consistently and correctly, help to prevent both unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections  including stis . in addition, by preventing the negative health consequences associated with unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted infections  including hiv , contraception can help alleviate unnecessary additional pressure on already-stretched health systems which are working hard to address covid-19.",33
"How long does the virus live on different surfaces?
