127,biomedical,health.stackexchange.com,"As the German chancellor said today, by the end of the year 60-70% of the population will have been through a COVID-19 infection. Where does that number come from?

The basic mechanism is clear, and the magnitude is plausible: Let n be the average number of persons infected by one infected person. If n falls below 1, then the epidemy will run out. This will happen if an infected person mostly hits persons who are already immune.

The question is: Why just 60-70%, not 40-50 or 80-90%? Does it come from historic precedence? Or from some formula that takes into account the value of n (the value before saturation has set in)? What citation classics could serve as reference?
","Some Canadian experts said 35% to 70% will be infected:


  According to a disease-transmission model developed by University of
  Toronto researchers, the virus’ overall attack rate in Canada could
  exceed 70 per cent. That number drops sharply, by about half, “if we
  add modest control,” said epidemiologist Dr. David Fisman, one of the
  model’s creators, but it will take “aggressive social distancing and
  large scale quarantines” to reduce it further, he said.
  
  “That’s still a huge number of people ill, and critically ill people
  are a large fraction in this disease,” Fisman said in an email. “I’m
  not going to share more specific numbers because I think they will
  scare people to no particular end.”


In reality no one knows. I can tell you if they contain the spread no more people will be infected. If they don't contain the spread more people will be infected. Steps like Italy took today where only essential work can occur and all business closed except transportation, grocery stores and pharmacies are a desperate attempt at containment that may be too late. That said given recent numbers it appears to have worked for China.

The German Chancellor is wasting her time and ours spewing off meaningless numbers that will only serve to scare citizens of the nation she is supposed to lead. Something better would be her plan to make the homeless self-isolate for 14 days at home if they come into contact with someone who was positive or preemptively positive.

Today the WHO leader said if American governments (Federal, State, County, City, etc) do not act it could be ""many, many millions"" dead in the USA. Today's US government talk to borrow 40 billion dollars to spend on the pandemic is not a plan.
","This is a rough estimate based on how contagious this virus is to provide a guess on when herd immunity can be reached.


  Rough estimates indicate that herd immunity to Covid-19 would be reached when approximately 60% of the population has had the disease


https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-51892402

The percentage needed for herd immunity depends on the virus.  So, for measles, it is required that about 95% of the community be immune before herd immunity is effective for your local population.

631,general,travel.stackexchange.com,"Someone I know booked a return flight on Air Serbia from Vienna to Podgorica (Montenegro) via Belgrade, departing on 6 March 2020 and returning on 14 March 2020.  On 10 March 2020, Air Serbia cancelled the return leg from Belgrade to Vienna without explanation; the passenger contacted Air Serbia by phone, who rebooked them on the next available flight, 24 hours later than the original return date.  Air Serbia told them on the phone that reasonable transport, meal, and accommodation costs for the unplanned overnight stay in Belgrade would be compensated.

According to Air Serbia's statement of passenger rights*, the EU Regulation 261/2004 on flight compensation is integrated into Serbian law, so we assume that the passenger is entitled not only to the costs for the stay in Belgrade, but also €250 in compensation for the cancelled flight.

The passenger accordingly made a claim for compensation (both the overnight expenses and the €250 cancellation award) using Air Serbia's online form*, including all the relevant travel information and documentation (receipts, etc.).  Air Serbia just now rejected the claim as follows:


  Thank you for your patience while the claim relating to your journey from BEG to PRG on 14.3.2020 was processed.
  
  After carefully reviewing your claim, I regret to inform you that we are not able to provide compensation in this case. This decision was reached taking into account the specific circumstances of your case, due to the coronavirus pandemic. Please note that the decision is final.
  
  We’re sorry that our service on 14.3.2020 did not meet your expectations and hope that we can look forward to welcoming you on-board an Air Serbia flight in the future.


We are skeptical about this rejection for the following reasons:


On the phone, Air Serbia had already promised compensation at least for the transport, accommodation, and meals in Belgrade.
Air Serbia cancelled the flight before the governments of Serbia and Austria had imposed any restrictions on foreign travel relating to the coronavirus pandemic.
At no time before now had Air Serbia indicated that the cancellation was due to the pandemic.
According to the answer to another Covid-19–related question here (May I get a refund for a flight cancelled because of COVID-19?), ""under EU rules you always get a refund"".


We would therefore like answers to the following:


Under Serbian or EU law (whichever is applicable in our case), is the passenger in fact entitled to compensation in this case?
If the answer to the previous question is ""yes"", then to what enforcement body can the passenger appeal Air Serbia's final decision?  The EU helpfully provides a list of national enforcement bodies for EC 261/2004, but Serbia is not on this list.  If there's no national enforcement body in Serbia, can the passenger appeal to the one in Austria, given that she bought the ticket and is resident there?




* Note that due to Air Serbia's broken website, you may need to follow that link twice before the correct page appears.  It seems that first-time visitors to the website are always redirected to its home page.
","The €250 compensation doesn't apply in extraordinary circumstances beyond the airline's control. While it's not certain that this applies, it's highly likely now during Covid-19.

However, extra expenses (accommodation, food) are to be reimbursed, per Article 9 of the EC261 regulation.

So contact them again and mention this (of course, attach the receipts). Tell them that Article 9 of EC261 applies regardless of any extraordinary circumstances.

And if you want to be dead certain if extraordinary cirumstances apply or not (i.e. whether or not the €250 compensation is due), ask a firm such as Claimcompass to investigate it.

211,expert,law.stackexchange.com,"Apparently, a new coronavirus related paid family leave law takes effect on 04/01/2020. I understand that, among commercial companies, it applies only to those under 500 employees (because, of course, companies that can afford lobbying cannot be burdened, but that's unrelated to the question.) The questions I have regarding that law:

1) Does the new extended leave law apply to federal employees? More specifically, my wife works for Veterans' Affairs, and we'd like to figure out whether she qualifies. On one hand, VA has more than 500 employees, but on the other hand, VA is not a commercial company, and I don't see in the reports specifics regarding the government employees.

2) Would a mother of small children qualify for paid family leave to watch them while the schools are closed? This has become quite an issue as soon as the schools closed for the year.
","The Department of Labor has a page about the law.  Some excerpts (boldface mine):


  Most employees of the federal government are covered by Title II of the Family and Medical Leave Act, which was not amended by this Act, and are therefore not covered by the expanded family and medical leave provisions of the FFCRA. However, federal employees covered by Title II of the Family and Medical Leave Act are covered by the paid sick leave provision. 


And as to your Question 2:


  Generally, the Act provides that employees of covered employers are eligible for:
  
  Two weeks (up to 80 hours) of paid sick leave at two-thirds the employee’s regular rate of pay because the employee is unable to work because of a bona fide need to care for an individual subject to quarantine (pursuant to Federal, State, or local government order or advice of a health care provider), or to care for a child (under 18 years of age) whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19, and/or the employee is experiencing a substantially similar condition as specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretaries of the Treasury and Labor; and
  
  Up to an additional 10 weeks of paid expanded family and medical leave at two-thirds the employee’s regular rate of pay where an employee, who has been employed for at least 30 calendar days, is unable to work due to a bona fide need for leave to care for a child whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19.

  (14) As under the Montreal Convention, obligations on operating air carriers should be limited or excluded in cases where an event has been caused by extraordinary circumstances which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken.


You don’t book with Expedia

Expedia is an aggregation service provider, they put you in touch with the supplier (who pays them) for you to book with. They are not a traditional travel agent acting as an intermediary.

So, no matter what, you can’t get your money from them.

What does the contract say?

We have already established that the regulation requiring a refund has excluded itself so the first thing to look at is your contract and why Air France cancelled the contract. They could have cancelled it because a government prohibited the flight, or because it was unsafe to make the flight, or because it was uneconomic, or ... 

As an added complication, you might have been prohibited from taking the flight even if it had been operated depending on your nationality and government restrictions at the time, if so, the cancellation of the flight has caused you no damage beyond that which you suffered from the government decree

The first step is to read your contract and find out who bears the risk for each of those eventualities and what has to be done. If the contract says you get a refund, you get a refund, if it says you get a credit, you get a credit. Ultimately, if there is a complete and utter failure of consideration, you are entitled to a refund - that is if they cannot provide you with a flight within a reasonable time. In theory, when this all ends, they could contact you and say, “we can fly you tomorrow” - they would then have fulfilled their obligation even if you don’t want to fly tomorrow. Legally, this is fine, commercially, it would be a disaster.

Force Majeure

This obscure area of contract law has become very relevant at this time. It means “superior force” and deals with what happens when a party is unable to fulfil its obligations under a contract through unforeseen in the contract and unforeseeable in practice events beyond either parties control. That is, between the parties, who took the risk of that unforeseeable event?

If the contract is silent then, under French (civil) law, Air France is relieved of its contractual obligations, that is, they are not in breach of their contract and are not subject to damage. However, if the contract is under Common (English/US etc.) law then they have breached their contract and owe you damages. Whose law is the contract under? You’ll have to read it.

Consumer protection law

This adds another level of complexity.

120,biomedical,health.stackexchange.com,"There's a ridiculous conspiracy theory spreading that coronavirus is a genetically modified biological weapon gone rogue. According to one theory, the virus has traces of HIV and is designed to attack the immune system. My question isn't related to the evidence, which is non-existent, supporting this theory but rather the science behind the claim.

HIV can only spread via blood, semen, pre-seminal fluids, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. Is it even conceivable that an ""HIV like"" virus could spread through the air like coronavirus? The conspiracy theory isn't saying you will get full-blown AIDS but that coronavirus can ""attack the immune system"" (in a way mimicking HIV). I'm not a doctor, but on the surface, the claim that a virus could even somewhat operate like HIV and be airborne sounds absurd.

Several scientists have already said there's no way coronavirus DNA was engineered, but I'm looking for another angle to attack this conspiracy theory.

""There's absolutely nothing in the genome sequence of this virus that indicates the virus was engineered,"" Richard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, told The Washington Post Sunday.

","New York State

Yes, I know that you don't live in New York State. This is however the most useful and explanatory document that I have found on this matter and therefore linked it as further information.   

Mercury Levels Tests are performed either with urine or with blood in the New York State. 


  The most commonly accepted methods of assessing mercury exposure are
  to test urine or blood. Both tests usually measure levels of total
  mercury (elemental, inorganic and organic).     
  
  
  Elevated mercury in urine usually indicates exposure to an elemental or inorganic source
  of mercury, such as from a job that uses mercury. 
  Elevated mercury
  in blood usually indicates exposure to organic mercury (such as from
  eating fish containing methylmercury) or recent exposure to a high
  level of elemental mercury vapor. For most people, an elevated blood
  mercury level is associated with eating fish and other seafood
  containing organic mercury.     
  


(Source: New York Health Department)

In New York State, it is mandatory to report high level of mercury in blood or urine tests to the New York State Department of Health. Therefore, if anyone in New York had underwent a blood or urine test, they would have been notified if there are high mercury levels. (New York Health Department)

Massachusetts

It was a bit more challenging to find sources for Massachusetts. However, if one digs deep this is what I could find:

The Confidential Report Form for the State of Massachusetts states that all persons with mercury blood levels higher than 15 μg / L or urine mercury levels higher than 35 μg / g creatinine must be reported. (Link to the .doc version of the Confidential Report Form).
The Reporting Occupational Diseases and Injuries Form (again in .doc-type) states exactly the same.

The Public Health Fact Sheet Regarding Elemental Mercury Contamination at the Grafton Street School (MA) says that 


  [mercury] tests are available to measure elemental mercury levels in
  the body.
  Urine or blood samples are used to test for exposure to
  elemental mercury.  Urine is most useful for testing for potential
  inhalation exposure to elemental mercury.
  In order to get the most
  accurate measure of mercury, the sample should be collected soon after
  exposure.


Conclusion

Visit a GP of your choice and simply ask them to perform a mercury test on you. They will either collect blood or your urine and send it to a lab.     If they perform a urine test and you are very very sure that you only want organic mercury to be checked (where it is recommended to do a blood test), kindly tell them exactly this. 

I would strongly recommend printing out the linked PDF-Document and bringing that with you. It is easier for your doctor to accept the official document (and they will see that you are well-informed) than to trust in your reasoning.

But if you are one of those people who has to self-isolate, it means that you need to stay away from all situations where you could infect other people. This means any situation where you may come in close contact with others (face-to-face contact closer than one metre for more than 15 minutes or being in the same closed space for two hours).
You should avoid social gatherings, work, school, child care, university, sports gatherings, restaurants, and all other public gatherings.

330,expert,economics.stackexchange.com,"UK government promises to pay 80% of wages for people unemployed due to coronavirus. I am not economist, so I am probably missing something, but shouldn’t paying wages to unemployed due to coronavirus result in inflation due to decreased products and services created by economy? Is that just a mechanism to redistribute wealth?
","Not by itself. The inflation generally depends on the following monetary relation:

$$ MV =PY$$

Where M is money supply, V velocity of money (how much one buck is used in economy), P is the price level (change in which is inflation), and Y is a real output.

Now solving for P so we can focus on inflation gives us:

$$P=\frac{MV}{Y}$$

Hence price level (and consequently) increases when money supply increases, velocity of money increases or output decreases.

Now let’s analyze giving money to those unemployed.


Is it newly created money? If not then money supply won’t increase. If yes then it would increase inflation rate.
Redistribution generally does not affect velocity of money much so we can skip that.
Does this change the output Y? Well not by much those people are already unemployed. If anything it could increase Y as unemployed have probably high marginal propensity to consume so in short run redistribution from a richer person with lower marginal propensity to consume will increase Y. Especially if this spending was not paid out of higher taxes but from debt.


So a priori as long as it’s not financed through printing new money it should not really have effect on inflation. Inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon.

Also, yes it’s a redistribution mechanism like most of the things that UK government does. Any policy that uses government funds as a transfer to others, or fund non-public good services (like NHS for example) is a redistributive measure.
","It seems you are not confused about part (1) because that's exactly what it means.

Lexicographic preferences are monotone. Monotonicity means more is better. If I have more of every good in the bundle, then I like that bundle more. This is still true for lexicographic preferences, even though parts of the bundle may not matter. A condition for monotonicity is e.g. that (5,4) is preferred to (3,1). In other words if 5>3 and 4>1 then the first bundle is preferred. This is true for lexicographic preferences.

Your definitions of strict monotonicity and lexicographic preferences seem to deviate a bit from conventional definitions though. Here is a proof using your definitions.

Proof:

Let us compare two bundles with $n$ elements each: $x=(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ and $y=(y_1, y_2, ...,y_n)$

It is best to start with the if statement when going about proving such claims. The condition and therefore starting point is $x_1&gt;y_1$ and $x_2&gt;y_2$, .... , and $x_n&gt;y_n$.

In that case since  $x_1&gt;y_1$ we have according to your preference definition that bundle $x$ is preferred to bundle $y$. Furthermore we have that bundle $y$ is not preferred to bundle $x$. So bundle $x$ is strictly preferred.

Hence, we have shown that if $x_i$>$y_i$ for each $i$, then $x$ is preferred (because in that case $x_1 &gt; y_1$), which is your definition of monotonicity. The preferences are therefore monotonic.
","not by itself. the inflation generally depends on the following monetary relation:     mv  py    where m is money supply, v velocity of money  how much one buck is used in economy , p is the price level  change in which is inflation , and y is a real output.  now solving for p so we can focus on inflation gives us:    p  frac mv  y     hence price level  and consequently  increases when money supply increases, velocity of money increases or output decreases.  now let is analyze giving money to those unemployed.   is it newly created money  if not then money supply will not increase. if yes then it would increase inflation rate. redistribution generally does not affect velocity of money much so we can skip that. does this change the output y  well not by much those people are already unemployed. if anything it could increase y as unemployed have probably high marginal propensity to consume so in short run redistribution from a richer person with lower marginal propensity to consume will increase y. especially if this spending was not paid out of higher taxes but from debt.   so a priori as long as it is not financed through printing new money it should not really have effect on inflation. inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon.  also, yes it is a redistribution mechanism like most of the things that uk government does. any policy that uses government funds as a transfer to others, or fund non-public good services  like nhs for example  is a redistributive measure.

I have got a single entery Italian Schengen Visa valid early April for 2 weeks. But because of the coronavirus, Italy is under lockdown, which means that I am unable to make my trip as planned.

Now if I changed my planned destination and to visit Greece (by flight via Paris) instead, can I enter France with my already issued Italian Schengen Visa?

I can provide my new air ticket and hotel reservations, but I won't go to Italy at all. What other options I can choose if I need to make the trip on the same dates?
","EDIT: This is a fast evolving situation. Under the current circumstances I suggest anyone planning to come to Europe just cancel or postpone. 

A Schengen visa normally allows one to enter any Schengen country. 
There is no obligation to enter the Schengen area through the country that issued your visa. 
So entering via France (or any other country) is not an issue. 
It is pretty common even.

The rule that you must apply to the consulate of the country that is your main destination exists to spread the workload, and to counter visa shopping. 
To enforce that rule the immigration officer stamping you in may want to see hotel and flight reservations proving that indeed you plan to follow the itinerary on your Schengen Visa application. 
Arriving at the border with evidence suggesting that your plans are very different from those stated in your application will raise red flags, and may lead to a refusal.

This under normal circumstances. 
However we are no longer under normal circumstances. 
Deciding to no longer visit Italy is completely reasonable in light of the current situation. 
So I would guess that cutting Italy out of your plans is not going to raise a red flag. 
You should however inquire with the French consulate and the  French border police (dcpaf-em-cnic@interieur.gouv.fr).

One last thing: 
The way things are currently progressing all of Europe will be where Italy is now in about 10 days (and so might your home country). 
You might want to completely postpone your trip. 
","Ethiopia was formerly a fully state-controlled, Marxist economy and despite slow liberalization, many sectors remain government controlled.  This includes aviation, where Ethiopian Airlines has a de facto monopoly on domestic flights.  Hence fares are both high and fixed: it's a legacy of state control and there's no competition.

That said, it may apparently be possible to score cheaper flights via travel agencies in Ethiopia, so it may be worth exploring other options.  Bear in mind that Internet penetration in Ethiopia also remains low, so if your schedule is flexible, it might make sense to do this after arrival.

Incidentally, Ethiopia is not alone in this pricing scheme, I recall running into the same system in eg. Laos and a number of Central Asian countries as well.  Often there's a dual pricing system that charges top dollar for foreigners and has subsidized pricing for locals, but I'm not sure if this is the case for Ethiopia as well.  (Update: It appears this is indeed the case, with a 66% discount for residents &amp; people traveling to/from Ethiopia on Ethiopian Airlines.)

","Sure it's possible. First of all, the MSCI World Index consists of over 1,600 securities, so it's unlikely that either fund holds all of them in the same proportions as the index. They likely hold a representative sample that is intended to track the index closely. So the funds could have significantly different holdings and could perform differently (better or worse) than their benchmark (this is called ""tracking error"").

One thing to look at is their historical returns and risk to see if one has performed better than the other in the past. This does not guarantee that it will be better in the future, but it might indicate a better selection process (or could just be luck).

That said, you'd have to have a LOT of tracking error to make a significant difference between the two. More than likely the difference is negligible.

jammed health-care systems mean many Canadians may make it through the
pandemic without ever knowing if they had contracted the virus.

Canada does not have formal criteria for determining who should be tested,
meaning guidelines vary from province to province. Health-care workers are
generally advised to prioritize testing only those who are showing symptoms of
COVID-19, particularly if they are in hospitals, long-term care homes or other
institutional settings where they could easily spread the virus, as well as
symptomatic travellers entering Canada.

More than 240,000 tests for COVID-19 have been conducted in Canada as of March
31.

Anyone who is showing symptoms of COVID-19 and is concerned they may have
acquired the virus should contact their doctor or other primary health-care
provider.","While it’s still unclear if someone can contract the new coronavirus more than
once, it is possible to have more than one different virus at the same time.

Dr. Isaac Bogoch said it’s absolutely possible for someone to have COVID-19
and a strain of the flu or another virus simultaneously.

“We sound like broken records in the medical and scientific community, but for
the last two months we’ve been saying ‘We’ve got to prepare for this. We’ve
got to prepare for this. Optimize your health,’” he told CTV’s Your Morning on
March 20.

Bogoch said people should “optimize” their health by getting vaccinated for
everything that they are eligible to be vaccinated for, such as influenza or
bacterial pneumonias.

“It’s totally possible to have what’s called a co-infection and we know people

494,general,politics.stackexchange.com,"The ""Daily"" NY Times podcast for 3/12/20 described two effective management schemes for handling the epidemic.  Briefly:

Chinese: Check everyone's temperature frequently on a massive scale.  Track individuals with QR codes.  Use a flow chart procedure to confirm or eliminate a COVID hypothesis, and put affected individuals in government quarantine as needed, separating confirmed cases within a family so as to minimize contagion within families.

The flow chart procedure was describe as follows: screen for body temperature and cough. Eliminate bacterial infection and allergy as possible. Cat scan for pneumonia.

Also an NPR report described an online support group led by a social worker that included quarantine graduates who gave descriptions of quarantine living conditions, including food, and gave advice about what to take along to quarantine.  These services apparently helped people cope positively with fears of quarantine.

South Korean: Extensive testing and thorough, meticulous exposure tracing.

My question is, would it be possible to implement one or both of these in the United States (or Europe)?
","""From the helicopter"" there is now a more general claim (e.g. in the following McKinsey slide) that Western countries are trying to emulate China and/or South Korea's response:



The devil might be in the details, of course. Getting to the details might be too involved/broad in a question like this, not specific to a pair of countries. There's for example a China-US comparison in a recent BI article, too long to quote here in its entirety, of course. But some things that were probably not done in the West was a complete shutdown of travel, e.g.


  ""These draconian measures seem to have worked to bring down the cases in a very short period of time in China,"" Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Business Insider. ""Although there is a cost to the economy, to society, not to mention also the second-order problems, like access to health care for people without the coronavirus. The question is whether the United States is willing to pay such a high price."" [...] Huang says he cannot imagine an America where many of these measures are implemented. [...]
  
  During the height of the outbreak, trains didn't stop at the disease's epicenter, Wuhan. [...] ""Cutting off transportation was considered on the top three measures to contain the spread of the virus,"" Huang told Business Insider. ""But it would hard to imagine the complete shutdown of an American city due to government order.""


And regarding tracking of people's movement


  ""It would be a big change right for the US people to get accustomed to,"" said Huang, ""if the government wants to use this high tech means, like using the cell phones to monitor the movement of the people.""
  
  Huang added that even though there is little technological barrier to doing this, this kind of behavior is considered a form of digital authoritarianism, that involves uses privacy issues. Huang would be hard-pressed to imagine the US government using this approach to containing the spread of the coronavirus.


China also apparently co-opted every (""private"") security guard in the effort to keep people in their homes:


  ""In America, you have to stay at home, but there's no police,"" said Huang. ""There's no one actively enforcing that rule, but in China, you have what are basically security guards on patrol of every residence to make sure they don't violate the government containment measures. That's a kind of approach I think can't be copied here in the United States.""


Likewise for suspending ""non-essential"" medical access:


  In China, elective surgeries and other non-critical doctors visits were delayed, and many medical services were moved online. [...]  But the move hasn't been without negative consequences. One man with kidney disease in China jumped to his death, Human Rights Watch reported. He couldn't get dialysis during the outbreak. Another boy with cerebral palsy died after being left alone for six days while his father was quarantined in China. 


A similar opinion was voiced in a Time interview:


  “No other nation (western or otherwise) can or should seek to replicate China’s actions,” Thomas Bollyky, the director of the Global Health Program at the Washington D.C.-based Council on Foreign Relations, tells TIME via email. “The disregard for civil liberties and human rights that the government has demonstrated in its quarantine and censorship activities are inseparable from the policies and actions of the government that contributed to the outbreak in the first place.”


Other experts quoted earlier in a Science (news) piece were also skeptical that the full extent of China's measures could be copied in the West:


  The question now is whether the world can take lessons from China’s apparent success—and whether the massive lockdowns and electronic surveillance measures imposed by an authoritarian government would work in other countries. [...]
  
  “This report poses difficult questions for all countries currently considering their response to COVID-19,” says Steven Riley, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London. “The joint mission was highly productive and gave a unique insight into China’s efforts to stem the virus from spread within mainland China and globally,” adds Lawrence Gostin, a global health law scholar at Georgetown University. But Gostin warns against applying the model elsewhere. “I think there are very good reasons for countries to hesitate using these kinds of extreme measures.”
  
  There’s also uncertainty about what the virus, dubbed SARS-CoV-2, will do in China after the country inevitably lifts some of its strictest control measures and restarts its economy. COVID-19 cases may well increase again.


More recent cases from Hong Kong indicate that that fear of re-emergence may well be have been justified. So Hong Kong is back into lock down after it was largely lifted at the beginning of March.

Similar expert opinion on restrictions timing:


  Epidemiologists say China’s mammoth response had one glaring flaw: it started too late. In the initial weeks of the outbreak in December and January, Wuhan authorities were slow to report cases of the mysterious infection, which delayed measures to contain it, says Howard Markel, a public-health researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “The delay of China to act is probably responsible for this world event,” says Markel.
  
  A model simulation by Lai Shengjie and Andrew Tatem, emerging-disease researchers at the University of Southampton, UK, shows that if China had implemented its control measures a week earlier, it could have prevented 67% of all cases there. Implementing the measures 3 weeks earlier, from the beginning of January, would have cut the number of infections to 5% of the total. [...]
  
  But between 16 and 30 January, a period that included the first 7 days of the lockdown, the number of people each infected individual gave the virus to dropped to 1.05, estimates Adam Kucharski, who models infectious-disease spread at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “That was amazing,” he says. [...]
  
  “These extreme limitations on population movement have been quite successful,” says Michael Osterholm, an infectious-disease scientist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. [... However,] China is suppressing the virus, not eradicating it, says Osterholm. The world will need to wait until about eight weeks after China resumes to some form of normality to know what it did or didn’t accomplish with its population-movement limitations, he says.
  
  There is probably a fierce debate going on in China about when to relax the lockdown measures, says Roy Anderson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London. He suggests there could be a second wave of new infections when they are lifted.


So whether it's possible to (fully) emulate China's response (in the West) depends not only on the political framework, but also to which experts the (Western) governments might be paying [most] attention to.

I realize this is a long answer already, but there was a recent interview with one of China's [own] CDC officials (whom seldom get interviewed in the West). Some interesting points from there:


  Q: What mistakes are other countries making?
  
  A: The big mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my opinion, is that people aren’t wearing masks. [...]
  
  Q: People who tested positive in Wuhan but only had mild disease were sent into isolation in large facilities and were not allowed to have visits from family. Is this something other countries should consider?
  
  A: Infected people must be isolated. [...]
  
  Q: Spread in China has dwindled to a crawl, and the new confirmed cases are mainly people entering the country, correct?
  
  A: Yes. At the moment, we don’t have any local transmission, but the problem for China now is the imported cases. So many infected travelers are coming into China.




More recently (April 2) it has been reported by DW that Germany is considering a voluntary phone app similar to the (mandatory?) one[s] used in China:


  The most famous health app was developed by the tech giant Alibaba in conjunction with the Chinese authorities. Other companies have also developed similar software, however. It was possible to work swiftly because the Chinese state already has access regarding citizens' movements and programmers did not have to worry about data protection laws. [...]
  
  There are many who hope that Germany will soon be using such an app. The Health Ministry and researchers at the Robert Koch Institute are developing similar software. The idea is to introduce a non-compulsory app that will not be able to detect who met whom and where but will be able to identify if a phone user was in close contact with another infected user.
  
  The app will only really be able to function if 60 percent of the population uses it. In Germany, it won't be as easy as in Asia to reach such a percentage.
  
  Will Germans cooperate?
  
  Half of the respondents to a recent poll said they would not oppose an app to help warn users who had come into contact with someone infected with COVID-19. 


They don't link to the poll, but I guess in was a poll in Germany given that this was an article on DW.

There's now a BBC video discussing Chinese-inspired surveillance measures to combat the outbreak. This is of course somewhat subjective, but they only short-listed Singapore, Israel, Iran, Taiwan and Russia as being closest to China-style surveillance measures used to combat the epidemic, like using CCTV cameras and phone tracking.
","No,

Article I Section 3 of the United States Constitution mandates the seats of the three class of Senators to be vacated at the expiration of the 2nd, 4th and 6th years respectively. Elections are to be held to choose one third of the Senators “every second year“.


  The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year, of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year, and the third class at the expiration of the sixth year, so that one third may be chosen every second year;


So, unless there are vacancies in the Senate (see special election procedure outlined in the 17th Amendment), elections for the three different classes of Senators are mandated by the Constitution to be held every two years.

Not at all! It is never selfish to ask, though it might be selfish to insist, and it might likewise be selfish if you did not make it clear that you understand your advisor has the final say in this.

It is an odd feeling asking your advisor to pay for things for you, isn't it? Many students are afraid of coming across as entitled, but the better approach is to be matter-of-fact and professional about it. Simply explain (in a short message to your advisor)


The item(s) you want to get;
In a nutshell (1 sentence), why this item would help you be more productive and comfortable working at home;
The specific estimate on price or price range.


Don't phrase it as a demand; just state what you are thinking of, and then ask: ""Would it be possible to reimburse this item?""


  My advisor proposed to get us some items to make us more productive or happy when working at home.


Based on your this, I agree with the top answer that it is overwhelmingly likely your advisor will be fine with getting you these items. But articulating (1), (2), and (3) above will help make this more concrete, and phrasing it as a question makes it easy for your advisor to say no if they think that one of the items is excessive.
","Everyone works at their own pace; moreover, the pace can fluctuate a lot depending on the time of year, your personal life, and ""position of stars in the sky"". Even though the semester seems like a decent amount of time to average out those fluctuations, I don't think it is.

I would try to use the following criteria to estimate the term success:


feedback from your advisor
how did the term go compared to the original plan (yep, here I assume that you make the plans for your term/month/week and correct them accordingly. Hopefully, some milestones are discussed with the advisor as well)
feedback from your committee (in some universities, Ph.D. students meet with their committee regularly or send them the progress report to hear their feedback)


I would certainly not recommend comparing your progress with other students because they are different, they have different goals, and you don't have complete information about their progress either. It is very easy to get discouraged for no reason.

To sum it up, I would stress the importance of initial planning and correcting the plans throughout the term. Then, you will have a very good measure of your success. You will end up with a different question of ""how to plan"", but that is a totally different problem.

327,expert,economics.stackexchange.com,"Not an economist by far, just a layman, and that's a layman question.

How is this possible that it's difficult to find mask for the Corona Virus? I have been several times to 7/11, boots, Watson, and other pharmacies, and everytime they did not have it as they ran out. How is it possible that the producers of masks give up on additional earning by not producing more masks, now that it's pretty obvious the demand is going up?

The fact that there are not enough masks is my personal experience in Bangkok - however, some friends of mine have the same experience in Italy, where the Corona Virus outbreak has reached a scary stage.

Generally. I would explain capitalism failure by pointing at government regulations - however in this case I don't see how the government can be involved into mask production. 
Any idea? 
","This is a common problem in many domains. For example, there's massive new demand of Airbus planes after the Boeing 737 Max 8 disaster, and their manufacturing capacity is maxed out.

I'm familiar with it from the domain of software development, so I'll use that as an example.

Suppose some website gets mentioned on Reddit and the post happens to hit the first page. It gets the ""Reddit hug of death"" (the swarm of reddit users overwhelm the website's servers, and it becomes unavailable). You could ask the same question:


  How is it possible that the producers of [this site] give up on additional earning by not [spinning up more servers], now that it's pretty obvious the demand is going up?


If that ""additional earning"" (of having more of your product available to provide) is less than it costs to permanently over-provision a resource (web servers, mask production factories, etc.), then it's not economical to do so.

Cloud infrastructure is becoming incredibly liquid, because resources are very flexible and can be pooled. A high traffic day for my website might be a low traffic day for yours. A cloud provider could scale down your site (saving you money) by uninstalling your software from a server, reassigning that server to me, and use it to scale up my site by installing my software on it (raising my infrastructure costs, but also raising my business' income because it hasn't gone down). There are even auto-scaling systems that can scale your service up and down in response to current load. There's still some lead time, on the order of a few minutes for web server virtual machines.

The real world is much less flexible than software. If masks are in hot demand, but construction helmets aren't, you can't re-purpose the injection molds for hard hats into face-mask stitching machines. There are many factors involved in deciding whether or not its worth in investing to grow the mask manufacturing business:


How many masks are available in reserve? In the warehouses of factories and distributors, in hospitals, in military bases, etc.
How long do we think this epidemic will last? Will it last long enough to deplete the reserves? Is it long-term enough to justify the high up front expenses?
How much marginal profit is there to be made in selling these extra masks?


Interestingly, this problem repeats itself and plays itself out upstream in the supply chain. Are the companies that make mask-stitching machines able to produce enough for the new demand? What about their upstream supply chain?
","Yes.

Example. In 2017, a country's GDP was \$100 and its population was 100.

In 2018, its GDP was \$110, its population was 105, and the price level rose by 3%. Then:


2017 GDP per capita was $\$100 \div \ 100 = \$1$.
2017 Real GDP per capita (in 2017 prices) was also $\$1.$
2018 GDP per capita was $\$110 \div \ 105 \approx \$1.048$.
2018 Real GDP per capita (in 2017 prices) was $\$1.048 \div 1.03 \approx \$1.017$.

439,general,politics.stackexchange.com,"Japan is currently the nation with the highest debt as a percentage of GDP - at the time of writing it stands at over 250%. Greece, currently the second most indebted nation, went through a decade-long debt crisis after the 2008 financial crash. It entered this crisis with debt levels of 'only' 103% of GDP, and over the entire debt crisis, this only increased to 181% of GDP.

How is Japan able to withstand this level of debt without entering a debt crisis similar to Greece? Is this the right metric to look at, or are there other factors specific to either country?
","Their economies are radically different otherwise.


Greece has a weak economy in most fields, with the exception of tourism.  Japan is a manufacturing and scientific powerhouse.
Greece runs recurring high deficits and had rarely, if ever, shown inclination to stop doing so.  While Japan was criticized at the start of their financial decline for insisting on balanced budgets instead of stimulating demand.
Tax collection.  Japan does it.  Greece didn't.
Japan could devaluate its currency if necessary to adjust its finances.  Greece couldn't, being on the euro.
Japanese government debt is, I believe, mostly owed to Japanese investors and denominated in yen, unlike Greece's.
Japan has demonstrated for decades that it can pay its bills, on its own.  Greece on the other hand just seemed as if the only thing that kept it up was euro membership.
Greek official statistics were not, and had not for a while, been trusted.  They're still prosecuting the guy who showed they were cooking the books.


Until 2008, Greece was only getting charged a 0.25% point premium over German bonds based on the tacit assumption that Europe (Euro-zone) would never let Greece go broke. Investors, out of greed and risk un-awareness (or trust in European taxpayers gullibility), parked their money in Greek bonds, rather than German ones, just to get that extra 0.25% point.

From https://www.bankofgreece.gr/Publications/Annrep1999.pdf (I find it hard to set hard time limits on Google to only look at stuff from before a date):


  Specifically, the yield differential between the Greek and the German 10-year
  bond fell from roughly 270 basis points at end-1998 to about 200 basis points in March
  1999 (see Chart VI.1).


At the start of the general crisis, investors started wondering if trusting that Europe would always back Greek debt, even when undergoing a Europe-wide crisis, was a wise idea.  Once perception soured, the game was up very quickly.  Financing costs for Greek government debt went up, fast.  Any refinancing happened at progressively higher rates.  A debt that looked bad at the previous, lower, rate seemed like it would result in a short term default.  People still loaned to Greece, but the premium to do so was massive and made this very quickly unsustainable.

The plug was pulled, late high-rate private and non-European investors got a haircut.  Europe's taxpayers paid up enough money for Greece to keep paying slightly lowered interests, at deferred times, to the big German and French banks so they wouldn't take too massive a loss (and so that loss of confidence wouldn't spread, as per @Machavity answer).

Most Greek debt remained in place, unlike what happens in say an Argentinian default.  In fact, money ""helpfully"" loaned to keep Greece from defaulting on interest payments just got added to the overall debt.  In a way, though it fully deserved the initial mess it got, that's the tragedy of Greece.  Instead of the reset that comes with a default, Greeks got this unending misery of servicing a debt which is only pretended to be fully recoverable from (as most of my post is critical, I want to stress that, IMHO, the Greek people don't deserve to live through this for decades).

But no one is too willing to put their hands in that wolf's jaws anymore.

As o.m. says, mostly perception. Until COVID-19 at least, Japan looks like it has a few good years left for investors, most of whom are Japanese and have little interest in rocking the boat.  This is not to say it is financially healthy, only that it is under less external pressure.

Greece relies on foreign money, didn't look good in 2008 and doesn't now.  In most other conditions, big chunks of that 181% would have been written off as unrecoverable already.
","Previous presidents have been obliged to put their investments into blind or at least arms-length trusts. The legal discussion around this centers on the ""foreign emoulements clause"":


  No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State


and constitutional rules on Presidential compensation:


  The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them


The paper notes that there are active lawsuits on this question. So it seems that the legal position is ""pending decision by the courts"", and the political question at the moment seems to be ""yes"", in that the President's party are unwilling to criticize or take action against it.

  What factors should be considered? 



How much do you have in an ""emergency fund""? If you have enough cash on hand to handle most true emergencies (maybe a few thousand dollars in case your A/C goes out or your car loses its transmission), then put everything else towards the debt. If you have a huge emergency fund but are paying interest on debt, then that money is costing you in interest payments.
Why do you have debt in the first place? If you use this one-time income to pay down credit card debt but don't solve the underlying spending problem, then you'll just be back where you started at some point. Make sure you spend less than you make (ideally by not using credit cards at all) and get a grip on your budget, or your efforts will be in vain.


Remember that you ""earn"" money by paying off debt equal to the interest rate that you pay off.  For example, if the annual interest rate on your debt is 10% and you pay $1,000 to it, you ""earn"" a roughly 10% annual return on that $1,000 by saving you $100 in interest over a year (plus a small amount due to compounding).

How much help do you have for these 80 students?

I do have one PhD student who is a grader.
She is supposed to spend about 6 hours a week to help with the course.

","I also teach a data and programming course, though I mainly use Python.

Is it possible for you to shift grading away from an exam and toward something else?  A project, for example?  Before going back to academia I spent years working as a policy researcher, and exam conditions simply aren't a realistic test of real-life coding abilities.  For that matter, coding with the internet turned off is also not remotely what real work looks like either.

In my class I like to give a larger project and let them have a few weeks to work on it, but I could also imagine a more simple project that they only have a few days, or even hours, to do.  Real data work often comes with time constraints, but it does not come with a lack of internet access in exam-like conditions.  Just scale the scope of the project based on how long you want them to have to work on it.

There is still a huge advantage to knowing the material, rather than having to look it up.  You can also grade on the quality of code and correctness of results, and allow for creativity with open-ended questions like ""summarize this data with two plots"".  This way each student is not only tested their knowledge of R, they're tested on their actual ability to use R in a realistic environment.

If you, unfortunately, are required to give an exam, I know there is software available for proctoring online tests.  The sort of thing that utilizes their webcams to make sure they don't leave during the test, or consult other devices, or open other web pages.  I've not used them though, so I couldn't make a recommendation.  I imagine they all require university subscriptions.
","One thing not mentioned yet is that publisher policies typically have a line forbidding multiple submission. For example, Springer's publishing ethics page requires that ""The manuscript has not been submitted to more than one journal for simultaneous consideration"", whie Wiley's research integrity page says ""The Copyright Transfer Agreement, Exclusive License Agreement or the Open Access Agreement, one of which must be submitted before publication in any Wiley journal, requires signature from the corresponding author to warrant that the article [...] is not being considered for publication elsewhere in its final form.""

If you dual submit, you are violating the publisher's policies. If you are detected, there's a chance you'll be blacklisted by the publisher (not just the journal), which will close all the publisher's journals to you.

608,general,travel.stackexchange.com,"In the current situation, many people will have to cancel existing flight or hotel bookings, and would like to get a refund.

In which cases can one get a refund?
","There are many specific rules which will vary based on at least:


the country where the property or airline is based
the point of departure or the destination of the flight
the country where you reside
the original cancellation terms of the booking
whether you bought flights and hotels separately or not
who you bought the flights and/or hotel from
whether they were bought as part of group bookings / blocks
other specific details.


But, in general, the following apply:


If your flight is cancelled by the airline, then you should in general be eligible for a refund.


For flights covered by the EU Flight Compensation Regulation EC261/2004, i.e. all flights departing from an EU/EEA member state or operated by an airline based in an EU/EEA member state, this is explicitly stated in Article 8 of the regulation.

Given that there are exceptional circumstances, no compensation is due. However, you must still be given the option of a refund, though one can accept rerouting or rebooking.

As airlines are cash-strapped, they will try to convince you to take a voucher instead of a refund. You can agree to it if you want, but they cannot force you to do so. Remember that many airlines will fail due to this situation. A failed airline cannot honour a voucher or a rebooking (though it's quite probable quite a few will fail before owed refunds are paid).

Airlines are required to refund you within 7 days. Given the very large number of queries they are receiving at this time, and the precarious financial situation they are in, it will probably take much longer, though, and in many cases any appeal will take enough time for the airline to have failed before you get paid.
For other cancelled flights not covered by EC261, the rule should be the same (they couldn't provide the service, so they should provide a refund), but this will be governed by local laws and/or the airlines terms &amp; conditions (conditions of carriage).
Note that several other countries implement rules very similar (or even identical) to EC261, including Turkey, Georgia, Moldova, Serbia and Ukraine.
Note that you should only ask for the refund if you are at home. If you are stranded in a foreign country, getting a refund may complicate things a lot to secure alternate travel. Though EC261 requires the airline to provide both the refund and a return flight ""at the earliest opportunity"", in many cases the return flight you want may not be operated by the airline but via some other scheme.

If however your flight has not (yet) been cancelled, and you decide to change your plans, then you do not have the right to a full refund (unless the fare was fully refundable, of course). In theory, the original terms of your fare should apply (including fares being non-refundable, penalties, etc.). Most airlines will however offer to either rebook for free or provide a voucher valid for future travel (usually valid for a year). Note that in many cases, the rebooking options or voucher validity will be limited to one year from the original purchase date. I doubt any will offer a refund in this case.

This applies also if you change your plans because the situation at the destination is no longer suitable, or you will not be able to get to your hotel, or the conference or event you were planning to attend has been cancelled, or you are stuck in yet another country due to the current travel restrictions, etc. As long as it's not the airline cancelling the flight, no refunds are due.
The case of countries suddenly closing their borders to some categories of people (e.g. the US refusing entry to anyone having gone through the Schengen Area, UK, or Ireland in the past 14 days) probably falls in the last category: as long as the flight still operates, the airline usually is not required to provide a refund.
Airlines will often proactively suggest you rebook your travel or get a voucher. Once you have accepted that option, you are no longer eligible for a refund even if the flight you originally booked ends up being cancelled.
For hotels, the rules are basically the same, though I'm not aware of any blanket legislation like EC261:


If the hotel cancels the booking (because they will be closed or completely inaccessible), you should in general be eligible for a refund, even if the fare was non-refundable.
If the hotel is still able to honour your booking, but you just can't get there (because there are no flights, borders are closed, you're stuck in another country, region or city) or no longer want to get there (you no longer want to travel, the event you wanted to attend has been cancelled...), then you are in general not eligible for a refund.

Here again, the hotel may apply the original rules of the booking (no refunds or changes at all), or they can (and many will) allow for a rebooking at a later date or a voucher. But ultimately, that is their choice.

Travel booked as a ""package"" (flight + hotel, sometimes other components as well) sold by a travel agent or tour operator usually have additional protections, especially those sold by EU companies. Most importantly, if the flight is cancelled or the hotel at the destination is unreachable/closed, one is eligible for a refund of the whole package, whereas when both are booked separately, one may be able to get a refund for one but not the other.
Added 18/3/2020 In some places, the government has changed the rules, and explicitly authorises some actors to not refund, and instead only provide a voucher valid for one year. See this answer for Belgium for such an exemple.


Let's add that this is were travel insurance should come into play, but double-check any exclusions and conditions that may apply. Also, don't forget that you may have multiple travel insurances: many credit cards have a travel insurance automatically included for all travel bought using the card. Check the conditions and exclusions of any that may apply (you can of course only get refunded by a single one).
","As usual, it depends. I haven't been to all Philippines (only to 14 or so cities), so take this with a grain of salt.

Every public toilet I used there was reasonably clean. Most weren't exactly as shown on your link, and some (for example on a local market in Cebu) didn't have running water (there's a bucket of water nearby and you flush with a ladle), but it didn't look or felt filthy. From my experience it's similar to Thailand, and way above a typical toilet in India.

What was common, however, was the lack of toilet paper. Even paid toilets sometime (not always) had only tissues, and usually for extra fee - although minor.

And as you guess, pay toilets and those closer to touristy areas are generally cleaner and more stocked.

I wonder why these tests are so different and can't find proper information on what which country is testing for. 
","First of all the disclaimer: I'm analytical chemist but not clinical chemist. That is, I professionally do things that are related/to some extent similar to test kit development, but not for medical use, and I've only been very remotely involved with microbiology-related testing. OTOH, I expect that pretty much everyone who works in this field is likely to work a lot these days and not to have any time to hang out on SX.

So this is all AFAIK, and I'm happy be corrected - and OP please take this with the appropriate caution against stuff written in the internet by random strangers.


The tests are developed in much haste, and undergo some emergency validation rather than the full validation procedure that is usually required. This naturally leads to some uncertainty about their performance, but we accept that in order to have tests available at all right now.
See e.g. what the FDA says about Covid tests  
List with FDA Emergency Use Approved Covid tests. 
Different tests search for different parts of the virus RNA.
(This is getting very far from my field, but is this the information you're looking for as what exctly is tested [by the CDC-developed test]?)
Viruses mutate, so a test that works well at some place at one time may not work as well somewhere else or a few weeks or months later. 
For a test to work, 


sampling 
possibly transport
extraction from the sample (difficulty varies e.g. between mouth swabs and sputum)
the test kit  


must all work well. E.g. if the sampling is not done properly because there's no properly trained staff available, nothing can be done further down the analytic process. I don't know why the Indonesian tests don't work, but it may be as ""simple"" as samples undergoing long transportation to a lab with the appropriate equipment so they spoil on the way.
The faulty tests in the US seem to have had a wrong reagent - and burocratic approval was needed for the labs to replace that by their own good reagents.
(Usually, if a lab wants to use other than the prescribed/delivered reagent, they need to a lengthy validation of the procedure - the point here is to be allowed to avoid that as it would take too long)

","Schnirman, et al. (2017) talks of such a risk.


  The mask, which touches the patient’s face, should be cleaned daily with distilled water. Rinsing the face mask or tubing with tap water, instead of using distilled water, or adding tap water in the humidifier is a potential source of legionella colonization.


Sterile distilled water cannot sustain legionella growth (Joly, et al. 1986). Therefore I would not hold much credibility to the idea that you don't need to throw the remaining water out in the morning. Fresh water is to be used each night. Adding tap water in the humidifier is a potential source of legionella colonization (Schnirman, et al. 2017)


  Most recommend that the tubing and humidifier be cleaned at least weekly. Some suppliers also recommend cleaning the mask and tubing with vinegar and water daily. In addition, masks and tubing are designed to be disposable; they should not be used more than their recommended periods, which is generally 3–6 months for CPAP masks. (Schnirman, et al. 2017)

217,expert,law.stackexchange.com,"I live in a fairly desirable area with one drawback: my apartment overlooks a multi-lane restricted access parkway. I'd prefer not to say more for privacy reasons. Until recently, it's been only a minor annoyance.

But since things have been locked down due to the coronavirus outbreak, I've been spending a lot more time at home, and the traffic on the parkway has gotten lighter, meaning that at least anecdotally speeds have increased. The result is a huge increase in infrasound. It's like my whole apartment is shaking all day.

I'm obviously not expecting the state to shut down traffic on the road completely for my comfort. It does seem like a reasonable expectation that the people driving on a roadway should get at least close to the legal speed limit, however. The posted speed on the road is 30 miles per hour, while drivers routinely flout this going 60 or 70 miles per hour.

I've already tried writing to my city government, who referred me to a state agency who hasn't written back. I've also contacted the person who represents me in my state legislature. His office too has not written back to me.

What's the most effective way to get my argument to a decision maker? Would I be better served addressing this complaint to the police department with jurisdiction over the roadway? Would I be better served organizing my neighbors and then returning to my state legislator with more of a coalition?

(I live in Boston, Massachusetts.)
","I see that this question has been migrated from Politics.SE, but I'd argue that's the better forum for this question. We're talking about finding a way to enforce the law, but the options available to you are pretty solidly in the political category.

What you're doing is probably the best way to go. The state government is unlikely to do much, so stay on top of your local government.

Communicate directly with the police, as many departments will make a point of setting up patrols in areas where they get complaints. 

On top of that, get as many people as you can to support your cause. The more noise they make, the harder it is for the government to ignore the problem. Circulate petitions, make calls, etc.

At the same time, keep in mind that this problem is a side effect of an emergency situation that is causing all sorts of problems that make yours look trivial by comparison. Do not be surprised if emergency personnel conclude that this is too low priority to address, even if it is remarkably inconvenient to you personally.
","I don't know of a jurisdiction in which a person could confess to a different crime as an alibi with any sort of guarantee of non-prosecution. 

However, that might not be the ""only alternative"". The prosecution must, after all, prove its case. Knowing that the defendant was not actually there, any witnesses saying otherwise are known to be mistaken or lying, and the defense can attack them accordingly.  Evidence which suggests the accused's involvement can be investigated and challenged. If someone saw the accused near the scene of the other crime (but not committing it) that might be an effective alibi.

625,general,travel.stackexchange.com,"In 2019 I booked a flight ticket with SAS to Svalbard. Unfortunately Covid19 happened.

My ticket is from a flight outside the nordic countries, with a layover in Oslo.

I'll be prevented from entering Norway, since I'm not a resident. Moreover, even if I was already in Norway right now, I'd be prevented from boarding the flight from Oslo to Longyearbyen, since Svalbard  also separately restricted travel.

To add to the complexity, when I tried to book this ticket, SAS doesn't offer a flight with a single layover. All of the flights I found have a further layover in Stavanger, Stockholm, Copenhagen... even if SAS offers direct flights to Oslo! The solution I found was to book with a travel agent which sold me a ticket with a single layover.

So, SAS has a page for Covid19 information, with links to a search tool (a bit buggy and annoying to use) to check cancelled and confirmed flights, I haven't been able to confirm it for sure, but the closer we are to the departure date (it's less than 10 days from now), it seems that the less likely it'll be for it to be cancelled.

I have the option of REBOOKING FREE OF CHARGE, unfortunately The rebooking can be made only once. and due to the current uncertainty, it's really difficult to pick another sensible date on which to plan my trip (no idea when Norway and Svalbard will reopen to visitors).

In theory, I have the option to exchange my flight ticket for a voucher, that way I'd have the option to defer choosing the new date, which would suit me much better. Unfortunately The voucher is valid for bookings made directly with SAS (not for bookings made by travel agents).

I already contacted my travel agent 6 days ago. They ask not to call, and contact them via their ticketing system only for trips in the next 4 weeks. Unfortunately, both messages I sent them have been replied with an automated reply which suggests to call them on the phone (phone which only has a recorded message, saying that they are unable to take calls due to the huge volume of requests).

So, it seems that I'm stuck. I was thinking that given that in normal circumstances I have right to travel to norway (being an EEA citizen), if I'm denied boarding I should be able to at least hope for compensation according to EU regulation 261.  Though it seems there's an exception  For safety, security or health reasons, which usually is for different kinds of concerns, but it might be applied to a blanket ban on non-residents due to Covid19.
Regardless if that exception happens, I'd have to actually attempt boarding (be at the airport on time) to actually claim compensation. I could do that, but that seems less than ideal:


I'm social distancing, and I'd rather avoid a needless trip to the airport
As described above, I don't know if I should realistically expect compensation (maybe you can help me here)
I'd have to hope that the airline would really not let me board (given that I'd then be stuck in Norway without a flight to come back immediately), though I guess I can go past the gate and then turn back before entering the plane.


I guess that if the worst thing that happens to me during this pandemic is that I'll lose out on the money for this flight ticket, that's still pretty good, all things considered. Before giving up on it though, maybe you have some suggestion on how to able to be refunded?
","If someone has an answer to the general question, that's still welcome, but to provide an update on my specific situation:

It seems that things will resolve for the best: the airline ended up cancelling the flight, and the travel agent wrote me that they'll go ahead with the refund process.

I've actually only received automated emails from the agent, and I've been unable to speak with anyone. Otoh I've actually been able to speak with someone from the airline, so this experience is persuading me to try even harder in the future to avoid booking via a travel agent.
","There is a possibility you will have to pay, as I am reading on TripAdvisor they are very strict on bags:


  Etihad is extremely strict at check in on carry on baggage size, it's weight, and also the weight of checked baggage, so much so that at Abu Dhabi there are scales and areas for passengers to re-distribute contents across bags to balance weight variations.


Also, from this question:


  Airlines do weigh checked baggage and that is the most important measurement, actual dimensions are almost never measured for 'normal' luggage. Even when they do, small differences are hardly ever a problem, especially if the overall dimensions are good.
  There is, however, no guaranty a specific agent may measure and give you a harder time.
  At this time there is no tradition of measuring luggage out of sight of the passenger and coming back to them with complains.
  
  If the rules change in the future, you might be stuck with a piece of luggage that can not be used on flights.

 So it’s critical to play it safe and not infect yourself and, in turn, others. The CDC suggests: 
 
 Giving the sick person their own room to stay in, if possible. Keep the door closed.
 Having only one person serve as the caretaker.
 Asking the sick person to wear a face mask, if they are able to. If the mask causes breathing difficulties, then the caretaker should wear a mask instead.","The novel coronavirus is dangerous for several reasons, even if the number of deaths haven’t matched that of the flu.
 The first US case of coronavirus was reported in January, and the first US death from coronavirus was reported in late February. By April 9, the US had more than 456,800 cases of coronavirus, and more than 16,000 people have died.
 Since this flu season started October 1, more than 24,000 Americans have died from the flu, according to CDC estimates. Nationwide, the flu has infected at least 39 million people between October and late March. 
 But here are key differences when comparing the flu vs. coronavirus: 
 
 The CDC estimates for the flu go back to October 2019. But the first US case of coronavirus didn’t emerge until several months later.
 Coronavirus is twice as contagious as the flu. Research indicates a person with the flu infects an average of 1.28 other people, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. But with coronavirus, “it’s likely between 2 and 3” other people.
 Coronavirus infections have a “very high mortality rate – one in six – among people who are over 80 and people with underlying chronic disease,” epidemiologist Dr. Abdul El-Sayed said. 
 People with coronavirus might not get symptoms for 14 days, and some get no symptoms at all. But during that time, they’re still contagious and can infect others unknowingly. 
 A vaccine is available for the flu, but no vaccine is available for coronavirus. Experts say the number of flu deaths could be drastically reduced if more people got their flu shots. But about half of Americans don’t get vaccinated, including most children who die from the flu.","with the shortage of coronavirus testing nationwide, it may be difficult to know whether your loved one has coronavirus or another illness.  so it is critical to play it safe and not infect yourself and, in turn, others. the cdc suggests:     giving the sick person their own room to stay in, if possible. keep the door closed.  having only one person serve as the caretaker.  asking the sick person to wear a face mask, if they are able to. if the mask causes breathing difficulties, then the caretaker should wear a mask instead.",67
379,general,money.stackexchange.com,"I am in the process of making an offer for a house. Wife and I have about 135K saved, with steady jobs, both happen to be an 'essential business' as required for this period during the corona virus.

Initially, I wanted to put 20% down (about 74K) to avoid PMI and have lower monthly payments.

I have since reversed course on this. I think 10% (about 37K) is better, and here is my reasoning. PMI calculators online suggest the PMI will be about 150 a month. 37K invested returns should be more than double the yearly PMI payments during an average year. We plan on being in this house for the foreseeable future, so I am playing the long game with this chunk of investment. We can also have the option to make a chunk payment in the future to bring it to 20% equity and get the PMI taken off if we choose. Also, this gives us access to this cash in a more liquid form during these unsure times.

Does this reasoning make sense? With a long term outlook, would it still be wise to sink the extra 37K into the house and get rid of the PMI?
","Short answer: 
It probably makes sense to avoid the PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance), but it ultimately depends on how probable it is that you are unable to pay the monthly installments with/without the extra savings. 

Long answer:
While i am not an expert on the specifics of the US mortgage market (I presume the question pertains to US), it seems that a PMI (or an increment of the overall interest rate charged on the loan) varies between 0.5% and 2% p.a. and is charged on the overall loan amount (90% in this case). Your loan amount works out to 333k from the provided information and your annual PMI payment to 1800. This puts it on the lower end with 0.54%. 

That means that with the 37k you plan to invest instead of paying down, you have to earn 4.9% p.a. plus the normal mortgage interest rate on those 37k - all this net of tax (assuming you get no tax deduction on your mortgage/PMI payments). This seems like a tall order compared to a ""risk-free"" savings you realize by having a lower mortgage interest rate on the overall loan amount without the PMI. So based on risk/return considerations alone, you are probably better off avoiding the PMI. Only a very low PMI rate would result a different outcome from that perspective.

Another consideration to make is whether putting the 37k aside instead of using them for a down payment would improve your worst-case scenario and could buy you additional time in case you have difficulties repaying the mortgage. Only you can figure out how much this ""option"" is worth, considering how secure your and your spouse's incomes are, what are you going to do with the 61k that remain even if you choose to pay down  and how much the monthly mortgage repayment is, compared to your income. Based on the information you provided, it seems that the 61k can last you for a significant period of mortgage repayments, so that the value of any additional cushion is probably very small.
","If you can put zero down, then do it. Your loan rate is what 3 to 3.5%. So for 30 years you'll have the lowest loan rate you'll probably ever have and probably get to itemize your deductions. Imagine getting only 8% return for the stock market for 30 years on 135k.... 1.3 Million. AND all stocks are ON SALE! 

Year This Year's Return Total Returns Total Money

  c) Drive home again.


The law seems to say that I am allowed to leave my house for exercise but does not stipluate how long this should take.  It also does not state that use of a car is not allowed.

Edit:

Yes, this question is against the ""spirit"" of the law, but that is not the question being asked, if we get into the morality of it then we have to start taking peoples rights into consideration, one of those rights is to go where they want and to do what they want, even if that means that someone else suffers in some way.  People have fought and died for our rights over hundreds of years, you cannot just ignore that.
","There is no clear answer, and I suspect an argument could be made either way. 

The relevant regulations in this case are The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020. In particular, regulation 6(1) states that:


  6.—(1) During the emergency period, no person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse.


In this case, you would be relying on the reasonable excuse given in regulation 6(2)(b):


  (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), a reasonable excuse includes the need—[...]
  (b) to take exercise either alone or with other members of their household;


The regulations do not explicitly state:


how far you may travel for the purposes of exercise,
how long you may exercise for
even, in contrast with government advice, how many times a day you may leave your house for exercise.


It would require the interpretation of the courts to decide whether travelling for long distances was reasonable in order to take exercise, and whether exercising for many hours is reasonable. Michael Gove stated in an interview that:


  I would have thought that for most people, a walk of up to an hour, or a run of 30 minutes or a cycle ride of between that, depending on their level of fitness is appropriate.


This is of course not law, but opinion; yet it is worth keeping in mind that the courts may take a similar view to this.

A strong argument could be made to say that this scenario is not in fact necessary exercise, but leisure, which is not considered a reasonable excuse in the regulations. Equally, it could be argued that the regulations do support travel for exercise in any form. I don't think anyone could answer with certainty whether this is legal or not, until the law is tested on this point.

Actually not one of those (actual) rights stipulate any such thing and is why there was long overdue ban on smoking in certain public places in the UK ... ie. smoking whenever and wherever you want, even if that means that someone else suffers in some way.  

In short, yes I believe you would be in violation of the 'spirit' of the law, which will be considered as mentioned above. Of course it was reasonable to leave for exercise but was it reasonable to travel that far and was it reasonable to do so for that amount of time? I believe you would not be able to justify the distance or the time.  Note: even less so now the government have updated the rules on excercise to include: 

'stay local and use open spaces near to your home where possible – do not travel unnecessarily'

'...once per day'

541,general,travel.stackexchange.com,"I will be travelling for more than 13 hours through South East Asia, most of the time in a crowded environment like airplane or transiting at the airport. What precautions should I take to reduce the chances of contracting any contagious disease, such as Corona Virus COVID-19?
","In February, I flew into Singapore through Seoul, and back the same way to Toronto. Singapore had a jump in cases just as we arrived; Seoul's jump was happening while we were in Singapore. Here is what we did:


hand washing pretty much every chance we got. (I say pretty much because if you walk a long way in an airport you will walk past multiple bathrooms; we didn't go in to each and every one and have a wash.) But we did sometimes go and wash even though we didn't need to use the bathroom. For example, every time we returned to our hotel room after being out.
hand sanitizer after handling money, before eating, or when sitting waiting
use sanitizing wipes to clean the airplane screen and trays immediately on getting to the seats. I should have done the seatbelt and arm rests too and will on my next trip.
try to pay by credit card, using contactless, and holding my own card instead of handing it to someone to tap for me, whenever possible. Avoid cash -- it really is filthy
don't touch handrails and other ""public"" surfaces unless you actually need them for support. Keep your hands to yourself as much as you can. In Singapore there was a lot of wiping going on, but in other places I have not seen that
really try to touch your face less. It's hard, you just need to watch videos of people telling you not to touch their face while people behind them touch their faces, and then moments later the speaker does too. It's hard. That's why all the handwashing and hand sanitizing is important
if you cough or sneeze, use a tissue or your elbow to confine it, so as to cause less distress to those around you and lower overall stress - to do this, you'll need a loose tissue in your pocket that you can grab quickly. If there's no nearby garbage, you'll need another pocket you can designate for dirty tissues. When you see a garbage, empty the dirty pocket and sanitize your hands to lessen the chance you're passing anything along.
monitor your temperature. In Singapore this was done for me many times a day. On return home I checked my temperature twice a day or so for 14 days to be sure I was not running a fever.
tell the truth when you come home. Don't be that person who lies about where they have been. 


In addition, at least one friend has taken a laptop on vacation, not because she might need it during the vacation, but in case she was quarantined in her destination or on return before she could get to her home. 

There are enough cases in Ontario now that when I go to Toronto and ride the public transit, I'm going to take all these same precautions. This is really not just a travel issue any more.
","The shuttles to the car rental area are pretty roomy unless you get unlucky and several flights arrive more or less simultaneously, in which case you could wait for the next one.  They come around every few minutes at most.

There is quite a lot of seating, plus standing is possible.  There is also a luggage storage area on the shuttle where quite a large number of bags can be placed.

558,general,travel.stackexchange.com,"I booked an easyJet flight from London to Zurich several months ago. I also have an annual Coverwise travel insurance policy. I am a Swiss citizen but resident in the UK. 

I was scheduled to return back on the 23rd of March but easyJet has cancelled that flight. I am able to get a refund or change my flight date on easyJet but the next available date is not clear and looks like it will be after the 23rd.

Is there any compensation for the extra expenses of hotels (not yet booked) and subsistence for the extra days in Switzerland from either the airline or the travel insurance?
","I assume you have already travelled London - Zurich, and it is your return which has been cancelled, stranding you in Switzerland.

Whilst Switzerland is not in the EU, it is a signatory to EC261/2004. Thus cancellation of a departure from Zurich is covered by that regulation. 

Since these are extraordinary circumstances, you will be unlikely to receive the usual levels of compensation for a cancellation within 14 days of scheduled departure. 

However, this is distinct from the duty of care provisions. Provided you have not opted for refund on your cancelled flight, then guidance issued just yesterday confirms that this still applies, despite (or arguably, because of) a potentially lengthy stay: 


  According to Article 9 of the Regulation, which provides all relevant details, passengers
  who are affected by a flight cancellation must also be offered care by the operating air
  carrier, free of charge. This consists of meals and refreshments in a reasonable relation to
  the waiting time; hotel accommodation if necessary, and transport to the place of
  accommodation. Moreover, airports are to provide assistance to disabled passengers and
  passengers with reduced mobility in accordance with Regulation 1107/20069
  .
  
  It is worth recalling that when the passenger opts for reimbursement of the full cost of the
  ticket, the right to care ends. The same happens when the passenger chooses re-routing at
  a later date at the passenger's convenience (Article 5(1)(b) in conjunction with Article
  8(1)(c)).
  
  The right to care subsists only as long as passengers have to wait for a rerouting at the
  earliest convenience (Article 5(1)(b) in conjunction with Article 8(1)(b)).
  
  The intention underlying the Regulation is that the needs of passengers waiting for their
  return flight or re-routing are adequately addressed. The extent of adequate care will have
  to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the needs of passengers in the
  circumstances and the principle of proportionality (i.e.: according to the waiting time).
  The price paid for the ticket or the length of the inconvenience suffered should not
  interfere with the right to care (Interpretative Guidelines Point 4.3.2).
  
  According to the Regulation, the air carrier is obliged to fulfil the obligation of care even
  when the cancellation of a flight is caused by extraordinary circumstances, that is to say
  circumstances that could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been
  taken.
  
  The Regulation contains nothing that recognises a separate category of 'particularly
  extraordinary' events, beyond the 'extraordinary circumstances' referred to in Article 5(3)
  of the Regulation. The air carrier is therefore not exempted from all of its obligations,
  including those under Article 9 of the Regulation, even during a long period. Passengers
  are especially vulnerable in such circumstances and events.10 In exceptional events, the
  intention of the Regulation is to ensure that adequate care is provided in particular to
  passengers waiting for re-routing under Article 8(1)(b) of the Regulation.


(from Commission Notice -Interpretative Guidelines on EU passenger rights regulations in the context of the developing situation with Covid-19, section 3.3.)
","I recall seeing Gayot Fow claim that this was possible, which one does not contradict lightly. On the other hand the ""conventional wisdom"" is that a Schengen consulate would probably refuse to examine a visa application from an Annex II national. And the Schengen rules I can find do not clearly seem to contemplate that possibility.

The rules context is quite different. A third-country national wishing to enter the UK needs to have either an ""entry clearance"" (applied for in advance) or ""leave to enter"" (granted by the immigration officer at the border). So having an entry clearance does, in principle, mean that you don't need to convince the IO to take the positive step of issuing a leave-to-enter, just that he should honor the entry clearance you already have.

In contrast the Schengen Borders Code states that all third-country nationals go through the same ""thorough check"", described in Article 8, subsection 3(a). Verification of a visa for Annex I nationals is in addition to that common procedure. At least as far as the EU legislation goes.

Neither does the Schengen Handbook for the processing of visa applications mention anything (in either direction) about visas for Annex II nationals.

This does not conclusively prove that there can't be an administrative practice of issuing visas to Annex II nationals who bother (and pay) to apply for one. But such a practice could well vary between member states. In particular, if you succeed in applying for a visa from one member state, and then enter the Schengen area through another member state, it might be that the border guards there would be confused rather than reassured if you present a visa.

Among people living with HIV, the routine use of LPV/r as treatment for HIV is associated with several side effects of moderate severity.

508,general,politics.stackexchange.com,"FactCheck.org considers Trumps claim that he inherited a broken CDC system to be 'misleading', and has given a long description of why they  made that ruling.  It effectively boils down to the claim that the CDC was never intended to be the sole producer of tests.  Instead they claim that the CDC was always intended to work with third parties and private sector to support the production of tests and other resources if a pandemic happened, and that the delays with testing was due to the CDC not allowing private sector agencies to build tests originally.

If it's true that the intent of the CDC was to support/regulate private sector test development, and that the CDC failed to do that, then the next question is why didn't it?  Why did the CDC not immediately open up production of tests to the private sector and support and vet those tests as factcheck.org claims was the original design intent?

Is there a specific individual or group of individuals who had the ability to decide to open up testing to private sector and failed to do it?  Was Trump or the white house in any way responsible for this decision to not open up testing to the private sector?
","Shorter answer: The Departments of the CDC, FDA, and HHS all are under the direction and guidance of the Trump administration. Failures of any one of these departments is the direct responsibility of the President. Parsing which department is most responsible for failure to immediately mobilize and deploy mass testing, while interesting, is an exercise in searching for a scapegoat.
","There are two plausible explanations, the first being that they didn't want to contribute to further splitting the Remain-voting bloc, and the other being that they couldn't find a candidate in time.

To provide context to the situation alluded to in the question; originally the main Remain-supporting parties, the Greens, the Lib Dems, Renew, and Change UK had all planned to stand down their individual candidates and back an independent, pro-Remain candidate. This was decided on Tuesday the 7th of May, two days before the deadline to register candidates, to be Femi Oluwole. 

After wrestling with the decision on whether or not to stand for two days, Oluwole eventually decided not to run on the morning of the deadline. The reasons he gave for his refusal were fear of splitting the remain vote, handing victory to the Brexit party, lack of local ties to the area, inability to dedicate enough resources to the by-election while also working on the European elections, and ethical reasons related to his involvement in the Our Future Our Choice campaign which he co-founded. Oluwole threw his support behind the Labour candidate, who had not been involved with the talks to run a unity candidate, and indeed, as the link in the OP says, ""made it clear that they would strenuously disrupt the campaign and obstruct an independent candidate"".

Faced with less than 24 hours to choose candidates to run before the May 9th deadline, it seems that Change UK either failed to find a candidate willing to stand for the party, or decided that running another pro-Remain candidate would help hand victory to the Brexit party by taking votes from the Labour candidate. Given that the candidate that they ended up supporting in the by-election, Renew's Peter Ward, eventually won just 45 votes, it seems likely that the party had found that their level of local support was negligible, and therefore that running a candidate would be wasteful, given the upcoming European elections. It is also possible, given that in April, Renew announced that they would support Change UK in the European elections, that there was some sort of private deal between the parties to trade support and pool resources.

In conclusion, then, it seems that while there is a lack of clarity surrounding this decision, and certainly no official explanation of their decision-making process besides wanting to avoid splitting the vote, by reading between the lines somewhat we can identify most of the factors that will most likely have influenced the decision.

I have been following recent developments in DIY ventilator design, which are normally focussed on a contraption to send positive pressure in a controlled cycle. The counterargument against these initiatives is that modern ventilators are complex and do, among other things, aspiration of liquid from the lungs because patients are intubated. Intubation itself requires sedation for long periods, which brings it's own problems.  

Why is such intubation necessary. Why not have a well-sealed mask? 
","When patients have respiratory problems due to low oxygen saturation then you can supplement the O2 of room air by using high flow oxygen at various concentrations above room air using nasal cannulae or masks such as a Hudson mask.

When they are unable to maintain adequate oxygenation levels with a mask, and/or suffering respiratory muscle fatigue, they are then placed on a mechanical ventilator.  The cuff on the intubation tube is to stop secretions falling back into the lung causing aspiration pneumonia as usually at this stage the patient is no longer able to protect their own airways. 

Some people have tried CPAP devices to supply air under pressure but that has the potential disadvantage of aerosolizing virus into the environment


  While that measure could stretch the supply of ventilators and save lives, it has a major drawback. Officials and scientists have known for years that when used with a face mask, such alternative devices can possibly increase the spread of infectious disease by aerosolizing the virus, whether used in the hospital or at home.
  
  Indeed, that very scenario may have contributed to the spread of COVID-19 within a Washington state nursing home that became ground zero in the United States. First responders called to the Life Care Center of Kirkland starting Feb. 24 initially used positive airway pressure machines, often known as CPAPs, to treat residents before it was known the patients were infected with COVID-19.

","This is only a partial answer. Actual studies on this are indeed hard to find.

First of all: the healing information waves of the herbs you bring near your astral body and other such nonsense will feature in some related answers; not here. 

Grain bags or cherry pit pillows are indeed used as a heat storage and delivery device. Only for heat delivery they currently feature as ""doesn't hurt, may help, increases comfort and well being"" for physician guidelines for lower back pain.

For the primary effect they are intended to deliver there might be even more convincing findings behind them:


  When heat over 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celsius) is applied to the skin, heat receptors deeper down, where the pain is, are switched on. The heat receptors in turn block the effect of chemical messengers that cause pain to be detected by the body.
  Specifically, King and his colleagues discovered that a heat receptor called TRPV1 can block P2X3 pain receptors.


The filling of these bags or pillows actually does matter for a variety of reasons.

In the past they were most popularly filled with simple grains like wheat, rice or barley. This provides a nice and even, down-weighing sensation of heat. But these are problematic because of their moisture content and inherent instability. They break down and dehusk, releasing harmful dust and particles. 

If used in this way they also tend to rot and mould quickly. Also the allergenic potential of the ingredients is concerning. This is another reason for not using them to apply cold: moulding will be even quicker then. For a quick make-shift heat applicator they might still be an option, just discard them after some very few uses to make sure.

Cherry pits seem less problematic in both regards, being described as a much ""drier heat"" but they too can be quite a surprising fire hazard when brought to heat in a microwave. 

From the manufacturer of a cherry stone pillow sold as medical equipment:


  Attention: Important safety information:
  
  
  Please do observe the specified heating instructions. Prolonged heating can cause higher energy and damage the pillow (ignition hazard)!
  Please warm the pillow under supervision and ensure it is not humid!
  Let the pillow cool before the next heating!
  […]
  Important Note:
  While using the cherry stone pillow for babies / children, please also note the following:
  Make sure the product is intact and sealed properly! For loose cherry stones can cause choking hazard and suffocation!
  Use only under close adult supervision!
  Check for the suitable temperature for your child using your elbow (max. 41°C)![…]
  
  Special instructions: To prevent decay/ formation of mold:
  Do not wash the Cherry stone pillows.
  Store product dry! Protect from moisture!
  


The heat storing and distribution properties of different fillers is an obvious variable to consider. Together with a parameter that is less easy to measure: coziness.

Adding other flowers, herbs and spices is often done for the non-part of this answer from the first paragraph. But when using it for delivering heat they obviously can relase volatile substances like essential oils which can have a variety of effects. Adding lavender flowers will smell beautifully and calm you down. However, all those additives I saw added to these pillows substantially increase the mould, allergy and fire hazards. If they are known or even just suspect to be effective and wanted it's probably best to use them isolated. 

So, yes: the content of the bags does matter quite a bit. Using hard and dry kernels – like cherry pits or grape seeds – seems as good as using just pure sand; and both are better than grains or colourful mixtures of sometimes dubious effect.

471,general,politics.stackexchange.com,"After last minute, party-line decisions by the US and Wisconsin Supreme Courts, Wisconsin will hold their presidential primary and a hotly-contested Supreme Court election tomorrow (April 7th) despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The state's Democratic governor has been pushing to delay the election and/or extend the window for absentee ballot collection, but the Republican controlled legislature have opposed both moves. 

In addition to the the potential for voters to get infected while voting, the vast majority of polling sites have been closed due to a lack of volunteers (most of whom are usually retirees) to run them:


  The state has faced serious questions about its ability to run an election amid the pandemic. With poll workers quitting out of fears of contracting the virus, more than 100 municipalities have said they lack enough staff to run even one polling place.
  
  Milwaukee typically has about 180 sites; this election the city plans to have five open. The head of the state elections commission raised the possibility in court testimony that some voters may have to head to a different town on Election Day because no one will be staffing the polls in their hometowns.
  
  Wisconsin Is Set to Vote on Tuesday After Court Overrules Governor’s Postponement - The New York Times

Even if they don't consider the threat of COVID-19 to be significant, the closure of so many polling places guarantees that people will be denied the opportunity to vote.
","Rural voters aren't afraid to go to the polls to keep a conservative state supreme court justice in power.

The April 2020 ballot does include the U.S. presidential primary, but that will have little effect on state politics.  After I first posted this answer, the New York Times echoed many of the points I make below, starting with:


  Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders are on the ballot in Wisconsin, but the main event is the State Supreme Court race between the conservative incumbent justice, Daniel Kelly, and a liberal challenger, Jill Karofsky.


Wisconsin has an elected state supreme court that currently has 5 conservatives and 2 liberals.  One of the conservatives (Daniel Kelly) is up for election in April 2020, and the another conservative is up in the next election after that (Pat Rogensack, 2023).  If liberals win both of those seats back, they would have a 4-3 majority and could undo the laws that keep the minority Republican party in power.


  The election determined the size of the court's conservative majority. A win for Karofsky would have reduced the conservative majority to 4-3, meaning that the next regularly scheduled election in 2023 would decide control of the court. A Kelly win would have preserved the court's 5-2 conservative majority.
  
  Ballotpedia


It's helpful to understand the political context:


For decades prior to 2010, Wisconsin was a moderate state.  The legislature and governorship each frequently flipped between the Democratic and Republican parties.  Since 1900, Wisconsin has equally chosen Republicans and Democrats for President.
Justices on the state supreme court are elected and technically nonpartisan.  Nonetheless, their conservative versus liberal ideology are often clear.  For decades prior to 2010, the state supreme court held a liberal majority.
It's worth mentioning that long ago, Wisconsin Republicans were leaders in open elections and progressive ideas.  The Republican party started in Wisconsin, as an anti-slavery party (later to be re-started in Michigan).  The word ""progressive"" was coined by Republican Robert La Follette.  Wisconsin was the first or among the first states to adopt women's suffrage, open ballots, primary elections, recall elections, referenda, outlawing child labor, worker's compensation, and income taxes; all were progressive Republican measures.  Prior to the Tea Party, the state was considered one of the most bipartisan and least corrupt states.
Led primarily by Tea Party candidates, in the fall 2010 election, Wisconsin Republicans won control of all three branches of government.  This included the election of Scott Walker as governor, a one-seat majority in the state senate, a considerable margin in the state assembly, and a 4 to 3 majority in the state supreme court.
Republicans quickly enacted a series of laws that would lock in their party's control:


Using sophisticated computer models to draw election maps for the U.S. House, state senate, and state assembly to maximize Republican seats and to pack Democratic votes into few districts.  The gerrymandering is so successful that in the 2018 elections, Republicans won 5 of 8 U.S. House seats with only 45.61% of votes, and 63 of 99 state assembly seats with only 44.75% of votes.
Adopting a voter-ID law.  Minorities and the poor -- who tend to vote for Democrats -- are less likely to have the proper types of identification.
Purged 234,000 voters from voting rolls.
Requiring early voting to be performed only at the municipal clerk's office, and not multiple sites.  Thus the 600,000 residents of Milwaukee (a Democratic stronghold) had only one site for early voting, the same as a town of 600 people would.  This law was struck down by a federal judge in 2016.


  
  A requirement that cities can have only one place for early voting. Critics have said large cities such as Milwaukee should be able to have multiple voting sites because not everyone can get downtown easily.
  

Limiting the days and hours for early and absentee voting.
Replacing the agency which oversees elections, from the Government Accountability Board composed of judges chosen by other judges, to the Wisconsin Election Commission chosen by politicians.
Moving the state supreme court elections from the fall (which have high Democratic turnout) to the spring (which have poor Democratic turnout).  This has been particularly effective at increasing the conservative control of the court, from 3-4 in 2010 to 7-2 in 2020.  Note how the election during the pandemic is a spring election, with a supreme court contest.
Holding special elections to fill vacancies on unusual dates -- when Republicans turn out -- instead of the usual fall and spring election dates when Democrats turn out.
After a series of failed recall elections for the governor and Republicans in the state senate, changes that made recalls more difficult (2015 Act 117).
A series of laws (most famously 2011 Act 10) to cripple the power and finances of labor unions, which are the primary backers of Democratic candidates.
In 2015, changing the Chief Justice position from the most senior justice (a liberal) to being chosen by a majority of the court (conservatives).
In 2015, stripping the powers of the Democratic secretary of state.
Increasing the powers of the Republican governor and attorney general.  When Democrats won back these offices in 2018, the powers of those offices were reduced in a lame duck session.

The conservatives controlling the state supreme court have upheld most of the laws described above.  This includes laws that affected the justices' own re-election.  In particular, the decision specifically about whether to continue the election during the pandemic went along ideological lines.
Moderate Republicans were treated poorly by the dominant Tea Party faction.  The previous Republican leaders of the legislature -- Dave Schultz in the assembly and Mike Ellis in the senate -- were pushed out of leadership by Tea Party leaders.  Schultz would later testify in a gerrymandering case that Republicans were brought one-by-one to a law office, and were ordered to vote for the gerrymandered maps, else their own districts would be gerrymandered to make them lose.  In the ensuing years, many moderate Republicans quit the party in disgust, and many moderate office-holders were voted out in primaries by Tea Party candidates.  The loss of moderates had drained the support of the Republican party.
Since 2010, Democrats have been gaining ground.  By number of voters statewide, the Republican party is actually a minority party in Wisconsin.  Wisconsin's top Republican even admitted that they aren't the majority:


  After the Republican Robin Vos, the speaker of the Wisconsin Statehouse, said that “if you took Madison and Milwaukee out of the state election formula, we would have a clear majority.""


However, the measures described above are so effective that the state supreme court and both houses of the state legislature still remain in Republican control.
Democrats swept every statewide office in 2018: U.S. Senate, governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, and treasurer.  They had more votes in the U.S. House, but because of gerrymandering, they won only 3 of 8 seats.  They also had more votes in the state assembly and gained one seat, but again because of gerrymandering, they did not gain control.
As has happened nationwide, the Wisconsin Republican party has aligned with rural interests and and the Democratic party with urban interests.  COVID-19 is likely to keep people in high-density (i.e. Democratic) districts at home.  Like other rural places in the U.S., rural Wisconsinites believe that COVID-19 is a ""big city"" phenomenon and are likely to show up to the polls.  Per the New York Times, about one of the least populous counties:


  Bruce Johnson, the Democratic chairman in Pepin County, along the state’s western border with Minnesota, said he pushed for absentee balloting but people were less concerned because they rarely wait in lines to vote.


Wikipedia:


  When the election went ahead on 7 April, access to easy in-person voting heavily depended on where voters were located. In smaller or more rural communities, which tend to be whiter and vote Republican, few issues were reported.


It's therefore in the interest of Republicans to keep the election going during the pandemic.
Should liberals take back the state supreme court, they can overturn the system of laws which keeps the Republican party in power.  They would then be at the mercy of the voters, who have been increasingly voting Democratic.

","Well if the tampering can be traced back and proven to have been effected by a person(s) then they could face criminal charges.  

If the tampering was enacted and planned by a foreign country then that country could face sanctions from the US/NATO/UN depending on who it was and what they did.  Any agents could be arrested/deported or have the consular privileges rescinded.  

But being the internet age any problems with the voting probably happened over the internet and the agents could have never set foot in the US.  The US may never be able to prove or even have more than guess work and conjecture about who was pulling the strings behind the curtain.  The US is unlikely to take any action against any significant country unless it can definitively prove that link.  But there are some countries that this might make a great justification for military action.  For instance if it was North Korea, or Syria then you can expect that the military will punish the entire country for the actions of its government.  Or at least that will be the excuse.

522,general,bicycles.stackexchange.com,"I am building my first road bike. I have been an avid biker rider for quite sometime and always thought about getting a road bike, just never got around to it.

Fast forward to now, my neighbor (pro rider) threw his Scott CR1 carbon fiber frame in the dumpster along with a MOST carbon handlebar and Cosmic wheel set.  Now that I acquired all this stuff for free, time to finally build a bike!

My point of this post is first to get some advice on ... where to start? How do I find out what is compatible to this bike from a component group, to putting everything together etc.

I know I won't be able to do everything but I know I can get pretty far then I am planning on taking it to a local guy to do a tuneup before I get her out on the road.

I want to build as tough and reliable as possible on a budget (don't want to spend a ton but want a quality bike). Let me know if anyone can help out with where to get started, also if you have parts for sale or anything or want to trade for something, I am wide open to that as well. Picture is attached, let me know what year as well if anyone knows. 

Thanks David


","
This frame is about 10 years old (the model was sold for a few years). There is a chance that there's a crack in the carbon fiber, which would be cause for concern. There are services that will perform non-destructive testing, and there are ways to perform inspections at home with somewhat less reliability, but that would be my first concern.
It looks like the bottom bracket is intact. If the bearings turn smoothly, keep them. If not, you'll want to replace them, which would probably be the most complex part of your build. It looks like this bike takes a PF86 bottom bracket (there are numerous standards).
This bike was sold with a Shimano 105 group (possibly other groups as well). 105 has good performance and good value, so you won't go wrong with that. You'll obviously need caliper brakes, not disk, but that's about the only requirement from the options that will be available to you.
It looks like it has a front derailleur braze-on, so you'll need to make sure you get a compatible derailleur.
There are a lot of other options that will be matters of personal taste. Crankarm length, chainring tooth counts, cassette tooth counts, saddle, pedals, bar tape color, etc.
This is not a marketplace or swap meet, so not a good place to find the parts you'll need.

  A quick search, however, shows other colors available to purchase. Concerning ""to be seen"" bicycle lights, should they be avoided?


Yes, they should be avoided.

First, off-colors might not be legal in your area.

Second, and more importantly, no one will know what it is.  If a driver sees a flashing red taillight, or what looks like a normal white headlight, that driver is likely to identify you and your bicycle.  Something like a blue light is likely to evoke a, ""Huh?  What's that?""  Which means most drivers won't treat you like a known entity - something they need to avoid.  

And what do drivers (and cyclists, for that matter) do about things that don't evoke a familiar ""must avoid"" response?  You won't even register as being there.  Think about it - how many random items to you ride past all the time?  Do any of them really register at all?

185,biomedical,bioinformatics.stackexchange.com,"In one of the answers to another question about the corona virus a link was given to this phylogenetic analysis of the virus.

Can somebody assist a non-bio type here? It seems to show that the current corona virus split from a virus in bats. And that the same ancestral virus is also ancestral to several other viruses, some in humans and some in bats. 

Is my understanding basically correct?
","Overview
The central focus of the tree is to highlight the key biological concern of the new coronavirus, 2019-nCov. The key concern is the genetic similarities to SARS epidemic, and relates to the SARS receptor. 

SARS background SARS is endemic in bats (your BioRxiv tree partly shows that and this tree definitely shows it) and in the 2002 epidemic infected civet cats which then infected humans. More importantly it is then transmitted from one human to another. This is a consequence of the SARS receptor been able to exploit the cellular receptors in the respiratory tract of bats, civet cats and humans and use this tissue as a site of replication. The concern is exacerbated because the tree here shows SARS independently infected humans on two separate occasions, suggesting the cross-over has an underlying genetic basis, which is part of the ""SARS lineage"".

BioRxiv 2019-nCov tree Your tree shows the 2019-nCov has a recent common ancestor with SARS in comparison to the rest of the betacoronaviruses. This therefore provides some circumstantial evidence the receptor mechanism and ability to frequently crossover from bats and ultimately transmit human to human could be shared with SARS. At an evolutionary level (which is what ANY tree is supposed to reconstruct) it raises the question which common ancestor of SARS did the ""SARS receptor"" originate. I'd need to draw a diagram to better demonstrate this point, but I hope you get the idea.

The ""influenza receptor"" The analogy is with influenza virus and the entire epidemiology of influenza hinges around is sialic acid receptor of influenza and its ability to bind on to the cellular receptors in the upper/lower respiratory tract of birds, pigs and humans. The hypothesised mechanism is called the mixing vessel theory and is the classic epidemiological understanding of how new pathogenic influenza pandemics occur. If you replace ""birds and pigs"" with e.g. ""bats, civet cats and humans"" you get the idea why this could be scary. We don't the intemediate host of 2019-nCov ... but I speculate there must be one, unless eating Cov-infected bats is common in China.

Technical details of the BioRxiv tree The tree is a nicely diverse selection of the beta-coronaviruses. The authors have rooted the tree using the outgroups of delacoronaviruses and gammacoronaviruses, so it is a good robust selection of outgroups which can be used to correctly identify the direct of evolution of betacoronavirus divergence. In tree theory (its formal name is phylogenetics theory), extensive rooting is good and minimises artefacts.

One of the earliest members of the betacoronaviruses to diverge is MERS (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome), which form a single ""clade"" (all viruses share a unique common ancestor) and these represent around 50% amino acid divergence from SARS/2019-nCov. The selection of MERS in the tree from both camels and humans looks good. The selection of other betacoronaviruses looks great, I wasn't aware of the ""ruminant clade""  at all involving buffalo, cow etc .. infections and there was an associated human infection. There are loads of bat isolates of the betacoronaviruses throughout the tree, but we eventually arrive at the ""SARS clade"". The authors show that 2019-nCov is an outgroup to the SARS clade and shows a close relationship to one (BioRxiv tree) or two (this tree) bat isolates. Looking at the precise SARS clade (better shown in this tree) we can see loads of bat virus associating with SARS lineages. We therefore assume the reservoir to SARS and likely 2019-nCov is bat, moreover that the single ancestor to both viruses was a bat (it is called a parsimonious hypothesis). 

The one thing the BioRXiv tree omits, for example with regards this tree, is the diversity of SARS and in particularly the two independent origins of SARS, which is a weakness of their analysis, particular if this fed into downstream analysis. It is not to say the authors were wrong, but it was uncool. 

Word of caution my understanding is the divergence between SARS and 2010-nCov is around 15% and this is a quite a large amount of genetic divergence, even if both viruses share a most recent common-ancestor, form part of the same clade and receptor peptide motifs. Nevertheless there is sufficient amino acid divergence to generate notable differences in epidemiology, clinical symptom and transmission. 

MERS, SARS and 2019-nCov mortality rates It is worth noting that within the betacoronaviruses the mortality rates between difference clinically important viruses is very different. MERS has a mortality rate of 40-60%, SARS is around 10% but 2019-nCov is &lt;2.5%. The 2019-nCov mortality rate is still important given it has infected more and could potentially infect alot more people than SARS.

Interestingly, myocardial infarction increases ACE2 expression in the heart in an animal model ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15671045 ).  The paper found no significant effect from ramipril, an ACE inhibitor, but I don't think I can assume ARBs would work the same way.  (I am suspicious they might increase it based on the increase in the product Ang(1-7) level - https://www.nature.com/articles/hr200974 )  Note that soluble sACE2 can bind cells that did not produce it, by an RGD independent association with integrin beta 1.

","I should follow up with some things I've found.  As a starting point, the normal expression pattern is available at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/path.1570 - note the staining of simple squamous epithelium in the alveoli and the endothelia of blood vessels.  Another paper details a sharp decrease in expression with age in rats, but I don't know if that extends to humans.

For regulation of expression, I was surprised to see that Google Scholar actually provides a very good assortment of search results, easier to work with than PubMed, which were topped by the MI regulation I described in the question.  Additionally https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/path.1670 (yes, that IS a different link) describes ACE2 expression in renal disease but not in normal kidney.  ACE2 expression correlated with proteinuria, but negatively with GFR. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-008-0988-x  There are discordant notes in some other situations: for example, subtotal nephrectomy decreased ACE2 expression in a way that was partially prevented by ramipril. https://portlandpress.com/clinsci/article/118/4/269/68827/Reduction-in-renal-ACE2-expression-in-subtotal

The mRNA and protein are both described in atherosclerotic lesions: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/path.2357 

In the lungs https://jvi.asm.org/content/79/23/14614.short describes a positive correlation with differentiation state in airway epithelium.  The regulation by HIF-1 alpha in hypoxia seems of special importance: https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajplung.90415.2008 but it is complicated (both positive and negative).

ACE2 is also expressed at high levels in placenta during pregnancy - at least in rats. https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.90592.2008

Last but not least, pharmacologic data is reviewed at https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11906-008-0076-0.pdf which describes up-regulation of ACE2 by angiotensin II receptor blockers, ACE blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers.  This includes the common drugs lisinopril and losartan.  (see also https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcmm.12573 ) Unfortunately the paper did not report substances inhibiting ACE2 expression.  But https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.00239.2008 reported that high glucose (!) or PKC inhibitors could reduce ACE2 expression.  (but the high glucose was causing kidney injury, which as described above could mean more ACE2...)  The anti-diabetes drug liraglutide increased ACE2: https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/156/10/3559/2422879  To top it all off?  SARS itself decreases ACE2 expression, and this might be part of the process injuring the lungs: https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1267

This is by no means a complete survey, and there is much I don't understand.  The relationship between ACE2 biology and the emerging COVID-19 risk groups seems apparent - as is the urgent need for research to determine which manipulations to ACE2 expression have positive versus negative effects on the prognosis of that disease.

Update: a NEJM podcast today described this biology as 'complicated' link.  It is clearly of interest, but still under investigation.  For example, losartan is presently the subject of two clinical studies news, presumably these ClinicalTrials

150,biomedical,health.stackexchange.com,"According to this article, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could be effective treatments for Covid-19.


  Assuming the drugs are well tolerated in clinical trials and seem effective at treating COVID-19, the FDA will take measures to increase the nation's supply, according to Hahn.


Assuming best case scenario, when could these drugs be made widely available to treat the disease? By ""when,"" I mean how long is it likely to take?
","Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.. chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (and possibly in concert with azithromycin) have been touted over the past few days as a possible treatment regimen.

And there's some cause for that - the antiviral properties of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in vitro are broad and it's been trialed against various things (HIV, Ebola etc), however this hasn't always transferred particularly well into an actual treatment. And there's some research suggesting that it can successfully battle SARS-CoV-2 in vitro too. However, killing something in a petri dish is one thing, treating a disease in a human is another.

There has been some preliminary trials done - I believe there's been some fairly non-specific vagueness about it being promising when used in China and there's a relatively new study that's come from Gautret et al in France.

The Gautret et al paper looks promising - on the surface. It seems to suggest that treating people with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin looks great:



Unfortunately though it's not that simple.. first up we aren't talking about a great number of people here. The entire study comprised 42 patients (16 of which were the control), which isn't a huge sample size. And any patients who were on the treatment who got worse were removed from the analysis:


  Six hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were lost in follow-up during the survey because of early cessation of treatment. Reasons are as follows: three patients were transferred to intensive care unit, including one transferred on day2 post-inclusion who was PCR-positive on day1, one transferred on day3 post-inclusion who was PCR-positive on days1-2 and one transferred on day4 post-inclusion who was PCR- positive on day1 and day3; one patient died on day3 post inclusion and was PCR-negative on day2; one patient decided to leave the hospital on day3 post-inclusion and was PCR-negative on days1-2; finally, one patient stopped the treatment on day3 post-inclusion because of nausea and was PCR-positive on days1-2-3. 


So the picture isn't quite as rosy as the graph makes it look. Some people on this treatment still got worse, one died.

It get's even shonkier (technical term) when you look at the large swathes of control patients who didn't have the PCR test done for viral loads:



They effectively only properly measured the viral loads for 4 of the 16 control patients, so trying to compare the groups is verging on meaningless.

So before we look at ""when"" they'll be widely available to treat SARS-CoV-2 I'd be more concerned with answering whether they should be used to treat it. Hydroxychloroquine is not exactly harmless - while less toxic to humans than chloroquine, it's not something to give lightly, it can have immunosuppressant effects, and in sufficient dosages can result in potentially lethal cardiotoxicity.

It may yet prove to be an effective treatment - and the WHO is trialing it (along with other potential treatments) as part of their mega-trial SOLIDARITY, but let's not get too excited just yet.
","Not only in adults, even in children, if treated too late, the bone changes can be irreversible - they may not re-morph naturally.

  Because upper airway obstruction is an obstacle to normal dentofacial
  development, mouth breathing children deserve prompt attention before

371,general,money.stackexchange.com,"We all hear about the massive fluctuations of the stock market due to fears and responses to the coronavirus pandemic. The market also has also triggered ""circuit breakers"" that temporarily halt trading to prevent massive swings. 

What could potentially happen if they just halted all trading for the next two months as a medium-term circuit breaker? Assume they did it at night without warning so that people couldn't get trades in before the closure. Would the rest of the economy continue to function otherwise (other coronavirus effects not withstanding)? During the closure, I would imagine that stock prices would just stay the same and then companies would adapt to their changing supply and demand situation as needed, right? 

Once it opened again there might be a swing once we know which companies have survived the pandemic and which won't but that speculation is happening on a daily basis now, why not just close it to prevent chaos and allow companies to think longer term without worrying about momentary market valuation?
","This idea of an extended ""market holiday"" is a completely normal idea.  A lot of people have had this idea, especially today, and I'll tell you below why it's terrible.  Just flat-out bad.  I once had this idea during the GFC when I was also new-ish to the market, so don't feel bad.  

I believe one of the CNBC hosts was touting this idea this morning.  A simple way to refute one of the underlying notions here is thus: If you don't like what you see then just go ahead and close your eyes, and the bad thing will go away right?  Of course not.

You might say ""Maybe the market just doesn't know what stocks are worth right now and that's why the market is down.""  I'd answer  that no one ever really knows exactly what a business/stock is worth (some exceptions aside).  Generally, people who sell think it's worth less than the price and people who buy think it's worth more, so why do we need to shut the market?  

You might say ""Maybe not everyone feels comfortable trading or feels like they know what this specific business/stock is worth right now so that's why we should halt trading.""  I'd answer with why can't the people that do want to trade continue trading and if you don't know/ just aren't ""comfortable"" then step aside, no one is forced to trade (unless maybe they used leverage/need the money).  

The punchline on extended market holidays, reiterated: Except in cases of traders or technology used to trade actually being unavailable/overtaxed for some reason, it's something we should avoid at all costs.  There are lots of negatives, and I'm not aware of any positives outside of the corner cases mentioned above.

A surprise trading halt as you mentioned of an extended variety is one of the worst things that can be done to a market.  Imagine...


Surprise! That thing you owned that you thought was liquid and you could buy or sell on most days Monday-Friday, excepting holidays, actually isn't!  And if you need to raise money between now and the market re-opening, tough! 
When the market does re-open, going forward, everything in that market should be priced more cheaply in one respect, and that is to account for a new illiquidity premium that has been introduced to the market.  All else equal, if you could own the same stock on two exchanges and one had random extended trading halts while the other didn't, there should be a disparity in the pricing, albeit not massive, between the two.  I'd rather own the one that trades more frequently.  Illiquidity in an asset is not a good thing.  
Just because something isn't trading and its price stays the same doesn't mean its value is not changing, it just means that it's harder to estimate(no one can truly see it) that true value.  It's quite possible that when the market reopened some of the companies would be worthless.  See the bullet two down on the economy for more info here. 
It's harder for everyone to deal in securities that have random extended halts because of those halts, which hurts liquidity even further going forward.  Less liquidity is bad.
The rest of the economy would continue to function, but not as well as it would with the market open.  So many transactions happen in the market on a daily basis and while some of these are retail or professional investors trading in the market, many of these trades are transactions where one company is hedging their exposure to another company.  Or, just using the market to see a gauge of the health of their counterparty to determine if they're going to engage in a business transaction and if so at what level with what other terms.  Imagine one company is buying components from another.  Each will look at the markets to judge the health of the other in their negotiations.  Without functioning markets, that process gets more difficult and it is exponentially more difficult at times of stress when companies are worried about the health of other companies.  That is when it is most important for markets to be open.  If markets are not, distrust reigns and activity/deals between companies grind to a halt.  That harms the economy.
Closing the market doesn't allow companies to think longer term.  Closing the market causes everyone to speculate which companies are in credit trouble and won't be around.  Others seek to limit or avoid exposure to the firms that might be failing by cancelling orders and halting shipments. Just the rumor that someone is in trouble will cause others to stop dealing with that firm and then it really is over for the company in question.  If the market was open that didn't have to happen.
The ""chaos"" you describe is simply the process of price discovery in times of uncertain economic outlook.  The market is volatile, it is what it is.  Instead of wondering what companies are likely worth for the next two months we can let them trade and have a best estimate.  That's what the market is, an estimating machine for the value of businesses. 
Those values are very important to businesses as they do business with each other.  The stock market is not some pure speculation machine/ random number generator that pushes values around willy-nilly.    
Think of it this way: Maybe I don't like when prices change so we should just have stocks trade once a year, then everyone can really ""plan long term?""  That sounds ludicrous right?  It's the same idea.
The world is a scarier place, companies are making less, businesses are hurting, people are dying and stocks are worth less as a result.  Closing our eyes won't make the situation any better.  Restricting trade by closing the market would hurt the underlying economy.  Trade is generally a pretty good thing.

","The simple reason is that they don't need and can't use liquidity; they know when they expect their foreign currency denominated cashflows will fall (within a reasonable range of dates) so they buy futures with the intention of taking delivery at maturity. OK that's not entirely true because the futures normally deliver financially rather than as an FX trade but the maths shows that the outcome is equivalent.

One other key thing to consider is that the company wants to lock in the exchange rate in the future, at the time when the cashflow occurs, rather than the current exchange rate. It doesn't matter (much) whether that rate is better or worse than spot, it is the rate they need to make their exchange at.

So, what the companies are doing is hedging the exchange rate that their future cashflows will be exchanged at rather than hedging the exchange rate at the current time but there is another, linked, reason why they don't make the exchange at spot in the current period; they don't actually have the cash to do so right now. These future cashflows have not been realised yet so they literally don't have the cash to spare now to convert to or from a different currency to complete the trade that you are suggesting. They will only have the cash available at the date when the exchange needs to be done so how can they use that cash in the current period?

 “They can still carry the virus in their bodies,” Gupta said. “They could potentially still shed the virus and be a source of infection.”

Also all leaders have been polling better in this crisis, and most have been polling much higher than Trump . In a Fox News poll:

Covid-19 is the result of a zoonotic outbreak from bats to an intermediate ( and unidentified host ) thence to humans.  It is thought that bats don't suffer the disease themselves as they carry low levels of virus but the intermediate host modifies the virus, and amplifies it so that it vastly increases the amount of virus that can shed into the environment infecting humans.  One possible scenario is that bat coronavirus combined with a fish coronavirus inside the intermediate host.  This is based on the observation that the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene shares a 39-base insertion with a type of soldierfish that swims in the South China Sea.

The SARS-CoV-2 infects humans via the ACE2 surface receptor, but this receptor is not only found in humans.  Other animals have similar but not exactly the same ACE2 receptors and several dogs and one cat have returned positive swabs for SARS-CoV-2.  The cat developed covid-19 symptoms.  The first dog died two days after being released back to its owner but that might have been from the stress of quarantine in a 17 year old Pomeranian.  Ferrets also have an ACE2 receptor which also binds strongly to the SARS virus so presumably are also at risk. Mice appear to be less at risk.


  This is the first human-to-cat transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). About a week after its owner got sick with COVID-19, after returning from a trip to Northern Italy, the cat developed coronavirus symptoms: diarrhea, vomiting and respiratory issues, Steven Van Gucht, virologist and federal spokesperson for the coronavirus epidemic in Belgium, told Live Science.
  
  The owner sent samples of vomit and feces to Dr. Daniel Desmecht's lab at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Liège. Genetic tests showed high levels of SARS-CoV-2 in those samples, he said. ""The cat recovered after 9 days,"" Van Gucht said.


The Hong Kong Govt is now asking that pets of infected patients must now be quarantined for 14 days.

The CDC gives the following advice (which is out of date based on the above):


  If you are sick with COVID-19 (either suspected or confirmed), you should restrict contact with pets and other animals, just like you would around other people. Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. This can help ensure both you and your animals stay healthy.
  
  When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. Avoid contact with your pet including, petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with them. For more information visit: What to Do if You are Sick.


We don't have information on cows but presume that they may also be susceptible.

EDIT: Experimental data suggests cats are more susceptible to the virus than dogs


  The team, led by virologist Bu Zhigao, infected five domestic cats with SARS-CoV-2 through the nose. When two of the cats were euthanized six days later, the researchers found viral RNA, as well as infectious virus particles, in their upper respiratory tracts.
  
  The other three infected cats were put in cages next to three uninfected felines. The team later detected viral RNA in one of the non-infected cats, which suggests that they contracted the virus from the infected cats through respiratory droplets. All four cats also produced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in cats should be considered as part of efforts to eliminate COVID-19 in humans, the authors note in the preprint, which has not been peer reviewed.


and


  Dogs, however, were less susceptible to the virus. The researchers infected five young dogs and found that two excreted viral RNA in faeces, but none contained infectious virus.
  
  Similar investigations in pigs, chickens and ducks identified no viral RNA in animals deliberately infected with the virus, or those exposed to the infected animals

","In short, the answer (regarding diseases) is yes. 

Anytime you deal with blood or other bodily fluid, you risk catching a variety of diseases. The risk is compounded if you are not wearing proper protective equipment, washing your hands after handling them and covering breaks in skin before handling. Here is a list of the diseases you could end up with as well as a list of other fluids and how exposures can occur. 

If you would like to learn more and be able to better assist your patients, you should take first aid classes. Also, if you think that you have a high likelihood of coming in contact with blood or other fluids, you should consider carrying a pair of disposable medical gloves and safety glasses in your vehicle (or backpack... Something that is often with you).

If you live in an area that has fairly prompt ambulance response, you are much better off not trying to take the patients to the hospital. Instead, if it is safe to do so, try to redirect traffic around the patient so that they don't get hit again and try to keep bystanders a few feet back from the incident so that they do not get hit as well. Try to avoid completely stopping traffic as this can effect the emergency vehicle's ability to get to the scene. 

Your safety on scene is your priority, if you have the equipment, training to do so and ability to not get hit in the process, you should attempt to provide care to the patients. If any of those factors is not possible, you are much better off trying to keep the patient calm, keep bystanders at a distance - if possible - and try to keep the patient(s) from getting hit again. 

I hope this is helpful to you. Please feel free to ask questions if you need clarification.

""So, as a species, we all need to accept some responsibility and wake up to the fact we need to treat our planet better but, there is no one person or culture that we need to blame here.""","There are currently no formal restrictions on moving house, although the government has strongly advised against it where possible. It says that while there is no need to pull out of transactions, buyers and renters should delay moving so they can observe social distancing and self-isolating guidelines.

If the house you are moving into is empty, it's fine to carry on as long as these rules are observed during the removals process. If the property is occupied, the government is encouraging the buyer and seller to find an alternative moving date further down the line.

Mortgage lenders have also been tightening their restrictions, with some requiring a deposit of at least 25%. But this doesn't affect mortgages which have already been agreed. Many lenders are offering customers who have already exchanged the option to extend their mortgage offer for up to three months so that they can move at a later date.

This timeframe may give you some idea of how long all of this could go on for, although nobody knows for sure.

A lot of news on the internet say that it's not advised but I feel like they're making a big deal of it and there's nothing to worry

Should we stay or can we travel there safely?
","The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the US government's public health agency, currently gives the following advice about travel to Italy:


  Warning - Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel—Widespread Community Transmission
  
  CDC recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to Italy. There is limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas.  ... If you must travel:
  
  
  Avoid contact with sick people.
  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
  Clean your hands often by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at 60%–95% alcohol. Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty.
  
  
  It is especially important to clean hands after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose.
  Supplies of hand sanitizer, tissues, and other hygiene products may be limited, so consider bringing them with you.
  
  Pay attention to your health during travel and for 14 days after you leave.
  


It is probably advisable to postpone travel to Italy at this time.

Note that this advice is comparable to the ""Level 3"" advice for China and South Korea.  For those countries, the CDC recommends that everyone avoid all nonessential travel.
","Partial answer for the Israeli side of things:

I don't use guns myself, but I consulted The AirSoft factory, a BB-gun/air-gun store in Israel. They told me the following:

You need an official approval from the ministry for the economy to take an air-gun out of Israel. To do so, you contact them, give them the item's serial number (and probably more details), and they contact the customs at the airport to let you through when you get there. I've been told that at the minimum this takes 2 weeks - and even that if you're willing to pester them every day, otherwise it'll be longer. Also I'm not sure whether or not you'll need a written approval from them. I mean, I was told you won't, but I wouldn't trust that. Israel is rather uptight about security.

So I would like to check how many cases were there in Italy about 10 days ago, to maybe predict the future cases in Germany (possibility that all flights to Germany will be banned too).

347,general,parenting.stackexchange.com,"So tonight at bedtime, my child was wanting someone to stay with them (until they fell asleep). We have had a busy few days so maybe they were just wanting some quality time. 

However I am a little concerned that they may be feeling unsettled. Given COVID-19 we have been encouraging them to wash their hands more often and properly, and to make sure they catch their cough in their elbow. Explaining that people can get sick if (we all) don't do that. This made them think they were sick.

So tonight I wanted to ask if they were feeling ok. But I didn't want to give them any leading prompts, in case I projected that worry onto them. I tried asking why they wanted mummy or daddy to stay next to them and they answered 'Because I want you to stay next to me'. Hmmm a tautology. Technically true but not very useful. 

Are there any techniques which are useful to tease out if and why a child may be unsettled, without suggesting something that is not there they then may absorb and think they should be worried about?

They also aren't very noisy (some cats are very noisy), and they're fairly passive aggressive about attention. I'm not saying that it will absolutely work for you, because it depends on the person as well as the cat. My aunt has a kitten who's a little hellion on speed, but plenty of cats are calm.

","In the last decades, several studies investigating the effect of protein on satiety showed that under most conditions, protein can be more satiating than isoenergetic ingestion of carbohydrate or fat.

This effect has been observed both after a single meal and over 24h. The effect of protein on satiety may be dependent on the type of protein ingested (animal protein, whey vs casein)

The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying satiety after protein intake seem to include stimulation of gastrointestinal hormones that affect gastrointestinal motility. Additionally, some studies suggest that ghrelin concentration, a hormone involved in regulation of food intake, might change in response to protein intake.

518,general,politics.stackexchange.com,"There are numerous articles talking about how people are tired of staying in lockdown:


  As Greece enters its third week since restrictive measures were first
  imposed to combat the spread of coronavirus, there is mounting concern
  that fatigue is setting in amid signs of people beginning to flout the
  policies.
  
  Speaking to ANT1 TV, the government spokesman Stelios Petsas said the
  centre-right administration was now considering placing a time limit
  on the movement of citizens outdoors, the Guardian reports.


Are there any polls which attempt to track how much people are content with staying under lockdown?
","The day after lockdown measures were implemented in the UK, YouGov conducted a poll of 2788 adults testing whether they supported or opposed the imposition of the measures.

They found that 76% of respondents strongly supported the measures, 17% somewhat supported them, and only a combined 4% opposed them in any way.

Just over two weeks later, on April 9th, they conducted another poll which asked respondents whether they would support or oppose lockdown restrictions being extended further than the initial three week period.

It found that while strength of support may have dropped slightly, the public was still overwhelmingly in favour of an extended lockdown, and that any drop in support was fairly negligible - combined opposition was found to be 5%, with combined support at 91%.

Indeed, YouGov has also found that at least in one part of the UK, respondents think that the lockdown doesn't go far enough - a poll published on April 10th that surveyed adults in Wales found that a majority (53%) thought that the lockdown measures should be tightened, with only 6% thinking that the measures should be relaxed.

I think we can conclude from this that although there may be a small amount of quarantine fatigue given the slight drop in strength of support for the lockdown measures between March 24th and April 9th, the public still remains overwhelmingly content with the measures at the moment, and there is evidence that at least one constituent country of the UK may support a tightening of the lockdown measures.
","
  Why than do Republicans continue to cut these programs?


For the same reason Willie Sutton robbed banks.  That's where the money is.  

From Politifact, percent of federal spending:  


  
  25.3% Social Security
  28% Health (Medicare, Medicaid, etc.)
  16.2% Defense
  4% Veterans
  4% Food and Agriculture (including food stamps)
  4% Transportation
  3% Education
  2% International Affairs
  13% everything else (including welfare)
  


So between them Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other health spending make up 53% of the budget, and that percentage is growing.  

Even though Social Security and Medicare have specific taxes to fund them, those taxes don't actually fully fund the programs.  Both programs spent more than they received during the last recession.  Absent another recession, they might fund themselves through 2021.  The trust funds would be depleted entirely around 2034.  

Medicaid does not have its own taxes, so it is always paid out of the general fund.  

By contrast, Defense, Veterans, and International Affairs are only 22%, less than either Social Security or health alone.  And Republicans tend to be of the opinion that Defense is underfunded.  

The other alternative is to increase taxes, and the Republicans are against increasing taxes.  Since spending is projected to grow, to keep the deficit constant, they have to ""cut"" spending.  Of course, in reality, spending on Social Security and Medicare will continue to rise regardless.  The ""cuts"" are really only slowing the rate of growth from its current projected amount.  

Well, there is one other alternative.  They could increase the retirement age.  That both increases tax revenues from people working longer and decreases spending.  And it does so without increasing the tax rate.  That's essentially what the last bipartisan deficit commission recommended before Barack Obama rejected it.  


  Do they want all three of these programs eliminated completely? 


Perhaps some do, but most want the programs to be self-funded out of the existing set-aside money.  There is currently no one recommending an absolute drop in spending in either Social Security or Medicare.  Both will increase every year under any plan actually proposed in Congress.

In countries where human rights are applied, they are, as you say, ""core"" values. So ""core"" that, when they are applied, it makes no sense / gives no useful information just to say that you are ""pro-human rights parties"".

Imagine the USA Democratic or Republican party running an ad saying that they are against slavery, or people being put in jail without due process. At best, it is time wasted because it will neither report to the voters any new information nor remark any difference against the other political parties. At worst, the public will be confused as why the party feels they need to make such a pointless statement (imagine Obama addressing the nation to state that he is against using the CIA to kill Republican politicans).
In countries were human rights are not applied, there are usually parties that try to promote them. Note that in many cases, they will not defend them collectively, but rather the individual rights. This is useful because:


people will understand more easily ""freedom of association"" than a more abstract ""human rights"".
""Human rights"" as a label may be seen as an external politic guideline (decided by a few countries), strange to the country culture (for example, Chinese officials often claims that the concept of the Human Rights is the product of Western culture and not appliable to Chinese politics. Defending particular rights is a way to bypass that affirmation and focus in the actual rights being demanded.
Some countries may be receptive to some Human Rights and not to others, for example maybe Saudi Arabia is more receptive to allowing association rights than, say, religious freedom or women's rights. Even people who are in favour of all the ""Human rights"" may chose to demand only those that are realistic demands.
And last but not least, in many countries without Human Rights, demanding the Government to change its polices is heavily prosecuted, both legally and illegally.

CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product. Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon. Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.

To be effective against killing some types of germs, hand sanitizers need to have a strength of at least 60% alcohol and be used when hands are not visibly dirty or greasy.
Do not rely on “Do It Yourself” or “DIY” recipes based solely on essential oils or formulated without correct compounding practices.
Do not use hand sanitizer to disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects. See CDC’s information for cleaning and sanitizing your home.

Person-to-person transmission is most likely between people in close contact, about 6 feet. When a person infected with novel coronavirus sneezes or coughs, respiratory droplets could land on people nearby or could possibly be inhaled by those people.

While the virus can be transmitted by touching objects or surfaces contaminated with COVID-19, health experts don't currently believe that's primarily how it's transmitted.","While specific guidelines vary from city to city, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised that Americans practice social distancing, and stay home, avoid mass gatherings and maintain 6 feet between themselves and others whenever possible. These efforts are intended to help ""flatten the curve,"" which means distributing the number of coronavirus cases over a longer period of time, to avoid overwhelming the health care system.

Americans should continue to uphold proper flu season hygiene. Wash your hands often, stay home if you're sick and cough or sneeze into your elbow rather than your hand.

If schools in your district have not yet closed, Dr. William Schaffner, medical director for the nonprofit National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, suggested sitting down and outlining a plan for how your family might handle schools and businesses closing.

To reduce the need for people to go to DMV offices during the coronavirus pandemic, the deadline of October 1, 2020 has been postponed until October 1, 2021.  Thanks to choster for linking to an initial report by Bloomberg News.

Several news organizations have been reporting the new deadline at least since yesterday evening.  An official press release from the acting Secretary of Homeland Security is dated yesterday, March 26 2020.

The page quoted below has now been updated, as have the quotes themselves.  I've also adjusted the answer to account for the fact that Pennsylvania is now compliant with Real ID rather than being on an extension.



Have a look at https://www.dhs.gov/real-id-public-faqs:


  Q: When will I need to change how I travel domestically?
  
  Beginning October 1, 2021 every state and territory resident will need to present a REAL ID compliant license/ID, or another acceptable form of identification, for accessing Federal facilities, entering nuclear power plants, and boarding commercial aircraft. The card, itself, must be REAL ID compliant unless the resident is using an alternative acceptable document such as a passport or passport card, or state-issued Enhanced Driver’s License. The Act does not require individuals to present identification where it is not currently required to access a Federal facility (such as to enter the public areas of the Smithsonian) nor does it prohibit an agency from accepting other forms of identity documents (such as a U.S. passport or passport card).


You can use a Pennsylvania-issued document (license or ID card), even if the document is not compliant, through September 30, 2021.  After that, you'd need a compliant document or one issued by the federal government (for example, a passport or passport card).

Is Pennsylvania compliant?  Does it have an extension?  See the main Real ID page at https://www.dhs.gov/real-id, which shows a map indicating that Pennsylvania is compliant.  You can choose Pennsylvania in the ""select a state"" box below the map to see the details:


  Pennsylvania is compliant with the REAL ID Act. Federal agencies can accept driver's licenses and identification cards from Pennsylvania at Federal facilities and nuclear power plants.


On or after October 1, 2021, you'll need a Real-ID-compliant driver's license or your passport (or another document from the TSA list, if you have one).

554,general,travel.stackexchange.com,"A friend of mine is currently in Cuba and was due to return to the UK on 2 April travelling Holguin> Montreal with Air Canada, and onwards to London Gatwick with BA (single PNR, booking made direct via the Air Canada website).

Yesterday she received an email cancelling her flight but without giving any alternative. Long-distance communication from Cuba can be difficult, so far she has been unable to contact the airline to find out if they will re-book her on an earlier flight.

I have tried to help her from the UK, but the ‘manage my booking’ option just directs me to a toll free number that doesn’t connect. I tried calling their Customer Services number in Canada but, unsurprisingly I suppose, could not get through.

FWIW, she is a UK citizen married to a Cuban citizen/resident but will need to try to extend her 60 day visitor visa (usually the maximum allowed) if she is trapped in Cuba. She is a 15 hour bus journey away from Havana and if possible needs to depart from Holguin. Only a few airlines fly into Holguin, the only realistic alternative would be Condor via Frankfurt, then Lufthansa to UK.

To date I don’t recall seeing many questions about Air Canada and flight cancellations. I am aware that they are offering a flexible change policy right now. 

My question is: 


has anyone else been in this situation with Air Canada since the COVID-19 emergency erupted? Given that her cancelled flight was more than 48 hours away, can we expect Air Canada to email her again in the next couple of days with information about an alternative flight? Any advice (apart from the obvious around continuing efforts to contact the airline)?

","Answering my own question:


No further contact from Air Canada following the cancellation email
It was impossible to contact them via any means
With assistance from friends back in the UK (eg looking up flight availability, checking on the status of travel restrictions relevant to potential routing options), my friend managed to get home to the UK by travelling overnight Monday to Havana to board an Iberia flight Havana>Madrid>London, arriving home after c48 hours travelling.


Her spouse does not have residency in the UK so remains behind in Cuba.

So, the answer to what to do in the unprecedented situation we’re all facing is be proactive, don’t wait for events to overtake you. Make your own arrangements to get home.
","Your situation seems to be well in hand... but for others, another option is to contact your own embassy.  

As far as the embassy is concerned, this is called ""repatriation"": returning citizens to homeland.  At extremes, they'll send government aircraft*. But far more likely they'll just use their contacts within the airline** to get the flight you already paid for straightened out. 

In the event of a government-flown rescue like this, it is common for government X to give courtesy flights to government Y's citizens; so for instance the UK might have their citizens hitch a ride on a US State Dept. flight to Miami, rather than send a flight from the Cayman Islands and then on to (gosh, probably Miami). 





* For instance, America's State Dept. has the pull to get a military C-5 sent; some China evacuation was done by a Kalitta Air 747, under contract to the US military. However the State Dept. also has its own internal aircraft fleet also, including turboprops as large as Bombardier Dash-8's.

243,expert,chemistry.stackexchange.com,"I did asked before , but apparently providing a link to a science report of harmless for humans (both skin and eyes) far-UV light was not enough to make people understand the significance of the solution to the raging COVID-19.
So this link (please read a bit of it):
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w
Says that the UV light of wavelength 222 nanometers (the photons bounces off the skin and the eyes) is absolutely harmless and do not make neither skin cancer or cataract. So this light is deadly for viruses and is not commercially available to anyone like ordinary humans (perhaps only some labs got it but sure cannot by on amazon or ebay or so). So if you wish to protect people you ideally need something to kill the virus in mid-air exactly as this lamp does.
Cite: ""By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207–222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin."" - this line is at the beginning of the link above.
So my idea is to help ordinary people that have some DIY experience to make a lamp and disinfect the clothes and themself like skin and face and face mask and so.
So a guy good in chemistry of similar that ca help with his knowledge and experience to help the people and get rid of the virus.
The research I did in the internet says that the UV has ability to kill virus in 10 seconds.
So having a lamp emitting harmless 222nm UV light instead the cancer deadly 254nm UV germicidal lamps will be able to protect from the diseases.
The question is how to make it.

so I suppose you can type a good way to do it and save the half of the western world population (the old people like your grandma and grandpa)?

(Nobody needs glass (or quartz) blowing of a lamp. Neither skills beyond the ordinary DIY - well it might be a need of experienced DIY-er.)
","UVC is very harmful to people and requires specialist equipment to create and use safely

You are not going to be able to create or use lamps that emit 222nM light without specialist equipment, and even if you could it would almost certainly not be safe.

Far UV lamps are widely commercially available for germicidal applications and these usually use mercury vapour fluorescent discharge tubes with no phosphors so have a strong emission around 250nM from a line in the mercury emission spectrum. They are very dangerous to people and have caused significant harm when used accidentally (see this video from BigClive describing what happens when they are used accidentally instead of the much less harmful ""black light"" tubes commonly used for discos and events). 

Another important fact to bear in mind is that UVC lamps of this type have to use specialist glass in manufacture because common types of glass strongly absorb UVC wavelengths. So, while they are readily available, they are not easy for an amateur to make.

You report a claim from a Nature paper than a tightly controlled UVC light of around 222nM wavelength is not harmful to people. I would be far more cautious as the Nature paper did not do extensive safety studies on the actual effect on people and given what we know about wavelengths not much longer, the claim would need some extensive validation.

But you have bigger problems than this in your pursuit of an easy-to-make solution accessible to amateurs. First, you cannot easily get around the problem of the glass used absorbing the wavelengths you want to see: you will need specialist material. Second, the actual excimer lamps as used in the nature paper are sophisticated devices that cannot easily be made by non-specialists (they are far more complex than the relatively conventional discharge tubes used in commercial UV lamps which are essentially the same as conventional visible fluorescent lamps apart from the need for specialist glass). Apart from anything else the lamps have a strong emission at around 258nM, exactly the wavelength known to be very dangerous to people from simple UVC mercury vapour lamps. The NAture paper reported using specialist narrow band filters to eliminate those wavelengths. These are unlikely to be easy to obtain. Third, creating the excimer lamps is a sophisticated process requiring specialist pulsed electronic drivers to get the lamp to work (most likely, according to this reference in the Nature paper, you need to fine tune the gas mixture and the pressure and the driving electronics for the lamp which is far more complex than a simple driver for a fluorescent tube).

And, as for ""Nobody needs glass (or quartz) blowing of a lamp"", I'm afraid you are delusional. You need specialist glass to let the right wavelengths through and specialist filters to kill the harmful wavelengths. This is not ""simple DIY"".

You have seen an interesting paper in Nature and assumed it is easy for someone to make in their shed. This is not true. Specialist skills are required and attempting anything without those skills is likely highly dangerous (and that is ignoring the issues of handling the chemicals and vacuum technology needed to create the lamp: both are dangerous). 

And, perhaps more importantly, the best way to avoid contamination of others with covid-19 is to wash your hands. There are no easy technological silver bullets here, though, perhaps, professional engineers and chemists can build something safe based on the Nature observation in the future.
","Interesting and per your cited source, to quote:


  [...] far-UVC light generated by filtered excimer lamps emitting in the 207 to 222 nm wavelength range, efficiently inactivates drug-resistant bacteria, without apparent harm to exposed mammalian skin 13,14,15. 


Also, more details:


  Far-UVC lamps
  We used a bank of three excimer lamps containing a Kr-Cl gas mixture that predominantly emits at 222 nm 25,26. The exit window of each lamp was covered with a custom bandpass filter designed to remove all but the dominant emission wavelength as previously described 15. Each bandpass filter (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) had a center wavelength of 222 nm and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 25 nm and enables >20% transmission at 222 nm. 


This is a technical area and to be honest, this may not be the best forum on how to make a lamp with a Kr-Cl gas mixture with a custom bandpass filter.

I do get the feeling that they may be an associated patent application somewhere, that may provide more details. And, yes there is at least a patent pending upon performing a patent search.  To quote from the company's website:


  The New Columbia University Study again confirming the effectiveness and safety parameters of our patented wavelength (222nm) referred to by Columbia as Far-UVC.
  
  These results confirm studies that we have been doing for the last 12 years. We have patented 222nm for air, liquid and surface disinfection.
  
  Our patents cover all forms of skin and eye disinfection. We are in the process of getting FDA approval for a number of applications.
  
  We call this wavelength Far-UV Sterilray.

510,general,politics.stackexchange.com,"Romania has virtually the worst public health system in EU and there is no surprise that it is far from being prepared for tackling the coronavirus infection.

On major issue is that corruption (e.g. among hospital managers) has led to hospitals to not have the minimum equipment (masks, gloves) not even for a week or two. 

In this context lots of medical workers got infected and quite a lot decided to quit. The government wants to tackle this issue by either withdrawing their right to practice medicine or expanding their notice period.

Since Romania already has a significant medical staff deficit, the second option is more likely. Currently the law mentions a 20 working days period notice (~ 1 month), but the government is considering 60 working days (~ 3 months). Based on some epidemic spreading simulations this will cover the worst period of the epidemics. This means de facto forcing the medical staff to face the infection without proper equipment.

Working without proper equipment means a much higher chance of getting infected, infecting colleagues and patients.

There was a lot of debate over this issue and I am wondering if such measures are compatible with EU laws or the emergency sate can simply override some EU laws that have priority over national laws. 

Question: Can an EU country government force its medical doctors work with SARS-CoV2 infected patients without the proper equipment?

Note: Some equipment was indeed received very recently, a few weeks after the first coronavirus case was officially confirmed in Romania.
","The EU directives and regulations with respect to ""Workplaces, equipment, signs and personal protective equipment"" can be found here. The directive that I think is most relevant is Directive 89/656/EEC - use of personal protective equipment.

This directive sets minimum standards for PPE used by workers, and states the obligations that employers have on this matter:


  Personal protective equipment must be used when the risks cannot be
  avoided or sufficiently limited by technical means of collective
  protection or procedures of work organization.
  
  All personal protective equipment must:
  
  
  be appropriate for the risks involved, without itself leading to any increased risk
  correspond to existing conditions at the workplace
  take account of ergonomic requirements and the worker's state of health
  fit the wearer correctly after any necessary adjustment.
  
  
  The employer must provide the appropriate equipment free of charge and
  must ensure that it is in good working order and hygienic condition.


When defining what this directive covers, the following exceptions are noted:


  The definition in paragraph 1 excludes:
  
  (a) ordinary working clothes and uniforms not specifically designed to
  protect the safety and health of the worker;
  
  (b) equipment used by emergency and rescue services;
  
  (c) personal protective equipment worn or used by the military, the
  police and other public order agencies;
  
  (d) personal protective equipment for means of road transport;
  
  (e) sports equipment;
  
  (f) self-defence or deterrent equipment;
  
  (g) portable devices for detecting and signalling risks and nuisances.


None of these exceptions would seem to cover medical workers except the rather non-specific ""emergency and rescue services"". I would take that to mean paramedics, ambulance staff, and mountain rescue workers and the like, however it is possible that this clause could be used to exempt general medical workers from this protection.

Specifically in the case of Romania, this directive has been implemented in national law by ""Hotărâre privind cerinţele minime de securitate şi sănătate pentru utilizarea de către lucrători a echipamentelor individuale de protecţie la locul de muncă"", or ""Decision concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the use by workers of personal protective equipment at the workplace"". From my rudimentary translation of the law, this appears to be pretty much word for word a translation of the original directive.

At first glance then, it seems that failing to provide adequate PPE for hospital staff is a breach of the employer's obligations under this EU directive. However, there are a number of exceptions noted in the directive, not to mention exceptions in national law, which could be used to exclude hospital workers from the protection. In addition, a few national governments have not implemented the directive into national law yet. This makes it difficult to give a definitive answer before this is tested in the courts, as a Spanish doctor's union is attempting.
","Rent for new buildings isn't capped (at least not by this new law), so the cap shouldn't interfere with new buildings. Rent may also be increased up to a point when a building is modernized.

The cap was implemented because the market didn't work for a lot of people who needed to spend more and more of their income on rent or be driven out of Berlin. The market also failed to build an adequate amount of new housing before the cap (fewer housing than needed for new residents were build, and the city actually build 25% of new housing itself). Experience has also shown that the market reacts to new buildings not with lower, but with increased rent. And despite the high need for affordable apartments, there was a high amount of vacancy. Because of this, the cap was very popular among voters (over 70% approval).

506,general,politics.stackexchange.com,"It is widely considered that the passing of the corona virus bill in Hungary is a huge step towards dictatorship. (See, for example, here: https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-viktor-orban-rule-by-decree/)

The main argument is that:


The bill allows prime minister Orban to rule by decree infinitely (at least as long as he sees fit) and that
There is no real need for these measures even during the current COVID-19 pandemic.


But what remains is the question whether there is any need for such measures. From my view as a outsider, I can't really see any benefits concerning the fight against the pandemic. Fidesz already has a two-third majority in parliament, enabling it to rule mostly unhindered and is even  able to change the constitution if deemed necessary. Any (tough) measures could probably be passed easily by Fidesz without Orbán having to be able to rule by decree.

Of course, if someone would like to transform the country into a dictatorship, these measures would make a lot of sense. But are there other reasons that may justify the necessity of the bill?
","Well, one obvious justification is that it means the parliament does not have to assemble. 


It is difficult to organize a parliamentary debate while keeping social distancing.
What if some legislators get into contact with an infected person. Could they still speak and cast their vote, or would they be banned during the quarantine period?


Of course the parliament could e.g. have put a narrow expiry date on the rules, but who knows how feasible a session would be three or six months from now? An expiry of ""after the pandemic"" would be too fuzzy. 



My personal opinion is that the parliament should have found a way to stay relevant, but the question asked for possible justifications.

An option might have been to change parliamentary rules to reduce the quorum, possibly combined with pairing, or to allow online debates and voting, but those are difficult for democracy as well.
","WTO rules are much less favourable than the deal that the UK currently has with the EU. There would be mandatory tariffs in both directions, forcing up prices. The UK would lose things like EU certifications for aircraft and vehicles too.

WTO rules are designed to be a minimum level on which countries trade, only used in the absence of better deals.

There are also problems with the WTO rules themselves. For a start they require equal treatment for all countries operating under them, and given that the Irish border must remain open it's a problem for both the UK and EU. The EU would not want an open border with a WTO-rules country because it would be obliged to offer the same to all other WTO-rules countries, as would the UK. That threatens peace in Ireland and both economies.

Finally, it's not clear that the UK can actually trade on WTO rules as freely as some people claim. Other members have already lodged complaints over the UK's allocation of EU quotas, and in the event of a no-deal crash out would doubtless lodge more over the open border with Ireland. Disputes in the WTO take years to resolve and can be used as leverage to get trade deals less favourable to the UK.

265,expert,stats.stackexchange.com,"A big problem with the current COVID-19 epidemic is the difficulty of getting tested (due to mild symptoms and lack of testing kits). This makes it impossible for patients with little or no symptoms to know how likely it is to be infected and further spreading the disease. 

There are estimations available but only take into account confirmed cases (and range between 10x-1000x of this number). How could one get estimations of the number of patients by using secondary features of the distribution that could be more robust? Age-adjusted death rate under intensive care could be one of several such parameters.


","Death rate

Using death rate may work when people that die have most likely acquired the virus locally. 

However, for the moment, many people die because they acquired the virus during a visit to another area, or because they got it from another person that acquired the virus abroad. 

Thus this death-rate based number is not very accurate unless the virus has fully spread out (in which case it will be more likely to get infected from a local source). 

For the cases of Wuhan, Italy and other epi-centers, which have more spread due to local infections rather than foreign infections, death rate might be a good probe (although you still have to deal with the delay).

In addition, while death rate might be more thrustworthy than total cases of infection (just think about the Germans, with lots of supplies, are testing with a lot of thousands people, while neighboring countries, with limited supplies, are trying to limit the use of testing as much as possible), bit it is still a biased number. It is not easy to determine/pinpoint the cause of death. Often multitude of diseases are present. If a person with cancer or aids gets a pneumonia from nCoV-19, then what is the cause? The sampling of 'cause of death' is not very clear and becomes part of the analysis.

Statistics are only usefull for a comparison when they have a similar underlying basis. 

Travel data

The virus is mostly spreading out irregularly over a network. It spreads out differently at different scales, within the household, neighborhood, workplaces/schools, villages, agglomerations, countries, continents.  You can sort of see the virus spread around with sudden jumps from large node/community to large node/community. 

You can use occurrence of the virus in those nodes/communities as the variable (so you do not count individuals, since we do not know the presence in all individuals, but instead count the much better known presence of the virus in communities), and then use a model for the dynamics of the virus spreading between this different nodes in the network.

For instance. E.g. in region A you encounter x cases of disease among people that came from region B and y cases of disease among people that came from region C, while the travel to those regions is $r$ and $q$, then an estimate of the relative presence of the virus in regions B:C can be approximated by (x/r):(y/q).

I remember there was an early article on the spread of COVID-19 (I believe it was by Chinese scholars) that tried to estimate $R_0$ and included information about the frequency of travel between different regions.



Random tests

You can perform test on a sample from the population that does not show any symptoms and use the prevalence of the virus among this sample to make an estimate about the prevalence in the entire population.

If the prevalence is very small then this requires a very large sample which might be difficult. In that case one may perform the test among a sample where the suspicion of the prevalence is higher and gain some information about how many people have the virus in that group. Such a measure can be used to calibrate the estimates based on incomplete information (ie. along with other information, such as the rate at which people with the virus have the particular mild or severe symptoms, you get an idea about how much the current estimates are underestimating the true number of cases).
","I think this might be how to think of it :

Rewrite the concentration inequality as 

$$
\mathbb{P} \bigg( \lvert X - E[X] \rvert \geq t \sigma C_4^\frac{1}{4} \bigg) \leq \frac{1}{t^4}
$$

then

$$
\mathbb{P} \bigg( \lvert  X - E[X] \rvert \geq \eta^{-\frac{1}{4}} \sigma C_4^\frac{1}{4} \bigg) \leq \eta
$$

then if you removed the $\eta$-quantile, the remaining $1-\eta$ mass of points would lie within

$$

","death rate  using death rate may work when people that die have most likely acquired the virus locally.   however, for the moment, many people die because they acquired the virus during a visit to another area, or because they got it from another person that acquired the virus abroad.   thus this death-rate based number is not very accurate unless the virus has fully spread out  in which case it will be more likely to get infected from a local source .   for the cases of wuhan, italy and other epi-centers, which have more spread due to local infections rather than foreign infections, death rate might be a good probe  although you still have to deal with the delay .  in addition, while death rate might be more thrustworthy than total cases of infection  just think about the germans, with lots of supplies, are testing with a lot of thousands people, while neighboring countries, with limited supplies, are trying to limit the use of testing as much as possible , bit it is still a biased number. it is not easy to determine/pinpoint the cause of death. often multitude of diseases are present. if a person with cancer or aids gets a pneumonia from ncov-19, then what is the cause  the sampling of  cause of death  is not very clear and becomes part of the analysis.  statistics are only usefull for a comparison when they have a similar underlying basis.   travel data  the virus is mostly spreading out irregularly over a network. it spreads out differently at different scales, within the household, neighborhood, workplaces/schools, villages, agglomerations, countries, continents. you can sort of see the virus spread around with sudden jumps from large node/community to large node/community.   you can use occurrence of the virus in those nodes/communities as the variable  so you do not count individuals, since we do not know the presence in all individuals, but instead count the much better known presence of the virus in communities , and then use a model for the dynamics of the virus spreading between this different nodes in the network.  for instance. e.g. in region a you encounter x cases of disease among people that came from region b and y cases of disease among people that came from region c, while the travel to those regions is  r  and  q , then an estimate of the relative presence of the virus in regions b:c can be approximated by  x/r : y/q .  i remember there was an early article on the spread of covid-19  i believe it was by chinese scholars  that tried to estimate  r 0  and included information about the frequency of travel between different regions.    random tests  you can perform test on a sample from the population that does not show any symptoms and use the prevalence of the virus among this sample to make an estimate about the prevalence in the entire population.  if the prevalence is very small then this requires a very large sample which might be difficult. in that case one may perform the test among a sample where the suspicion of the prevalence is higher and gain some information about how many people have the virus in that group. such a measure can be used to calibrate the estimates based on incomplete information  ie. along with other information, such as the rate at which people with the virus have the particular mild or severe symptoms, you get an idea about how much the current estimates are underestimating the true number of cases .

","There are about 8 common strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in circulation.  It appears to be mutating slowly based on phylogenetic analyses and each mutation appears to be the same in terms of clinical disease and lethality.

So, there is no expectation that if you catch the disease late in its spread that the clinical disease is going to be any different from any other time that it's caught.


  Now, more diversity is emerging. Like all viruses, SARS-CoV-2 evolves over time through random mutations, only some of which are caught and corrected by the virus’s error correction machinery. Over the length of its 30,000-base-pair genome, SARS-CoV-2 accumulates an average of about one to two mutations per month, Rambaut says. “It’s about two to four times slower than the flu,” he says. Using these little changes, researchers can draw up phylogenetic trees, much like family trees. They can also make connections between different cases of COVID-19 and gauge whether there might be undetected spread of the virus.

","They may do so at some point if the risk is deemed high enough (remember that WHO still doesn’t consider this as a severe enough pandemic at the international level).

However:


Why would they ban flights from all over China, when a majority of the cases are concentrated in a much, much smaller area? Remember that China is quite large. It would be akin to banning travel from all of Europe after an outbreak in a single city.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, if you consider that the virus has reached many places outside of China, why only ban flights from China rather than any country where there may have been any cases?
Unless all countries coordinate to completely isolate China (or whatever area is considered “infected”), then people will just travel via a third country, so the ban will be ineffective.


The difficult task of the health authorities is to balance reducing the risk that the virus spreads all over while not infringing on the freedoms to travel. They are constantly re-evaluating the risks based on the available info regarding number of cases, incubation period, ease of transmission, mortality rate, etc. It may be the case that this virus, even though new, is just no worse than the flu.

Remember that a travel ban not only could be a problem in terms of freedoms and rights of the affected people (try telling US citizens they can’t return home – the US government would be taken to court before you finished reading this sentence), but it also has a strong impact on the economy, which itself may have severe health repercussions.

197,expert,law.stackexchange.com,"(First time posting on this SE, I hope it's not off-topic.)

I have a friend who lives in the Netherlands, let's call her Allison. Both her and her neighbor (let's call him Bob) live in an apartment complex owned by a therapy organization they are both patients at, and their landlord is also the owner of said organization. Bob has lived there longer than Allison.

Every once in a while (at least once a week, though sometimes a lot more often), Bob tends to be very noisy in his apartment, by listening to loud music or playing with a pinball machine (a physical, real life one, not a video game). This often also happens very late at night, which is obviously not allowed per contract, and the walls are incredibly thin. Allison has complained about this numerous times, as it prevents her from sleeping at night and her mental health is suffering because of it, which the therapy home was supposed to be helping with. The inhabitants of the other apartments don't hear any noise, as Allison's apartment is the only one that share's a wall with Bob's.

The problem: Since Bob is a therapy patient himself, the landlord and the therapists appear to be protective of him. Supposedly, he has his own baggage that prevents him from noticing, caring or remembering that he's being inconsiderate. While they don't explicitly condone him doing this at night, they barely take any direct action. Instead, they advised Allison to use earplugs, since the person who lived in her apartment before her never complained about this and they figured she may just be too sensitive. When the earplugs didn't help, they told her to message Bob whenever he's being too loud, because he apparently needs constant reminding that he's not supposed to do this after a certain time of day. Allison tried this, and it helped, but the silence usually only persists for a few minutes before being broken again.

On Allison's request, the landlord eventually agreed to order noise cancelling panels to be installed on the wall between their apartments. However, he only agreed to pay for the very cheapest ones available, which had to be shipped from China and are now being withheld due to the Corona virus. Furthermore, after it was clarified that these panels would need to be installed on Bob's side of the wall in order to have any effect, Bob suddenly expressed that he's not willing to put in the effort to do so. In other words, he refuses to actively do something to fix the problem he's causing, despite the panels being gifted to him (Allison has expressed willingness to invest into panels for her side of the wall out of her own pocket, just for added sound isolation, but as stated earlier, those won't do much on their own).

Recently, Allison's therapist started encouraging her to look for other apartments, all of which turned out to be substantially more expensive than her current one (given similar size and quality). Despite knowing that Allison's financial situation isn't the best, her therapist kept suggesting that it might be worth it to get some peaceful nights. Allison feels like this is rather unfair, like she's being punished for her neighbor breaking the contract and keeping her up at night, and that the landlord / therapy organization should put more effort into solving this for her, as the contract states that excessive noise at night is grounds for eviction. However, whenever she brings these arguments up, they keep getting dodged.

Allison tried contacting the police about this, but they dismissed her case as something that's out of their reach. They advised her to try something called a ""neighborhood mediation"", though Allison has strong doubts about the usefulness of such a thing, as the landlord and therapists have already tried mediating between the two of them.

Question: Is there any other way to resolve this issue? Can a therapy organization get away with catering to one patient's needs, despite that being extremely counterproductive to the needs of another patient, especially if the former is the one breaking the rules? Is it legal for the landlord to blatantly ignore a contract that was signed by all the involved parties and not take any action against one of these parties breaking it and strongly inconveniencing another one? And if not, how does one get him to take action?

  Can a therapy organization get away with catering to one patient's needs, despite that being extremely counterproductive to the needs of another patient, especially if the former is the one breaking the rules? Is it legal for the landlord to blatantly ignore a contract that was signed by all the involved parties and not take any action against one of these parties breaking it and strongly inconveniencing another one?


First, it is important for Allison to distinguish between the existing legal relations and each one's separate ramifications.

The therapist looks manipulative and dishonest when encouraging Allison to rent a more expensive place, since at this point it seems that the therapist knew or should have known that the situation involves the landlord (who coincidentally is the therapist's employer). At the very least, the therapist should have informed Allison that the therapist has a potential conflict of interest, and thus let Allison decide whether or not to rely on that organization's services. Here, the therapist failed to make due disclosure.

Instead, the therapist's acts have all the appearance of accommodating its other customer (Bob), and ultimately trying not to disrupt its employer's profits both as landlord and as therapy business owner. That conflict of interest sounds in therapist's malpractice and may even amount to [therapist's &amp; company's] fraud.

Regardless of whether Allison chooses to denounce the therapist and/or the business, she should ask herself whether a therapy organization with such practices is apt for continued treatment of --and the ensuing profits from-- Allison's therapy needs. One aspect Allison needs to consider is that her continued business there would weaken her arguments if she eventually brings court proceedings against the therapist or his employer.

Allison's tenancy is a separate issue. Allison knows better than I (and the public in general) the terms of her lease and the physical details of her residential unit, so only she can compare them with section 7.4.2 of the Burgerlijke Wetboek to assess whether the lack of quiet enjoyment is attributable to a defect of the leased property (article 7:204.2). Allison should assess this issue from the standpoint of landlord's possible allegation that """"the disturbance is caused by a third person"" (whereby the landlord would seek to avoid liability under 7:204.3). Depending on Allison's determination of the aforementioned issue, she would have a claim against the landlord for breach of contract, and/or against Bob for tortious conduct (6:162).

There are at least three reasons why Allison should follow the police's suggestion of neighborhood mediation. The first reason is that there has been essentially no mediation in Allison's dispute. Mediation requires a nonparty whose neutrality is not compromised when conducting the mediation. That has been missing here so far. Allison has only dealt with third parties (i.e., the landlord and therapists) who are first and foremost reluctant to inconvenience their noisy client Bob for fear of affecting their own business interests. Allison's belief that these people were conducting a form of mediation is mistaken.

The second reason is that, from mediation, Allison may pursue and obtain a written &amp; signed agreement whereby Bob promises to desist from his pattern of disturbances (ideally Allison would secure an akin sort of commitment also from the landlord). In the event that Allison subsequently needs to sue either or both of the parties for the continued disturbances, filing in court these binding documents (which she would have obtained through mediation) will ease Allison's burden of proof.

The third reason is that genuine mediation might obviate Allison's need to seek remedies in court. That is because it would teach both landlord and Bob that Allison is able and willing to take legal action if the situation persists or escalates, which might have a dissuading effect on them. Furthermore, mediation proceedings will give Allison some experience as to presenting her legal arguments in a more formal setting.

Courts in Netherlands may grant injunctive relief in situations like Allison's where the ongoing harm is not susceptible of being quantified in monetary terms. Allison may pursue that relief, which if granted would compel the police to enforce it each time Bob violates it.
","Arkansas does not appear to have its own version of the FMLA. Whether or not the FMLA applies to your friend's employer is a complex question related to other local businesses that may or may not be integrated with the franchise within which he works. It would require the knowledge of a local labor attorney and knowledge of the business structure of the franchisee to make a determination. 

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA - Department of Labor site) applies to employers with 50 or more employees within 75 miles of the employee's worksite.

Generally, franchise operations are independent businesses and the individual business would need to meet the employee count threshold for its employees to be covered.

However, there is the concept of an ""integrated employer."" The Labor Department sometimes groups smaller businesses as an integrated employer and this will cause the FMLA to apply to seemingly independent businesses with fewer than 50 employees.

The Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division lays out four factors to determine if the businesses are integrated:


  
  interrelation of operations, i.e., common offices, common record keeping, shared bank accounts and equipment;
  common management, common directors and boards;
  centralized control of labor relations and personnel, i.e., hire and fire employees; and,
  common ownership and financial control
  


They further state:


  A determination of whether or not separate entities are an integrated
  employer is not determined by the application of any single criterion,
  but rather the entire relationship is to be reviewed in its totality.
  All four criteria need not be present in all cases, but the Equal
  Employment Opportunity Commission, which administers the Civil Rights
  Act, considers the first three criteria to be the most important, with
  centralized control of labor relations to be most critical of these
  three.


A fast food franchise would not be subject to FMLA regulations because the franchisor is a large company. However, many fast food franchises are part of larger, local businesses such as restaurant groups that may be subject to the regulations.

An example of this would be Christopher Harold who owned Sofono, Inc, a company established to own three Domino's Pizza franchises. In Cousin v. Sofono, an employee sued to recognize that the FMLA applied to these businesses because they were an ""integrated employer."" There is an article in Business Management Daily that discusses the case and the appeal of the case can be found here.

Whether or not the fast food franchise where your friend works would qualify as an integrated employer with other fast food franchises is subject to an examination of the business structure of the individual employers. If the franchise is truly a stand-alone business with fewer than 50 employees then the FMLA would not apply. In the case of the Domino's pizza franchise they were deemed to be integrated because they were the same franchise licensees of the same franchisor (Domino's) and they had a common workers' comp policy.

Do be aware that the 50 employee limit is not a permanent employee threshold. From The Employer's Guide to The Family and Medical Leave Act:


  A private-sector employer is covered by the FMLA if it employs 50 or
  more employees in 20 or more workweeks in the current or previous
  calendar year.

(I am ignoring that last part)

So you suggest intelligence (the modern human brain) evolved solely as a sexual dimorohism which then migigated over time? 

I find that particular combination unlikely because intelligence would somehow need a sex-chromosome dependence which later was somehow lost. I don't think sexual dimorohism in intelligence can by seen in any mammals, and losing it again is unlikely as well. 

But I can't disprove your idea completely: It seems the brain specific expression pattern is quite different in males and females. Also some brain specific genes were found as additional copies on sex chromosomes.

With either of these 2 facts alone there is at least some miniscule potential that your hypothesis could be true! 

(So you can argue gene duplication to autosomal chromosomes or expression levels being influenced by sex chromosomes.) 

Ps: But it's equally (un-)probable that intelligence at first evolved in women only.

43,biomedical,biology.stackexchange.com,"Coronavirus, HIV, 1918 Flu, etc. They all come from animals. Do any infectious diseases (in humans) come from plants? More specifically, are there viruses that infect plants that can mutate to infect humans?
","Question


  “Are there viruses that infect plants that can mutate to infect
  humans?”


Answer

None appear to have been reported so far. It is difficult to provide supporting evidence for an assertion that they do not exist, but a recent review on the relationship between plant and animal viromes does not include any examples, and our general understanding of the mechanisms by which viruses infect organisms and cells suggest that this is unlikely. There are, however, examples of plant viruses replicating in the insect vectors that transmit them.

Evidence

In 2011 Dolja and Koonin of the NIH published a review in Current Opinion in Virology 1 322-331 entitled Common origins and host-dependent diversity of plant and animal viromes. In this they considered: 


  “…three distinct scenarios for the origin of related viruses of plants
  and animals: i) evolution from a common ancestral virus predating the
  divergence of plants and animals; ii) horizontal transfer of viruses,
  for example, through insect vectors; iii) parallel origin from related
  genetic elements.”


The very fact that there was a need to argue for a relationship indicates the assumed distinction between animal and plant viruses, and indeed they write:


  “…plants are not known to support reproduction of dsDNA viruses and
  retroviruses.”


The only reference in the whole article to an actual biological relationship between animal and plant viruses is the following:


  “Strikingly, viruses of the order Mononegavirales and the family
  Bunyaviridae… can also reproduce in their arthropod vectors.”


The paper referenced in support of this statement is by Hogenhout et al. and was published in the Annual Review of Phytophathology (2008) 46 327–359, and is entitled Insect Vector Interactions with Persistently Transmitted Viruses. From this it emerges that there is a class of plant viruses called persistent propogative viruses which replicate in the circulation of their insect vectors, in contrast to most types of circulative viruses. The insects involved include the leafhopper (illustrated below in Fig 1 from that review) and the thrip.



Schematic representation of persistent virus transmission by a leafhopper. Viruses that are transmitted in a circulative persistent manner do not replicate in the insect and usually enter the salivary glands from the hemolymph. In plants, replication of circulative viruses is frequently restricted to the phloem tissues. In contrast, most propagative viruses replicate in several plant tissues and in different organs of the insect vectors ( yellow arrows) and may enter the salivary glands either from the hemolymph or from other connecting tissues, e.g., the nervous system or trachea. 

It is not clear to me whether the virus is in any way detremental to the insect vector — certainly it is not the primary target of the virus, and replication can be regarded as allowing it to survive longer before the insect transmits it to the plant.

Today insects, tomorrow people?

The very fact that persistent propogative insect viruses can replicate in their animal vectors raises the question whether the insects could somehow transmit them to human beings. In an answer to a different question on whether insect pathogens can infect humans I have argued that the absence of examples in situations where people come into close contact with insects and the  difference in anatomy and molecular structure of cell membranes makes this unlikely. In the present case we are not even talking about an insect pathogen, but a plant pathogen.
","When you travel to different time zones, your circadian clock will be off (incorrect). The reason your circadian clock will be off is because your body has adapted to the time zone you are from. When you enter a new time zone, your circadian clock will still be functioning on the old the time zone. If the time zone difference is $\pm 12$ hours, this is a huge adjustment.

However, your body takes inputs from the environment. That is, you may see it is day light when your body is under the impression it is evening. Your circadian clock is controlled by your master clock located in the hypothalamus. As you take in these external inputs that counter your circadian clock, a group of nerve cells called the suprachiasmagic nucleus will slowly make the master clock adjustment [1]. This resetting can take a few days. 


NIH Jet Lag Prevention Guideline


Additionally, there has been a bit of research on exercise reducing jet lag. In a study, researchers test outdoor exercise with flight crew members and found that the group that exercised outdoors had a hastened re synchronization of their circadian clock [2].

Another interesting article is Jet Lag in Athletes.

423,general,politics.stackexchange.com,"President Trump speaking yesterday (Feb 26th 2020) gave an update about the response of the US to the novel coronavirus outbreak. In an announcement that introduced a new team to tackle the virus, Trump said that


  Because of all we've done (so far), the risk to the American people remains very low.


and that


  It is what it is. We're ready for it. We're really prepared. We have, as I said, we have the greatest people in the world. We're very ready for it. We hope it doesn't spread. There's a chance that it won't spread, too. And there's a chance that it will.


The president's remarks were then followed by Dr Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who reiterated the organisation's remarks of February 25th where the director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, said that:


  Ultimately, we expect we will see community spread in this country.


What measures, referred to by the President, have already been taken by the US government to prepare for the virus? Which of these have the Trump administration been responsible for? What is the purpose of the new team announced yesterday?
","Rather poorly one could say, with respect to testing. There's now outrage that the CDC has pursued its own flawed test kit under some version of NIH (which in this case stands for ""not invented here""), rather than adopt the one used by the WHO (and which was developed in Germany)...


  On Monday, following mounting criticism of the federal response, Trump administration officials promised a rapid expansion of the country’s testing capacities. With the help of private companies and academic centers, as many as a million diagnostic tests could be administered by the end of this week, said Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.
  
  But many scientists wonder if the moves come too late. [...] Most disturbing of all: Did a failure to provide adequate testing give the coronavirus time to gain a toehold in the United States?
  
  “Clearly, there have been problems with rolling out the test,” said Dr. Thomas Frieden, former director of the C.D.C. “There are a lot of frustrated doctors and patients and health departments.”
  
  Still, Dr. Frieden said he thought the situation was improving. Other experts, although supportive of the agency, were mystified that federal officials could have committed so many missteps.
  
  “The incompetence has really exceeded what anyone would expect with the C.D.C.,” said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at Harvard University. “This is not a difficult problem to solve in the world of viruses.”
  
  Officials at the C.D.C. did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The agency abruptly canceled a news conference on Monday just as it was to begin. Officials appeared to have removed figures on the agency website counting how many Americans had been tested.
  
  In February, the C.D.C. rolled out a three-step diagnostic test and distributed testing kits — each of which could run about 800 tests — to state and local health laboratories. But some of the components of the diagnostic kits were flawed, and produced inconclusive results.
  
  A three-step replacement was promised but never arrived; the agency has not fully explained why, except to say that there was a manufacturing defect. As a result, diagnostic testing was only conducted at the agency’s labs in Atlanta.
  
  The C.D.C. eventually rolled out a two-step replacement and permitted a few laboratories, where the kits had been working, to continue using their tests. But those with only one working component of the test still could not diagnose patients on their own.
  
  Getting results from the C.D.C. took days, however, and in any event the criteria for testing were strict — among them, the patient must have had recent travel to China or contact with someone known to be infected.
  
  Doctors nationwide complained of a bottleneck, both because of the restrictive test criteria and because of the agency’s limited testing capacity. The agency said it had the capacity to test about 400 specimens a day.
  
  The test criteria were “too stringent, and people aren’t getting tested,” said Lauren M. Sauer, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine.
  
  [...]
  
  “We have been really frustrated, because one of the things that is a hallmark of public health labs is that we are usually ‘ready, set, go,’ and here we were — ‘ready, set, wait’,” said Scott Becker, chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories.
  
  Late last week, the Food and Drug Administration broke the logjam, authorizing state and local laboratories to do initial testing on their own. If labs had developed and validated a test, they could use it for diagnosis instead of relying on the C.D.C.’s version or waiting for a replacement.
  
  Other nations have tested patients by tens of thousands. China has probably tested millions.
  
  “How come the South Koreans can do 10,000 tests a day and we can’t?” said Ralph Baric, who studies coronaviruses and emerging diseases at University of North Carolina.
  
  Soon after the virus surfaced in China, the C.D.C. got to work on its own test. “Generally, C.D.C. provides these tests for the world,” said Dr. Frieden.
  
  But German researchers were devising their own test, which was quickly adopted by the World Health Organization for distribution around the world.
  
  After the C.D.C.’s version turned out to be flawed, the agency continued to pursue it, despite the fact that another diagnostic test was already in wide use.
  
  With F.D.A. approval, the agency could simply have distributed the test used by the W.H.O. instead of creating a new one from scratch, Dr. Mina said. The government could do so even now.
  
  “It’s just a very American approach to say, ‘We’re the U.S., the major U.S. public health lab, and we’re going to not follow the leader,’” Dr. Mina said.

  Do individual countries control transit zone law? Or are they covered by international law, since they are international zones?


The former with a twist. Individual countries control transit zones on their territory, as in these are sovereign territory rather than international territory. They're just buffer zones where you keep visitors around until they've effectively crossed the border.

The twist is that, yes, there are international treaties that relate to them -- see e.g. the ones that relate to aviation law. Further, the laws that apply to them continue to evolve. See for instance this paper on Special International Zones, which are glorified mobile international transit zones.
","rather poorly one could say, with respect to testing. there is now outrage that the cdc has pursued its own flawed test kit under some version of nih  which in this case stands for  not invented here  , rather than adopt the one used by the who  and which was developed in germany ...    on monday, following mounting criticism of the federal response, trump administration officials promised a rapid expansion of the country is testing capacities. with the help of private companies and academic centers, as many as a million diagnostic tests could be administered by the end of this week, said dr. stephen hahn, commissioner of the food and drug administration.    but many scientists wonder if the moves come too late.  ...  most disturbing of all: did a failure to provide adequate testing give the coronavirus time to gain a toehold in the united states      clearly, there have been problems with rolling out the test,  said dr. thomas frieden, former director of the c.d.c.  there are a lot of frustrated doctors and patients and health departments.     still, dr. frieden said he thought the situation was improving. other experts, although supportive of the agency, were mystified that federal officials could have committed so many missteps.     the incompetence has really exceeded what anyone would expect with the c.d.c.,  said dr. michael mina, an epidemiologist at harvard university.  this is not a difficult problem to solve in the world of viruses.     officials at the c.d.c. did not respond to repeated requests for comment. the agency abruptly canceled a news conference on monday just as it was to begin. officials appeared to have removed figures on the agency website counting how many americans had been tested.    in february, the c.d.c. rolled out a three-step diagnostic test and distributed testing kits -- each of which could run about 800 tests -- to state and local health laboratories. but some of the components of the diagnostic kits were flawed, and produced inconclusive results.    a three-step replacement was promised but never arrived  the agency has not fully explained why, except to say that there was a manufacturing defect. as a result, diagnostic testing was only conducted at the agency is labs in atlanta.    the c.d.c. eventually rolled out a two-step replacement and permitted a few laboratories, where the kits had been working, to continue using their tests. but those with only one working component of the test still could not diagnose patients on their own.    getting results from the c.d.c. took days, however, and in any event the criteria for testing were strict -- among them, the patient must have had recent travel to china or contact with someone known to be infected.    doctors nationwide complained of a bottleneck, both because of the restrictive test criteria and because of the agency is limited testing capacity. the agency said it had the capacity to test about 400 specimens a day.    the test criteria were  too stringent, and people are not getting tested,  said lauren m. sauer, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at johns hopkins medicine.     ...      we have been really frustrated, because one of the things that is a hallmark of public health labs is that we are usually aready, set, go,  and here we were -- aready, set, wait ,  said scott becker, chief executive of the association of public health laboratories.    late last week, the food and drug administration broke the logjam, authorizing state and local laboratories to do initial testing on their own. if labs had developed and validated a test, they could use it for diagnosis instead of relying on the c.d.c. is version or waiting for a replacement.    other nations have tested patients by tens of thousands. china has probably tested millions.     how come the south koreans can do 10,000 tests a day and we can not   said ralph baric, who studies coronaviruses and emerging diseases at university of north carolina.    soon after the virus surfaced in china, the c.d.c. got to work on its own test.  generally, c.d.c. provides these tests for the world,  said dr. frieden.    but german researchers were devising their own test, which was quickly adopted by the world health organization for distribution around the world.    after the c.d.c. is version turned out to be flawed, the agency continued to pursue it, despite the fact that another diagnostic test was already in wide use.    with f.d.a. approval, the agency could simply have distributed the test used by the w.h.o. instead of creating a new one from scratch, dr. mina said. the government could do so even now.     it is just a very american approach to say,  we are the u.s., the major u.s. public health lab, and we are going to not follow the leader,   dr. mina said.

167,biomedical,health.stackexchange.com,"Reading numerous news articles about COVID-19, I got confused as to what is its main transmission route. In particular, I am confused as to whether it is


direct landing of respiratory droplets in mouths and noses, 
contaminated surfaces,
aerosols (i.e., suspensions of the virus in the air rather than respiratory droplets quickly landing in mouths or noses or on surfaces), or
something else.


On the one hand, the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that contaminated surfaces are not thought to be the main transmission route:


  It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. (Link)


The same website appears to suggest that the main transmission route is  direct landing of respiratory droplets in mouths and noses:


  The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
  
  
  Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
  Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
  
  
  These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.


On the other hand, the World Health Organization (WHO), like many other agencies, puts the main emphasis on washing hands. Here is the WHO's first and foremost piece of advice on how to prevent getting infected with the virus: 


  Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. (Link)


Social distancing is mentioned on that webpage only as a second piece of advice, and, furthermore, the webpage implies that it is safe to approach coughing people as close as 1 meter away:


  Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.


Furthermore, I found an article saying that the virus wasn't detected in the air of hospital rooms with COVID-19 patients, but was detected on surfaces: 


  When researchers in Singapore tested the air in the rooms of three Covid-19 patients, they found no virus particles on cleaned surfaces or in the air even when they took samples on days the patients were symptomatic and presumably shedding virus into the air, they reported this month in the Journal of the American Medical Association. In the room of the third patient, who shed more virus, virus particles were present on ventilation fans and numerous surfaces — but all air samples were negative. (Link)


But the same article also says that Chinese researchers found COVID-19 aerosols near patients' toilets.

My question: Actually what is the main way COVID-19 spreads?
","The confusion exists because there are conflicting pronouncements from various authoritative sources but also conflicting pronouncements from the same authority.

Covid-19 is a respiratory infection spread by droplets that can be aerosolized (nuclear droplets) in certain situations such as by flushing toilets or in certain medical procedures such as intubation. However, it reaches the air it contaminates surfaces and this allows for the infection to be caught through the eyes nose and mouth with the virus being transferred from the hand.

The data from Singapore and Taiwan show that handwashing and social distancing are successful in preventing disease transmission. However, if social distancing is not rigorously enforced then you will need to wear a mask. The head of the Chinese CDC, Dr George Gao, has recommended that everyone wear a mask which is advice that contradicts most countries health ministries. This is so that the infected are not shedding as many viral particles into the environment. His advice is based on the fact that there is a high degree of asymptomatic infection in the community and these people are spreading the virus by droplets just by talking and exhaling.  The contrary advice is because they feel users are wearing masks to protect themselves, and, in the absence of training, they are almost certainly less effective at providing protection.  But trained users have a similar degree of protection with both surgical masks and N95 masks.

So the main way of disease transmission is by respiratory droplet. But the fact that health workers, NYPD officers (currently over 500) and others are getting infected wearing masks points to surface contamination as the second main mode of infection, or, possibly lack of training in wearing the masks and/or poor hand washing, or, that aerosol transmission is indeed important.

","I get swollen lymph nodes all the time when I have a cold. If I push them, they kind of move back, and it hurts a little. When the cold clears up, they go back to normal.

In contrast, when the melanoma nobody knew I had metastasized to under my chin, the lump was entirely different from my swollen lymph nodes. Various medical people said ""it might just be a swollen node"" but I knew it was not. It was larger, didn't move when I pressed it, and for the first few months it didn't hurt, either. It took a long time to establish what it was, and during that time I was well aware that this was not your typical ""swollen nodes"" situation. If you can't feel any difference between a lump under your chin that you have now and one you had 6 months ago when you had a cold, that's because there probably is no difference. 

You can learn more about this at cancer.org but that doesn't really cover ""how can I tell if my swollen nodes are ok or not?"" because basically, swollen nodes are almost always ok. That's really what point 1 and 2 are about. If they've appeared when you know you have an infection, they are caused by the infection. If they go away within a week or so of the infection clearing up, they were caused by the infection. Nothing to worry about at all. Point 3 speaks to the physical differences, which to be fair you probably won't recognize until you've met a tumour, so isn't super useful in a consumer-focused list, and point 4 speaks to other cancer symptoms (nobody told me sweating was a symptom, I wish I had known that.) 

If I were giving medical advice around this it would be: ignore them until you feel you can't ignore them any longer. That's basically what I did. I think it's what most of us did. Don't be poking at your neck or armpits regularly to evaluate your lymph nodes. Most places no longer recommend monthly lump checks for breast cancer. This article mentions recommendations from Canadian sources, and I think much of that applies to trying to learn things from your own lymph nodes too.

351,general,photo.stackexchange.com,"I have been using a Nikon D5200 with a Tamron 100-400 zoom for wildlife photography. It's admittedly a budget setup (in some sense of the term ""budget""), so I don't expect amazing results. I'm also not a trained photographer, and I've pretty much learned by reading the internet and youtube (not ideal, I know). Recently, I decided to rent a different Nikon body for an expedition (which ultimately got canceled due to COVID-19).

I decided to rent a mirrorless Nikon Z6 to see how I would like a mirrorless camera, and to try a full-frame sensor, and also just to get a newer sensor and body and see how the quality compares, using the same Tamron lens.

I made a lot of mistakes in using the new body, but ultimately I'm stumped still. The photos are displaying the same annoying glow that I've seen with the old body. I don't know what is causing it, but it seems like I can narrow it down to ""operator"" or lens errors.



In the image above, a heavily cropped section of a photo of a bird, you can see the glow. It shows up similarly using either body. This is shot at 400mm, ISO 320 f/6.3, 1/500 sec. 

I handhold the camera most of the time because I just can't use a tripod for most of these photos (the birds are up in a tree, jumping around, etc.)

Does anyone have any suggestions for what I should do here? Should I use faster shutter speed and higher ISO? I've tried that and found that I get a lot of noise, but maybe the newer sensors can handle it? I'd be willing to spend some $$ on a book or read any references people might recommend. 

Thanks!

EDIT
This image is uncorrected, straight out of the camera, though (sadly) I took it as a JPG originally. I usually shoot raw, but had my settings incorrect for this new body that I'm renting. I see the same effect whether it's RAW or JPG though, it was just that this photo showed the effect more strongly so that I could illustrate my question.
","You appear to be using your lens (100-400/5-6.3) with the aperture wide open.  I would expect the glow in your photos to be significantly reduced or absent stopped down to about F8.

What about the 9,900 asymptomatic people who did no get tested?

Scenario A: All 9,900 asymptomatic people would test negative for COVID19.

Question:

Where are we right now between scenario A and scenario B? Or put another way, are there any ongoing studies/reports which take into account this factor?
","I think you're talking (setting aside false-positive/low-specificity testing problems for the moment) about the difference between infection fatality ratio (IFR, fraction of infected people who die from disease) and the case fatality ratio (CFR, fraction of clinically defined ""cases"" who die from disease). The difference between these two depends completely, as you suggest, on the difference between the population that gets infected and the population that is defined as a ""case"" (which could vary a lot: is it people who have a cough? fever &amp; cough? request testing? are admitted to the hospital? are admitted to the ICU?).

Because most of the people aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship were tested (3063/3711), we can have a reasonably good idea of the fraction infected (unlike the usual scenario where most asymptomatic cases are never noticed). The authors of this (not yet peer-reviewed) study concluded that:


  the all-age cIFR on the Diamond Princess was 1.2% (0.38–2.7%) and the cCFR was 2.3% (0.75–5.3%)


(where 'c' in cIFR and cCFR stands for 'corrected'; these are estimates that account for the fact that we don't yet know the outcome for all patients).

Other issues to think about:


sensitivity and specificity of testing (false positive/negative rates)
variation with/adjustment for age (discussed in the paper)
variation by medical/social context (e.g. Wuhan vs Iran vs places where cases are caught early and the medical infrastructure isn't overwhelmed)

So, if one is to avoid non-essential travel: What essential travel is allowed?

Things that come to mind:


Journalists going to where they want to investigate for a report.
Going to help isolated family members
Business meetings and factory visits, whether to establish policy or oversee measures that related to the COVID-19 or other task related to production.


Is any proper documentation needed to show that travel is essential? Or do we expect gate and border agents to evaluate on the spot based on your word?
","Some examples that I have seen in the media:


a healthcare worker who lives in Windsor, Canada and works in Detroit, USA. There are thousands of such people and they cross the border every day. They are doing so to deliver an essential service (healthcare) so their travel is essential
a truck driver pulling a load of food, medical supplies or other essential goods. While in theory the delivery company could have the truck handed off to a different driver at the border, more realistically the truck and driver will be allowed in as essential travel
a patient returning to their home city to keep an appointment for needed surgery. Most elective surgeries, dentist appointments and such are being cancelled, but a person could have been away just before their scheduled surgery
farm workers from Central America are going to be allowed in to Canada because our farms can't function without them


What is not essential?


tourism
business or work that does not serve an essential purpose (making a movie, looking for new restaurant locations to buy or rent in another city, negotiating a big purchase business-to-business of something non-essential like bathing suits or makeup)
people who feel they would be less likely to catch this if they went to their second home in the country
people who prefer the weather in Ontario to the weather in Alberta at this time of year


If I was going to do some essential travel I would bring whatever proof I could, and I would prepare for a significant wait while my explanation was evaluated. I am tempted to say, if you have to ask, it's not essential. I personally have cancelled a followup CAT scan and MRI scan required by a clinical study I am in. Everything's been stable for a while, so I'm not going to the big city. It doesn't feel essential to me.

Keep in mind that in many Canadian provinces, non-essential workplaces are closed, so where this image says ""work"" it means ""essential work"".

To clarify: if there are 10 000 viruses on average in an infected human and 100 000 humans are infected the answer would be (if all viruses are in humans, which probably isn't true) 10^4 x 10^5 = 10^9 viruses.

","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public: When and how to use masks


If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection.
Wear a mask if you are coughing or sneezing.
Masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
If you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly.


From : https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019

Protection measures for everyone
Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:


Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand
rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

","These are just my guesses as a system developer working with fraud detection.



Since the e-Gates are using the image (stored in the chip) in your passport, two people having faces looking almost the same and going through the gates so soon after each other should trigger a warning.

To solve this you could do plastic surgery or maybe use different flights so that the time between using the e-Gates is larger. I guess the timeout could be just 5 minutes.

You could also try wearing a hat, glasses or makeup.



I actually have the exact same image in both my passport and my EU National ID Card. If they were to be used within 5 minutes of each other, the 2nd should also be declined. But say I leave the country and then come back and use my other ID, I should be let in.

  In general, estimates suggest that 2% of the population are healthy carriers of a CoV and that these viruses are responsible for about 5% to 10% of acute respiratory infections.[3]
  
  Common human CoVs: HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 (betaCoVs of the A lineage); HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 (alphaCoVs). They can cause common colds and self-limiting upper respiratory infections in immunocompetent individuals. In immunocompromised subjects and the elderly, lower respiratory tract infections can occur.
  
  Other human CoVs: SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV (betaCoVs of the B and C lineage, respectively). These cause epidemics with variable clinical severity featuring respiratory and extra-respiratory manifestations. Concerning SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, the mortality rates are up to 10% and 35%, respectively.


Furthermore, the fact that there have been no or near no deaths amongst children raises the speculative possibility that previous exposure might make the illness worse since children have fewer years of exposure to seasonal coronaviruses.

","You are searching for the false-negative rate of these tests. A test resulting in a negative outcome while it should have been a positive outcome.

While I cannot find the original article I've got this information from, I've added two other relevant quotes. So yes false-negatives are possible but are likely caused by samples that are not properly collected.


  The rollout of COVID-19 testing is accelerating as more kits become available. However, a leading pathologist who was director of virology at Stanford, points out that the results are not 100% accurate. ""It's not that these tests can't detect virus,"" said Dr. Bruce Patterson. ""My concern is that the sampling involved in detecting the virus can lead to clinical false negatives."" - https://abc7news.com/6053940/


Also, the false-negative rate can vary based on the test method used and its quality and accuracy.


  COVID-19 tests are new, and assessing their accuracy is challenging. PCR tests may produce false negatives, failing to identify evidence of SARS-CoV-2. Sometimes false negatives result from human error or problems with the procedure. Giving the test too early or late, for example, can lead to a false negative. - https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-testing#accuracy

Sodium nitrite and potassium nitrite (salts) are added to cured and processed meats as reducing agent (opposite of oxidation agent) to delay spoilage and pathogenic bacteria growth and to preserve its color.

Historically nitrite and nitrate were considered harmful food additives where they were considered carcinogenic, however recent research has change our ideas about health effects of both nitrite and nitrate and newly studies show no association between its intake and stomach or ovarian cancer. Further more, they're now considered as essential nutrients for cardiovascular health by promoting nitric oxide (NO) production.2010, 2012

However under certain conditions, nitrite can form nitrosamines, molecules that cause cancer in lab animals. This happens when nitrites are exposed to high heat during cooking or strongly acidic conditions (stomach acids), they could form carcinogenic nitrosamines2006, 2007, wiki. As the result the U.S. Department of Agriculture established the safety limits on the amount of nitrites used in meat products in order to decrease cancer risk in the population. This could indicate that nitrosamines may be carcinogenic in humans.

Although available evidence supports a positive association between nitrite and nitrosamine intake and gastric cancer (GC) and oesophageal cancer (OC), they're not conclusive2006, wiki.

The recent research suggests that nitrite preservatives have ""been found to be safe""2012. However it doesn't mean processed meats are healthy.

  On the day before the airing of the final episode of School Days in Japan, a 16 year old girl killed her father with an axe in Kyoto. Due to an extremely similar scene present in the episode and to avoid relation to the axe murder, TV Kanagawa replaced it with a half hour of unrelated scenery with “Air on a G String” playing in the background. Among the shock and rage expressed among fans, a 4chan user commented “Nice Boat”, referring to the Norwegian ferry shown in the replacement footage. Immediately the phrase became a meme, however is far more popular in Japan than in English speaking countries.




The part with the boat is easily viewable on Youtube and other sites, but I haven't been able to find the full episode.

Is the episode bundled together with any merchandise or available legally online to stream/download?
","The full 28-minute version of Nice Boat is apparently available on Nicovideo (you'll need to make an account or use a redirector like nicoviewer). I didn't see the original Nice Boat back when it aired, so I can't say whether it's the real deal, but it certainly looks right to me. The Nice Boat itself makes its first appearance at 04:36. 

I would be surprised if Nice Boat were ever included in a home video release of School Days, though. At minimum, it's not included in the French DVD boxset or in the 2013 Japanese Blu-ray boxset.
","The Sharingan and Mangekyou Sharingan are caused by a special kind of ocular chakra originating in an Uchiha's brain. Usually, a cause of powerful emotion will awaken the Sharingan, and great loss will evolve it into the Mangekyou. Once unlocked, activating them is fairly easy. They can be transplanted, and even retain their abilities. Though it may have been an exception due to its spacetime powers, Kakashi's case showed it could even evolve to the Mangekyou despite not being in an Uchiha. Kakashi could activate and deactivate the Mangekyou form. However, he could never deactivate the Sharingan, and hence had to cover up his Sharingan eye when not in use to preserve chakra.

Next, after Obitos's death, he used his space time powers to transfer his chakra to Kakashi. By doing so, he also transfered his ocular chakra, which temporarily awakened Obito's Mangekyou in Kakashi. Once that Chakra was used up and the Sharingan released, it was gone for good.

Lastly, there is one who went through a very similar situation, Madara. As pointed out, Madara at one time had Obito's Mangekyou and his own Rinnegan. By having a 2nd eye, despite having unlocked the Rinnegan, did not evolve it into a Rinnegan. He even transplanted regular Sharingan before his death, but they did not evolve into Rinnegan either, despite up to several years between him giving his Rinnegan to Nagato, transplanting the spare Sharingan and dying.

Now, of course those were not Madara's real eyes, but the fact that he had the ocular chakra required to awaken even the Rinnegan, but couldn't do so with a Sharingan and a Mangekyou eye says a lot.

With all that established, We have a decent amount of evidence backing up what would happen if Naruto grew a new eye for Obito. Most likely, what would happen is the new eye would be a normal Uchiha eye, which is almost identical to any other regular eye. It would have the potential to unlock the Sharingan and Mangekyou Sharingan, and Obito could probably more easily unlock them than normal, but its impossible to say if it would happen immediately, take months to do so, or anywhere in between.

So, transplanting Obito's left eye into Kakashi, and then having Naruto regrow Obitos eye would likely be able to create 2 eyes with Obito's Mangekyou powers, given an unknown amount of time before he could reawaken his powers.

That however shows the main reason why they didn't do so, besides the situation preventing them from thinking about it. They couldn't risk it not working instantly. Obito was under Zetsus control until Kaguya showed up, and they needed everything they had to just barely pull off that victory. Obito having his left eye's powers is what both got Sasuke out of the dimension Kaguya threw him into alone, and saved Kakashi from her All-Killing Ash Bones. The odds that his new left eye being fully awakened to Mangekyou within the few minutes before it was needed are slim to none. Then after it was used twice in critical circumstances, he turned to ash.

13,biomedical,biology.stackexchange.com,"(Not sure if this is the right SE for this question. I'm asking this here, because I'm looking for a biological answer, if one exists.)

This (potentially very naive) question is inspired by this news article: Bats for sale at Indonesia's wildlife market despite virus warning


  Bats, rats and snakes are still being sold at an Indonesian market known for its wildlife offerings, despite a government request to take them off the menu over fears of a link to the deadly coronavirus.


Why would the government request to take the meat of these animals off the market? Even if they're linked to the coronavirus, the virus presumably can be killed by cooking the meat prior to consumption. After all, protein denatures well before 100 degrees celsius, and once it denatures the organism should die. Conceivably the virus could affect the handlers of these animals prior to their being cooked, but not the consumers.

Some paragraphs later in the article illustrate my confusion:


  Restaurateur Lince Rengkuan -- who serves bats including their heads and wings stewed in coconut milk and spices -- says the secret is preparation.
  
  ""If you don't cook the bat well then of course it can be dangerous,"" she said.
  
  ""We cook it thoroughly and so far the number of customers hasn't gone down at all.""


Which is effectively what I've been thinking, but:


  ""We're also urging people not to consume meat from animals suspected to be carriers of a fatal disease,"" said Ruddy Lengkong, head of the area's government trade and industry agency.


How are these two seemingly-contradictory positions reconciled?
","Restaurateur Lince Rengkuan is correct - once the bat meat is cooked the coronavirus will die, and the meat is safe to consume.

The Indonesian government isn't imposing restrictions for biological reasons, but for other reasons; these other reasons are out of scope of this SE.
","The answer is incomplete dominance.

It can't be codominance, because codiminance involves both phenotypes being expressed in different parts of the organism: you would end up with red and yellow spotted flowers.

It obviously isn't complete dominance, because the red x yellow cross produces orange flowers.

Knowing that it has to be incomplete dominance or multiple alleles, we can examine what we would expect to see in either of these cases.

Multiple alleles

In the case of multiple alleles, each individual plant has two alleles out of a possible three. These alleles will also express some sort of dominance pattern over each other. Let's say, hypothetically, that the dominance pattern goes Red > Orange > Yellow. 

In this case, all of the yellow flowers would have a genotype of yellow/yellow. The orange flowers could be orange/yellow or orange/orange. Red flowers can be red/orange, red/yellow, or red/red. When performing the crosses between red and yellow, you would then expect some mixture of offspring, probably mostly red. If the dominance pattern was different, you would still expect to see some mixture of offspring. But instead we see only orange offspring.

Incomplete dominance

In this scenario, homozygote red individuals have a red phenotype, homozygote yellow individuals have a yellow phenotype, and heterozygous individuals have the mixed orange phenotype.

In this scenario, you would expect red x red to produce only red offspring, and the same goes for yellow x yellow, because both parents have to be homozygous. Orange x orange would produce offspring in a genotype ratio of 1:2:1, as is the case when you self-cross heterozygous organisms. Orange x red and orange x yellow will produce offspring in a 1:1 genotype ratio, as is the case when you cross a heterozygote with a homozygote. These are exactly the patterns we see, so we can conclude that the answer is incomplete dominance.

","There are some theories that the COVID-19 outbreak started in hospitals (VOX, March 13, 2020):


  Another theory is that intense spread of the virus in the hospital
  system, before doctors realized there was a problem, may have
  amplified the outbreak. Some 10 percent of medical workers in Lombardy
  have been infected, according to a March 3 Washington Post report, and
  health workers account for 5 percent of those infected in the country.


In hospitals, in general, there are more older people.

There were also several cases of quick spread of infection in nursing homes.

Hospitals and nursing homes are environments where people live close together, so this is why infection can spread quickly among older people.

","projects for broad-based antibody blood tests are currently springing up like mushrooms. but the first test series available will be needed for the staff of health care.  of course there are other interests for antibody tests: virological, epidemiological and as your question implies economical.   antibody blood tests should provide information about the spread of the corona virus so that the measures taken by the authorities can be adapted. a nationwide initiative is now putting pressure.  http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/new-blood-tests-antibodies-could-show-true-scale-coronavirus-pandemic  for example, if a selected group of people were tested for sars-cov-2 antibodies every two weeks, the course of the epidemic would be clearly visible.  the interest, especially in business circles, is huge. everyone urgently wanted to know where they were in the pandemic, who was at best already immune and could therefore probably move around and work safely again.   http://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/coronavirus-antikoerper-tests-ein-schweizweites-projekt-wird-aufgegleist  such data could inform practical issues such as whether and how to reopen schools that have been closed. relatively few cases have been diagnosed among children, but it is not clear whether that is because they do not get infected or because their infections are generally so mild that they go unnoticed. testing children for sars-cov-2 antibodies should resolve that.  http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/new-blood-tests-antibodies-could-show-true-scale-coronavirus-pandemic  authorities are still afraid of a roll back of the wave when people start moving freely again. it must have a great acceptance and also be respected by those who should still stay at home.

172,biomedical,health.stackexchange.com,"There are four drugs being tested for effectiveness against COVID-19 in the SOLIDARITY trial.  Three of them have obvious potential mechanisms of action:


Remdesivir is an RNA polymerase inhibitor.  It might stop the virus from multiplying once it infects a cell.
Hydroxychloroquine may interfere with the spike protein the virus uses to attach to cells.
Interferon beta has general antiviral effects.


But I can't find anything that would explain why the Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination is expected to do anything.  Both drugs appear to be protease inhibitors that are fairly specific to HIV, while SARS-CoV-2 isn't even in the same general group of viruses as HIV.
","The NEJM editorial that accompanied that issue says:


  One antiviral-drug candidate is a combination of the HIV protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir. Lopinavir, which acts against the viral 3CL protease, has modest antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.


A quick search shows that SARS-CoV 3CL protease was the topic of some more in-depth investigations, including a theoretical Thai study of how of lopinavir might act on the 3CLpro of SARS:


  it was found that a mixture of two HIV-1 proteinase inhibitors, lopinavir and ritonavir, exhibited some signs of effectiveness against the SARS virus. To understand the fine details of the molecular interactions between these proteinase inhibitors and the SARS virus via complexation, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for the SARS-CoV 3CLpro free enzyme (free SARS) and its complexes with lopinavir (SARS–LPV) and ritonavir (SARS–RTV). The results show that flap closing was clearly observed when the inhibitors bind to the active site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. 
  
  [From:] Nukoolkarn et al. ""Molecular dynamic simulations analysis of ritronavir and lopinavir as SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors"" J Theor Biol. 


It's ""above my pay grade"" to comment whether that makes any sense or not as a practical approach to SARS (or Covid-19) medication, but the paper  notes that lopinavir has a similar effect on the HIV protease:


  Similarly, this kind of flap (loop) closing was also observed when inhibitors bind in the active site of HIV-1 protease (Hornak et al., 2006a, Hornak et al., 2006b).


As noted on Protopedia


  Drugs that inhibit HIV protease prevent the virus from replicating, and are crucial components of anti-HIV therapies.
  
  The proteolytic active site of HIV protease is covered by two ""flaps"". It is believed that these flaps must open to enable substrate polyprotein to enter the active site. Drugs that inhibit HIV protease tend to ""lock"" the flaps closed.


So I think they were/are hoping that 3CL plays a similarly vital role for SARS and Covid-19 virus replications, and so that drugs that close it will inhibit virus replication.

There seem to be other researchers who have considered this approach for the SARS-CoVs, so perhaps it has some merit:


  One promising approach is to develop small molecule inhibitors of the essential major polyprotein processing protease 3Clpro. Here we report a complete description of the tetrapeptide substrate specificity of 3Clpro using fully degenerate peptide libraries consisting of all 160,000 possible naturally occurring tetrapeptides. 


There's even a library-compound-search paper like that (i.e. trying to find molecules that would inhibit its 3CL) for SARS-CoV-2 out already (published March 26) by Chinese and Saudi researchers:


  The viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) enzyme controls coronavirus replication and is essential for its life cycle. 3CLpro is a proven drug discovery target in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Recent studies revealed that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that of SARS-CoV. Therefore, herein, we analysed the 3CLpro sequence, constructed its 3D homology model, and screened it against a medicinal plant library containing 32,297 potential anti-viral phytochemicals/traditional Chinese medicinal compounds. Our analyses revealed that the top nine hits might serve as potential anti- SARS-CoV-2 lead molecules for further optimisation and drug development process to combat COVID-19.


However, this latter paper also notes that there are some key differences between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 3CL proteases, so compounds that work against one might not be so effective against the other:


  results revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro receptor-binding pocket conformation resembles that of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro binding pocket and raises the possibility that inhibitors intended for SARS-CoV 3CLpro may also inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.
  
  To test this hypothesis, we docked (R)-N-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-N-(2-(tert-butylamino)-2-oxo-1-(pyridin-3-yl)ethyl)furan-2-carboxamide), a potential noncovalent inhibitor of SARS-CoV 3CLpro named ML188 [35], with the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro homology model. We also docked ML188 with the SARS-CoV 3CLpro structure (PDB ID: 3M3V) as a reference, and ML188 bound strongly to the receptor binding site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The inhibitor targets the Cys-His catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) along with the other residues, and the docking score (S = −12.27) was relatively high. However, surprisingly, ML188 did not show significant binding to the catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) of SARS-CoV-2, and the docking score (S = −8.31) was considerably lower (Fig. S3). 


This paper also investigated (in the theoretical/computational sense) three other drugs of that kind that might work on the SARS-CoV-2 3CL: Nelfinavir, Prulifloxacin and Colistin. Nelfinavir is also a protease inhibitor used to treat HIV-1 and Wikipedia says it's also being investigated for COVID-19, but I haven't checked the details. Interestingly perhaps, lopinavir is not mentioned at all in this SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor screening study. I couldn't tell you exactly why, but it might be because there are at least six ""1st gen"" protease inhibitors used in HIV treatment (and some ""2nd gen"" ones) so they probably just picked one for this study as representative.
","Dental flossing, essentially is done to maintain periodontal health, in hard to reach areas. Areas which are not used to any ""friction"" so, they will react in a rather singular manner in comparison to our exposed gums, per say. Thus, providing you presently have good oral health i.e. you don't have gingivitis which causes bleeding of the gums amidst brushing. 

Initially, flossing will cause inflammation and minor bleeding however, if the bleeding is rather severe it could indicate a periodontal disease and require medical intervention. Gums, if they are ""virgins"" to interdental flossing scene, will be tender, and this is common amongst nearly all whom who haven't flossed. So, despite your concern, they will become more firm once the plaque has been plausibly removed. As your gums become less tender, they will hence become less sensitive and no longer bleed as you floss. 

Albeit, if the bleeding still prevails after a period of a week, it would be advised to either, refresh your knowledge on how to floss, or pay a visit to your dentist. The latter could conclude that, you are incorrectly flossing e.g. too much pressure and rigor. 

It's difficult to judge when you'll become apparent of the benefits since, the greatest improvements will initially happen beyond your eye's magnification. This study may cure your curiosity, though.

I would assume that mutations happen at a single virion-cell level because there are differences in e.g. nucleotides in RNA  between:


the virion infecting a cell (e.g. ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2)
the released virions from that same single cell


If so, wouldn't one argue that:


replication errors (at the nucleotide and thus released virion level) can easily happen, potentially billions of times during the infection of a single host organism
there is no ""single successful"" mutation or RNA variant within a host, rather, we have a distribution of RNAs, many of which could be simultaneously transmitted to another host organism?


Further context

I quote from e.g. this paper:


  On a per-site level, DNA viruses typically have mutation rates on the order of 10E-8 to 10E-6 substitutions per nucleotide site per cell infection (s/n/c). RNA viruses, however, have higher mutation rates that range between 10E−6 and 10E−4 s/n/c


Again, wouldn't that mean that a single host could 1) easily generate many mutations of the same virus and 2) pass most of those uniquely generated mutations to another host? If so, how come we can simply say ""24 mutations (over time) per year""? 
","Since no one else has done so, just gonna expand on what occurred here in the comments (mostly from @Alex Reynolds):

tl;dr: natural selection exists.

Longer version:


Mutations/replication errors/whatever will happen in the creation of new virus particles within a host cell. There is some distribution of number of mutational events that will occur as a function of the number of new RNA molecules created per cell and the replication error rate. Some subset of these RNA molecules will be packaged into new particles, yielding a new generation of viruses that get a chance to infect. Yes, this is potentially a large number of new mutations per infection event.
Some large proportion of these new particles will contain non-functional RNAs, due to inactivating mutations of one kind or another. Most of the new mutations will be worse at being a virus than the originally infecting virus (their immediate parent). So therefore, they will be outcompeted by non-mutated forms.
Among all those viruses which continue successfully infecting throughout the course of a year, on average we observe 24 substitution mutations in the genome over the course of that year. Every transmission chain included in the group of viruses at the end of the year must have remained viable for infection of hosts. In other words, it has survived natural selection.


In population genetics, this phenomenon is known as ""mutation-selection balance""- e.g. new mutations arise in the population at a rate that is limited by the action of natural selection (at equilibrium).

Genotype-phenotype maps

What of course I am leaving unstated is exactly why ""...new mutations will be worse at being a virus than the originally infecting virus...""

This is very hard to predict in many cases. In some cases it is very obvious why a mutant is bad at being a virus, if e.g. an essential gene is deleted from the RNA genome. But for many single mutations we don't really understand what their effect will be on virus function, we just observe that they drop out of the population due to negative selection. 

If you are interested in this question, I recommend looking into genotype-phenotype maps. I know Jesse Bloom has done some work on influenza in this field, here is one example of such a paper. It is generally extremely laborious to do this kind of work, so relatively little is known about the functional effect of any specific mutation in any specific genome.

Hope it is helpful to have all that written out.
","It depends on the kind of antibiotic. Some antibiotic are bacteriostatic  i.e. they primarily stop the growth while some are bactericidal i.e. they kill the living bacterial cells. Some antibiotics can have mixed effects. Bacteriostatic antibiotics would not be very efficient in eliminating a colony.

Apart from the mechanism of action, there can be other factors that would dictate the efficacy of the antibiotic; these can all be considered under pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics:


Degradation/clearance rate of antibiotic
Rate of diffusion of antibiotic inside the bacterial colony (this rate would be less when the cells are inside a big colony compared to when they are disperse).
Community organization and dynamics inside the colony (like user137 said in their comment, certain biofilms can be more resistant to antibiotics)

I have recently saw a Romanian economist speaking about this issue and I was wondering how US and EU are dealing with this.

The European Central Bank decided to buy €750 billion worth of bonds while the US is considering printing more dollars (my emphasis).


  The extraordinary actions of the Federal Reserve on Monday morning can be boiled down to two sentences: There is a rapidly developing shortage of dollars across the economy. And the Fed will do anything it needs to, on any scale imaginable, to end this shortage.
  
  Its announcement was phrased in the dry bureaucratese typical of statements from a central bank. But it contains a powerful idea. The Fed, the one entity in the world with the power to create dollars out of thin air, has every intention of doing so at whatever magnitude is necessary to try to reduce the severity and limit the duration of the coronavirus economic crisis.


I am wondering why the Fed can print dollars while ECB cannot print Euros. Especially considering the ""desperate times"" of the new SARS.

Question: Can the European Central Bank ""print money"" to partially mitigate the economical effects of the coronavirus infection spreading?
","The Fed is the central bank of the United States, which is one nation despite the plural form in their name. 

The ECB is the central bank of some (but not all) EU nations, and their operation is based on an international treaty. What the ECB can and cannot do is spelled out in that treaty, and the member states could always modify the treaty if they consider that appropriate.


The ECB can effectively print money by buying Eurozone government debt. 
When the ECB was set up, the public in certain nations (notably Germany) was worried that the ECB would do that and tried to put safeguards into place.

","It's true there is a clause stating extradition from Hong Kong to China cannot be based on political motives. However, there are worries the Chinese government would fabricate charges just to get dissidents over to China, as they have done or tried to do before.

266,expert,stats.stackexchange.com,"This is a strange case of difference in fatality rate between Chinese and Italian covid-19 outbreak.

In my knowledge, fatality rate is a ratio between deaths from a certain disease compared to the total number of subjects diagnosed with the disease.

Starting from this assumption, I attempted to analyze difference in fatality rate between Chinese/Italian outbreak. Herein, I propose a reproducible R example for exploring this variable:

# Import dataset from authoritative source:  
# https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data
covid &lt;- read.csv(""https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/full_data.csv"")

# Subsetting only data from China and Italy
dataset &lt;- subset(covid, location == ""China"" | location == ""Italy"")

# Fatality ratio: is the proportion of deaths from a certain disease compared to the 
# total number of people diagnosed with the disease for a certain period of time.
dataset$fatality &lt;- round(dataset$total_deaths/dataset$total_cases*100, 2)

# Generating plot

ggplot(dataset, aes(as.numeric(date), fatality, color = location, group = location))+
  geom_smooth(size= .5, alpha=.25, color = ""gray65"")+

  scale_fill_brewer(palette = ""Set1"")+
  theme_light(14)



From this basis, I'm a little bit confused about such difference in terms of fatality rate between the two analyzed countries. In fact, China has the maximum fatality rate at 4%, while Italy at more than 6%. For this reason I've two questions:

1) Is my computation correct?

2) If yes, why such a huge difference in terms of fatality rate? 



EDT II

I would like to improve this question reporting a recent Science paper which can partially explain these differences. In fact, Li et al reported that for each COVID+ patient, other 5-10 are undocumented COVID+ leading to missleading fatality rate. Moreover, as reported in the comments, to date, there are no univocal diagnostic methods wordwide.
However, Italy is experiencing a huge increment in daily cumulative deaths compered to China:

Something is happening there! Hubei province is almost similar to Italy in terms of surface and population but very different in terms of population mean age since Italy is one of the oldest EU country.
","Reason 1 something technical about the computation.

Dying occurs with some delay to getting sick. As a consequence the ratio of people that got sick and the people that have died, is not equal to the ratio of people that will die.

(Still, if the number of sick cases and death cases both grow exponentially with the same factor then you might still expect this number to remain constant, but keep in mind that the growth is not exponential and that it is only a simplified model)



Reason 2 something important about the data acquisition

You might say, ok then let's compare the number of death cases with the number of sick several days ago (according to the average number that it takes between getting sick and dying).

But, the most important reason why the death rate based on these statistics is not constant and not comparible is because those numbers are only the reported cases and those may be a lot less than the real cases. So you are not computing a real death rate.

The statistic (reported/confirmed cases) is not what you think that it is (number of cases). This is especially clear in the curve of cases for China which has a bump because the number of cases rapidly increased after the defenitions were changed (from positively tested people to people with clinical symptoms)
","Note in your wikipedia definition of case fatality rate, you NEED to know the eventual outcome of all individuals infected with disease. As they note, of the 100, 9 die, and 91 recover, they do not live with infection. Your data do not show the number who recovered from disease. If the lag between confirmed case and death is long, you underestimated CFR. CFR can also be biased by the number of unconfirmed cases who die from disease and are confirmed as cases based on cause of death.

593,general,travel.stackexchange.com,"As part of my job, I helped my university to buy
an airline ticket for a student from city A to city B.
Due to the COVID-19 disease outbreak,
the student decided that it was too risky to travel,
and so he/she will remain in city A.

I noticed the following text in the electronic ticket:


  TICKET IS NON-REFUNDABLE
  
  NO SHOW PENALTY AT USD 250 PER TICKET


Questions:


Will my university or the student have to pay a no-show penalty
if he/she does not show up for the flight?
Should I take the effort to cancel the tickets with the airline?

Since the tickets are non-refundable,
I am assuming that my university will not get any money back for cancelling the tickets,
so there does not seem to be any benefit to us for cancelling the tickets.


(Note: city B is not yet a super high risk destination for COVID-19,
so I don't foresee the airline allowing a full refund for the airline tickets.)



I explain what I decided to do in the answer below.
","Non-refundable doesn't mean what you seem to assume - it does not mean that the money is lost. It means that you don't get it back.

That might seem an irrelevant difference, but often it is not - you can use the value of the ticket for further bookings with the airline (for the same flier, not just anybody).
If you cancel the ticket, you typically have 365 days (from day of payment, not day of flight) to use the value for another booking.

The no-show fee is a fee that gets taken out of your remaining value - if the flier simply doesn't show up (instead of cancelling), he will not get the full ticket value parked, but it will be reduced by the no-show fee.
So you should definitely cancel, as it will save the no-show fee. Only if the person is not going to fly within a full year is the ticket value completely lost.
","I think the key word in your initial statement is that you heard about it.  The fact that this occurred was deemed serious enough that it made it to the international news outlets.  Now, of course, that's not to say that every such incident makes the news, but it does mean that such incidents are obviously rare or there would be more than very occasional such incidents being reported.

Unfortunately discrimination can and does occur on airlines, just like it occurs in most parts of the world - but the odds of it escalating to the point of you being kicked off the plane or your wife being forced to remove her headscarf would be so low as to be considered zero on most airlines and in most countries around the world.

Specific to your wife's head covering, there are situations where she could be asked to remove it, but this should be done in a private area.  For example, here are the USA's TSA comments on head coverings.

As far as what you can do to minimize the chances of an incident, the only advice I could give would be the same that I'd give to any passenger, regardless of race or religion - consider the feelings of everyone else on the plane, and try not to do anything that would cause any undue impact or concerns to others on the plane.  For example, there was a recent report of a passenger praying whilst on a plane, which people took offence at - not for religious reasons, but because in doing so he was blocking access to the aisles and toilets.

Similarly I would probably not recommend you decide to start speaking Arabic to another passenger located on the other side of the plane (ie, at a high volume) - just as I would not recommend a passenger shout out a welcome to his friend Jack on the other side of the plane (""Hi Jack!"").

In a perfect world, such discrimination would not exist, but the simple fact is it does. As much as I hate to give advice to try and minimize your profile in places such as (Western) airports and aircraft, the simple fact is that doing so will likely result in an easier trip for you.

Googling 'seagull rooftop nests' brings a decent amount of pictures of rooftop nests. 'Seagull nests' brings a lot of cliff-placed nests, rooftop and ground nests.

They would nest on every roof and attack people that would go out on the balcony with a sandwich.

A recent study by scientists in the U.S. found that viable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. 

However, a subsequent report from the CDC found that genetic material from the virus can live on surfaces for more than two weeks. The CDC found traces of the virus' RNA, not the coronavirus itself, on surfaces in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship – 17 days after passengers had left the cabins.

It's possible that you can become infected if you touch your face after touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, according to the CDC. But scientists don't think surfaces are the main way that the virus spreads; the most common form of infection is from respiratory droplets spread by a person's cough or sneeze, the CDC reports.

Meanwhile, the WHO says it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, traveled and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. That means the virus cannot spread through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting coronavirus cases.

At the same time, the WHO is reportedly encouraging people to use as many digital payment options as possible. Viruses can survive on hard surfaces like coins for days in some cases.

303,expert,academia.stackexchange.com,"I am currently in a job in the US (on STEM OPT). I had a postdoc offer from a large US university that was supposed to start April 16. I signed an offer letter for a two year contract. We were in the process of deciding which visa to apply for (H1/J1). 

Today I got an email from the PI (HR copied) saying she would like to put the position on hold until things settle down. I asked for a clarification on what ""on hold"" meant and whether the offer letter was still valid. The HR replied this (PI copied):


  As for the offer letter you signed (due to redacted’s current
  situation) please consider it void until future notice.
  
  Professor [redacted] will contact you if you are still being considered
  for the position.


This is the last communication I had with the HR or the PI.

What does this mean? Since I have the signed offer, when things do settle down, is the university legally obligated to offer the position back to me before anyone else? Or the university is formally rescinding the offer and I should just move on? Can they do that? 

EDIT: Some answers have asked about my eligibility to work in the US. For clarification: I’m in the US now, in my current status, I can work in the US till the end of May. If the university applied for an H1B (which is typically approved for non profit), I could stay in the US as long as I didn’t leave the country (in which case I would have to get a visa stamped). Things could have gotten more complicated with J1, so we did not discuss much about that. 
","A signed offer letter is normally a valid contract.  Usually it is the only contract document.  Only someone who has read the offer letter can give you a perfect answer to this question.

They have announced their intention to break the contract.  That is illegal unless the offer letter says otherwise.  Moving on is probably your best option.  

There are two possibilities:


The university is unable to pay you, so they are forced to do something that could potentially cause them a lot of harm in the form of bad press or litigation.
They did this voluntarily or out of incompetence, in which case the university is a bad place to work and you are lucky not to be working there.


In either case, you should look for employment elsewhere.
","They rescinded your job offer. Offer letters are not legally binding in the US. You don't have a job anymore and there's nothing you can do about it unless you can convince the PI to hire you.

254,expert,stats.stackexchange.com,"Recently there are a lot of datapoints regarding COVID-19 related deaths. However I am looking to see how big the impact of non-diagnosed patients is.

Therefore I want to evaluate the deaths (corrected for reported virus deaths) and see how these compare to the same period in recent years.

I understand it is best practice to avoid asking for specific data sets here, so I will keep my question as generic as possible and ask for leniency:

Does anyone know how to find (or search for) recent mortality statistics? Ideally this would be ""per day per country up to today"", but even ""a total for February in a continent or city would already be insightful"".



What have I tried so far: 


Searching recent mortality, this only results in virus related statistics
Searching for several countries or WHO, this did not result in anything for this year

","It doesn't seem like the death toll is clearly showing up (yet). 

For instance, Europe has almost up to 10 000 deaths in a single day during the peak of a heavy respiratory season, and the Covid-19 cases will only be a small bump, in relation to the overall burden of disease.

But, that would be playing down the impact of the virus. It is difficult to look at the overall death rate. Many people are dying every day. We can not easily compare a single cause to the total amount of deaths that are occurring.

Important to consider is that Covid-19 deaths have a non-homogeneous spatial distribution and locally there's a high density that's not clear in common (public) databases that (mostly) present aggregate numbers. Also, the outbreak is still young and is not yet fully processed in databases. So with better data we might be better able to see the impact of the disease (I suspect that the agencies have better information).

So the fact that we currently see little influence of Covid-19 on aggregated statistics of death rate is not reassuring because it is meaningless to look at aggregated statistics (this depends a bit on your philosophy about nature and death though, personally I feel we are overreacting, but that is completely different from statistics).

  Note concerning COVID-19 related mortality as part of the all-cause mortality figures reported by EuroMOMO
  
  Over the past few days, the EuroMOMO hub has received many questions about the weekly all-cause mortality data and the possible contribution of any COVID-19 related mortality. Some wonder why no increased mortality is observed in the reported mortality figures for the COVID-19 affected countries.
  The answer is that increased mortality that may occur primarily at subnational level or within smaller focal areas, and/or concentrated within smaller age groups, may not be detected at the overall national level. This even more so in the pooled European-wide analysis, given the large total population denominator. Furthermore, there is always a few weeks of delay in death registration and reporting. Hence, the EuroMOMO mortality figures for the most recent weeks must be interpreted with some caution.
  Therefore, although increased mortality is currently not being observed in the EuroMOMO figures, this does not mean that increased mortality does not occur in some areas or in some age groups, including mortality related to COVID-19.

","Why are errors correlated in the reduced-form VAR?
If the error covariance matrix were restricted to be diagonal in the reduced form, the model would be too restrictive to adequately represent most of real-world time series. You could specify such a restricted model, but the assumption of diagonal covariance matrix would often be violated in practice.

Why are errors uncorrelated in the structural VAR?
Structural VAR with contemporaneous effects and uncorrelated errors is another representation of the same reduced-form VAR model. For convenience of interpretation, the structural representation is defined by lack of error correlation. Other representations with contemporaneous effects but correlated errors are possible but are less interesting.

Summary


Bike sharing is probably safe and healthy, as long as you take certain hygiene and disinfection precautions, as explained in later sections.
Don't ride when sick.
Exercise, in moderation, may strengthen the immune system.
Sun exposure may help you synthesize vitamin D. It's possible that this vitamin somewhat helps protect against COVID-19.


Introduction

It's probably safe and healthy to use bike-sharing during the COVID-19 pandemic — as long as you take some simple precautions.

If you take these precautions, bike-sharing is probably safer than public transit during the pandemic. (Source.)

Please note: If you're sick, please don't use bike sharing. Please use your own car or bike. Or, better yet, please stay home. (Source.)

Hygiene


After riding, wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. (Source.)
If you can't access soap or water, carry and use hand sanitizer instead.


Disinfecting handlebars

You might have thought it unnecessary to disinfect handlebars, for three reasons.


The CDC writes: ""It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. But this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.""
On stainless steel, coronavirus particles can survive for two days, but virus titers start to plummet after just four hours. (Source.)
Ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun seems to destroy coronaviruses. (Source.)


However, during the pandemic, various experts do recommend that you disinfect bike-share bike handlebars and brake levers. If a sick person used a bike right before you, they might have left their germs on the handlebars; disinfection can kill these germs. (Source.)

70% rubbing alcohol solution is probably a good disinfectant to use here.


At home:


Dampen a clean rag, or some paper towels, with 70% rubbing alcohol solution.
Store the result an air-tight bag, so that the alcohol doesn't evaporate.

Later, at the bike-share station:


Dampen the handlebars and brake levers with the solution. Let them stay damp for at least 30 seconds.



In theory, alcohol probably shouldn't damage most rubber items. (Source.) But please see the comments on this post.

Disinfecting wipes containing benzalkonium chloride (e.g. Lysol wipes) are another option. Benzalkonium chloride may promote antibiotic resistance and is toxic to fish. If you do use Lysol wipes, wash your hands after use and before eating.

If there are shortages of disinfecting wipes or rubbing alcohol in your city: Please consider leaving these items for sick people who truly need them. Instead, please avoid touching your face, and wash your hands after riding.

Exercise may strengthen the immune system

The research literature suggests that exercise, if done in moderation, probably strengthens the immune system. (Source.) During a pandemic, experts recommend against exercising in crowded spaces, or beyond the point of exhaustion, or when feeling flu-like symptoms. (Source.)

Sun exposure may protect against COVID-19

When your skin is exposed to moderate amounts of sunlight, it may synthesize vitamin D. (Don't get sunburned; this increases your risk of skin cancer.) Getting enough vitamin D may reduce, but not eliminate, your risk of catching COVID-19. (Source: a MedCram video citing a BMJ meta-analysis. Please see also this BMJ press release and this post.) Regular outdoor exercise may help you to get more sun and to synthesize more vitamin D.

There are other ways to get vitamin D, such as from daily pills; but the details are beyond the scope of this post.

Notes

I'm not a doctor. This thread is for educational purposes only; it is not intended as a substitute for personalized advice from a doctor.
","As a practicing epidemiologist, I'm actually a little puzzled as to the down-votes for this. The difference between an outbreak and an epidemic is pretty subtle, and neither is all that terribly well defined.

The answer: There's not much of a difference.

The CDC agrees with me:


  Occasionally, the amount of disease in a community rises above the
  expected level. Epidemic refers to an increase, often sudden, in the
  number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that
  population in that area. Outbreak carries the same definition of
  epidemic, but is often used for a more limited geographic area.


In practice, I'd argue that an outbreak is, as they mentioned, a somewhat smaller-scale phenomena. I'd talk about an outbreak of norovirus at a university, while I'd say a state, large city or country was having an epidemic. 

I'd also say that, for very low levels of disease, it's possible to have an outbreak without an epidemic. For example, in a paper I wrote, I characterized the cases of disease in a population as ""Low-level endemic spread, punctuated by periodic, short-lived outbreaks"". These outbreaks were on the scale of less than a dozen people, so I'd really have a hard time calling it an epidemic, but again, this is referencing the idea that ""outbreak"" refers to a somewhat smaller geographical scale.

Question: Do bedbugs transmit COVID-19 from person to person?
","Bed bugs eat blood.  Red cells do not contain DNA which can be hijacked by the SARS-CoV-2 virus so the bugs should not have any viable virus unless the bug is covered with infected droplets of someone's cough.  That seems highly improbable.


  Bed bugs are not known to spread disease. Bed bugs can be an annoyance because their presence may cause itching and loss of sleep. Sometimes the itching can lead to excessive scratching that can sometimes increase the chance of a secondary skin infection.


and 


  A common concern with bed bugs is whether or not they transmit diseases. Although bed bugs can harbor various pathogens, transmission to humans has not been proven and is considered unlikely.


However, blood also contains some macrophages which have been shown to possess ACE2 receptors which could lead to the macrophages getting infected though surface expression is low.  One would have to posit that the virus enters the bug's gut but somehow leaves again, and somehow reaches the bugs' beak while being unable to replicate.  

To further put this into perspective a cc of blood has usually less than 15,000 white cells. The volume of blood suckled by a bed bug is a way lot less, and macrophages are further sparse in white cells at 5%.

  motivates such a preoccupation; in cognitive terms, the patient is
  attempting to accommodate his anomalous experience to existing
  schemas. Feelings of centrality or solipsism may come to the fore.


And from Phenomenology of anomalous self-experience in early schizophrenia:



A classic is Knots (1970) by R.D. Laing who was both a psychiatrist and someone who experienced psychosis. I recommend getting a hold of it. It's very short and will make no sense. But it also will, and that's the entire point:



2. Mystical experience

Psychosis and mystical experience are two antipodal human experiences but they both have something in common: they are both departures from our everyday experience of reality. 

The following is from William James' The Varieties Of Religious Experience (1901) which is considered a classic:


  Open any one of these, and you will find abundant cases in which
  ‘mystical ideas’ are cited as characteristic symptoms of enfeebled or
  deluded states of mind. In delusional insanity, paranoia, as they
  sometimes call it, we may have a diabolical mysticism, a sort of
  religious mysticism turned upside down. The same sense of ineffable
  importance in the smallest events, the same texts and words coming
  with new meanings, the same voices and visions and leadings and
  missions, the same controlling by extraneous powers; only this time
  the emotion is pessimistic: instead of consolations we have
  desolations; the meanings are dreadful; and the powers are enemies to
  life.


The point I am making here is that the ""pleasurable form of psychosis"" you are asking about is not called psychosis. It's called mystical experience. Claiming you have insight into the nature of reality will not be called psychosis if one displays minimal or no impairment, and if you can convince others that what you're experiencing is a reality of a type they are willing to entertain as existing. Even still, the presence of unpleasantness/impairment need to necessarily translate into a label of pathology.

From ""Dark nights of the soul"": Phenomenology and neurocognition of spiritual suffering in mysticism and psychosis:



The similarity between psychosis and mysticism is an elephant in the room for religion and psychiatry. It's as though when they carved up their dominion over aspects of reality, psychiatry had to make some concessions. From DSM-V:



And of the experience itself, this is a description from Dostoevsky's The Idiot (1868), detailing what we would characterise as a mystical experience associated with epilepsy:


  For several instants I experience a happiness that is impossible in an
  ordinary state, and of which other people have no conception. I feel
  full harmony in myself and in the whole world, and the feeling is so
  strong and sweet that for a few seconds of such bliss one could give
  up ten years of life, perhaps all of life.
  
  I felt that heaven descended to earth and swallowed me.  I really
  attained god and was imbued with him.  All of you healthy people don't
  even suspect  what happiness is, that happiness that we epileptics
  experience for a second before an attack.

So now we are looking at purchasing travel insurance but we are concerned that the Covid-19 lockdown currently in the UK, will invalidate any insurance we take out now. The optimistic estimates put the end of the lockdown around the 15th June.

Is it worth us taking out the insurance now to protect our existing deposit/holiday or is likely that all insurance policies purchased now will be invalidated if there is an extension to the lockdown?

Any guidance on this is much appreciated.

  check the policy wording or contact the insurer to ensure the cover

I think that's standard now.

You may find it difficult to speak with an insurer by phone as they are swamped with claims and requests for policy amendments and refunds.

If you do find such a policy as you want, make sure you thoroughly read all the documentation.

He recently received an email saying that his flight details have changed, and he finds out that Lufthansa, ATH-ZRH operator, will most likely cancel the flight due to the COVID-19 coronavirus. The other flight is scheduled.

He went to the airport, but the booth told him that they assist only with today's flights, and gave him the central contact number. He calls, but fails getting through, most likely because of the heavy load of calls these days... He'll email them too, but with weekend ahead, it'll probably go without an on time response.

","He shouldn't get stressed too much. Lufthansa/Swiss are rearranging their schedule a bit, due to decreased demand. And yes, this will mean that some flights are cancelled. That does not mean that all flights are cancelled or that they won't take him at all. 

He has a ticket with Swiss, and they have to transport him to his destination, even if on a different flight. He does not have to worry about being ""left behind"" if he doesn't make his first flight.

Is the flight cancelled?

Currently, he does not know. He can (and should) check the flight status online (Swiss timetable and Lufthansa Flight Status).

As long as the flight isn't officially cancelled, it makes little sense to call or go to the airport - they can't tell you much. Also, it makes little sense to re-book if you don't know which flights are going to operate.

What happens if it is cancelled?

If the flight is cancelled, the airline will offer to re-book him on a different one: There are multiple flights from Athens to Zurich, but they could rebook him completely (e.g. going through Frankfurt on Lufthansa). If isn't happy with the new itinerary, they will usually offer other options. He could also get a refund, but it seems like he wants to travel.

If he booked it through a third party (e.g. Expedia), he'll have to go through them for any re-booking.

If the flight isn't cancelled, he should be at the airport early so that he can directly talk to the agents in case of a last-minute cancellation.

On their information page Swiss currently informs passengers that they can freely re-book all tickets bought before March 5th. (However, it seems like your BF wants to travel).

But you can manage the risk.
First of all, the viability of the virus goes down over time and it's sensitive to temperature – so it dies off more quickly in room temperature than it does in the cold.
Second, when you go to a grocery store, people aren't generally touching all the cans on the shelf — although there tends to be more handling of individual items in the produce section.
Among the things you can do to protect yourself and others are:
Ko says it helps to understand the differing levels of risk in different situations. Coming into close contact with a person who is infected with coronavirus carries greater risk than touching a shopping cart that might have been touched by an infected person hours or days earlier.
When it comes to disinfecting things, it makes sense to focus on high-touch surfaces. Ko says you should worry more about disinfecting bathroom doorknobs and faucets at home than about a can of tomato soup from the supermarket.
""There's never anything that has zero risk,"" Ko says, ""but the risk is so much lower than [surfaces] that are more frequently touched.""","Yes. But only if you use the mask properly and don't touch it with your hands afterward.
Those droplets from a cough or sneeze would hit your mask instead of your mouth and nose — good news. But the next step is to take the mask off by the ear bands and either wash or discard it — without touching the front of it.
""That's what I see all the time,"" says Griffin. ""That's why in the studies, masks fail — people don't use them [correctly]. They touch the front of it. They adjust it. They push it down somehow to get their nose stuck out.""
If you touch the front of the mask, whatever that person coughed or sneezed on it is now on your hands.
As this video from the World Health Organization shows, you should take off your mask by removing the elastics or straps from behind your ears. Don't touch the front, and keep the mask away from your face.
One other thing: Ideally you would have eye protection, too, to keep that stranger's sneeze from getting in.

I was looking into traveling to Europe or Japan from the United States. While there is a lot of uncertainty right now, it seems like a good time to buy for later travel.  

In my case I was thinking about tickets for late in the year (not before October). I have also heard that COVID-19 could also ""completely cancel"" 2020. I would love to hear some other thoughts on this.

This is true even for the best of the airlines. Most of the best five-star world-class airlines out there are living off government support! The rich uncle. 

Therefore, unless the airline is supported by the rich uncle, do not buy the ticket.

Linen: If you can wear it, it has the best comfort. It absorbs sweat easily, feels very cool, repels dirt and is germicidal.
Hemp: Not as good as linen, but a viable alternative if you don't like to wear linen.
Silk: For good weather. It is one of the airiest cloth, but you should not wear it with rucksacks etc.
Polyester: There are many clothes in outdoor shops which are very light, easily washable and very comfortable.

  The data of viruses is a little more straight forward � viruses are

  concentrations of bleach on the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). A
  tenfold dilution of bleach, which subsequently mixed with an equal

  eradicated all of the virus. A 100-fold dilution of bleach killed 100%
  of the virus half of the time, and decreased the number of live viral
  particles by greater than three logs in the other half of the tests.
  This was all after five minutes of treatment.
  
  So at least for viruses, you can probably dilute the bleach tenfold
  without worrying too much about decreased antimicrobial activity.


Personally, I don't find any logic why bleach would be more effective diluted, the opposite makes more sense to me. Is there any explanation for this to be so? Or it's just a wrong idea?
","The text does not say that more diluted bleach is more effective at killing viruses (or bacteria, or yeast, for that matter).

A 100-fold dilution of bleach killed 100% of the virus half of the time, and decreased the number of live viral particles by greater than three logs in the other half of the tests. This was all after five minutes of treatment...

So a 20-fold dilution kills all virus always; a 100-fold dilution kills 100% of the virus 50% of the time and kills most of them in the other cases.

","This is a hot topic, and I don’t think there is a firm consensus in the child psychiatry world about the answer. I think a good summary of the literature would leave you with: 


  X, Y, and Z studies showed an association; Χ, Ψ, and Ω studies showed no association.


Excellent. Ιn lieu of that, I'm going to use one study to illustrate a couple methodological points to show you why this answer is difficult to know. My goal is to help the reader develop a skeptical eye when research of this type is presented.

One study used teacher questionnaires about hyperactivity symptoms and student questionnaires about dietary habits to see if a relationship existed between high sugar intake and hyperactivity. They found that children were at statistically higher risk for ADHD if they consumed:  


less sugar from fruit snacks  
low Vitamin C 


However, the total simple sugar intake did not correlate with hyperactivity symptoms.

This makes very little sense. Why should fruit snacks be different from other sugar, and where did Vitamin C come from?


Statistical noise. Data interpretation relies on a ratio of signal:noise to find the signal (in this case, an association). A 5-second brainstorm will bring to mind dozens of unrelated (to usual dietary patterns) topics that may affect what students write down on questionnaires: literacy, gender, upbringing, vocabulary, organization, memory, day-of-the-week, recent holidays, who won the Red Sox game, etc. etc. etc. Some of these may reflect recent dietary patterns that skew the memory of usual dietary patterns; others simply affect the accuracy of report. One could generate an equally diverse list of factors that may affect teacher reports. Either way, the result is the same: a noisy signal.
Confounding. A confound exists when an extraneous factor exists that correlates with both the independent (dietary report) and the dependent (inattentiveness) variable. In this case, one could imagine that students who tend to be careless about reporting might also be those displaying symptoms of hyperactivity (which tends to run with inattentiveness). It’s not obvious whether that would lead to under or over reporting of sugar intake. 

Generally, obvious confounders can be adjusted for statistically (here, I don't see that they did much of that, although they did do separate analyses for boys vs girls). However, no amount of math can adjust for factors that aren’t measured. There was no “carelessness independent of hyperactivity” score obtained here, and we couldn’t expect it &mdash; it’s a basically unknowable parameter. Certain confounders are inherent to the methodology. Math never fixes this.
Multiple comparisons. The basic principle is: if you look at enough factors, something is going to be statistically associated with something else for reasons that have nothing to do with reality. That’s because we define statistical significance as a result that would occur by chance &lt;5% of the time. If you run 20 tests, you have a good chance of coming up with one of them that appears to be positive simply by chance. In data that has a low signal:noise ratio (see #1), this problem is all the more apparent. This is something to think about when unexpected results pop up from a study that was designed to look at something completely different. Vitamin C??!


Please note: this is not meant to be (primarily) a critique of this particular study. My goals here were to help the reader understand: 


Why do I find different answers to this question every time I do a google search?   
How should we think critically about epidemiological data presented on Health.SE?

Go to NCBI BLAST
Click on the big Protein BLAST button

My question is - why would a protein from Bat SARS-like coronavirus and 2019-nCoV be showing up as a perfect match for one another? Does this mean that 2019-nCoV might actually be a previously-discovered coronavirus that very recently started infecting humans? Or could it be that a recently collected sample from Wuhan was mis-identified as 2019-nCoV when it is actually the same coronavirus from the 2018 submission? 

Clicking around the links on that site seem to bring up dozens of similar but different pages that I don't have the knowledge to distinguish, but the Accession column from the search results described above contains a link to this page, which says that it is a provisional refseq and acknowledges that it is identical to the bat coronavirus:

","2019-nCoV is a virus that originated from the bat (at least this is the current hypothesis). It shows 96% squence similarity to the BatCoV RaTG13 sequence (see reference 1), showing its origin.

Then envelope proteins can be critical for function/structure of the virus, so mutations there might occur less frequent. And if they occur, I would only expect few changes over time, so with this little time gone, probably no mutation is seen yet. Additionally, due to the redundancy caused by the codon degeneracy, not every mutation in the genomic material translates into changes in the protein.

","You are confused among DNA replication, DNA transcrption, and RNA translation.

First, DNA replication happens during cell division, it create two exactly same daughter DNA.

Second, DNA transcription transcribes DNA sequence into RNA sequence, this RNA sequence may be used to synthesize protein, or RNA itself as signal, etc.

Third, RNA translation is the RNA sequence (codon) recognized by tRNA, and then synthesize protein sequence.

AUG is a codon in the RNA, the is recognized by tRNA, and then start translation. And please remember, DNA use A, G, C, T, but RNA use A, G, C, U, there is no U in DNA.

The World Health organization defines a pandemic as ""the worldwide spread of a new disease,"" and on March 11, the WHO's director general announced that COVID-19 met those criteria.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director general, stressed that the designation doesn't mean that citizens should stop trying to contain the virus.

""Find, isolate, test and treat every case, and trace every contact,"" he said. ""Ready your hospitals. Protect and train your health care workers.""

For the United States, community transmission in several cities and a growing number of cases that aren't able to be traced to travel or contact with individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 makes it probable that there will be extensive spread here.

""A lot of us have been sitting back and watching this from a distant place,"" Schaffner noted, adding that the game has changed in recent days. He cautioned against ""running around like a chicken with its head cut off,"" and recommended thinking ahead. A large increase in cases in your community could mean school closures or other changes to your routine.

328,expert,economics.stackexchange.com,"I'm trying to understand this r/explainlikeimfive analogy. I rectified typos, and simplified some  names and numbers. 


Won't Cal demand  his principal back at some time in the future? 
Similarly, won't countries' sovereign debts demand their principal? 
For example, China holds much US treasuries and US sovereign debt. If China thinks COVID-2019 will cripple the US and wants to park its money else where, won't China demand all of its principal from the US so that it can buy Australia or New Zealand sovereign debt instead? 



  'Country A owes \$10  to country B, and has agreed to pay 2% interest annually. Call this Debt X.
  
  Country B owes \$15  to country A, and has agreed to pay 1% interest annually. This is Debt Y.
  
  Investor A is willing to purchase Debt X for \$12, because he values the steady rate of return, and believes country A is very likely to pay its debts. He isn't as sure about Debt Y, but he is willing to pay \$16 for it. Investor B thinks that investor A is going to change his mind about Debt Y and value it more highly, so he is willing to pay \$17 for it today.
  
  Debt is traded constantly and it's valued differently. Just because 2 countries owe each other similar amounts of money, doesn't mean the value cancels out in any meaningful way.
  
  Think of debt this way. You and your three brothers all own a house together. Each year you take up a collection of \$1000 a head for \$~4k annual upkeep on the house. One year, a tree falls on the roof, and the house needs another \$4000 bucks. Everyone could just chip in 1k each, but one brother is having a tough year, so instead, you loan the house \$4k, with the expectation that it will pay you 1% interest a year.
  
  Your brothers agree, and over the years, this comes up a few more times. You even use debt to finance installing a new hottub. You now own \$20k in debt from the house, 1 brother owns \$5k, and for some weird reason, your neighbor Cal wants to purchase the debt from you. (He really thinks your household is trustworthy, and wants somewhere to park \$20k for 1% interest).
  
  Now C owns \$20k of debt from your house, so C owns 80% of all your house's debt. Would you say C owns your house now? Well of course not, your house is likely worth many times more what C has claim to. If someone in your house is super worried about the situation, they could take up a collection in the house to buy the debt back from C, but it's not a popular idea, because most people can think of better things to do with their money than pay off C so they don't have to make the small yearly interest payments.

","
The principal has to be repaid eventually but with majority of formal debt instruments such as government bonds the creditor can’t just demand repayment whenever he or she wants. Most debt instruments have pre-specified date and if not date then conditions when and how the principal is being paid back.


For example a standard 10year bond will pay its principal in 10 years not a day earlier (unless you actually manage to convince the debtor to voluntary agree to pay it sooner).


The above works for sovereign countries too. A 10 year government bond will have on it printed that principal is payed back exactly after 10years. 


Now this is outside economics, but technically sovereign nations are in state of anarchy so I can imagine one country could just decide to say to another pay now or we will invade you/nuke you etc. but aside of some military intervention there is no way of legally forcing the country to pay.

In fact any government can, in principle, default on its debts anytime it wants. The only constraint on sovereign default is that if you constantly default on your debt nobody will want to lend you money in the future, or if only at punitively high interest. Hence on sovereign level governments as debtors have much better bargaining power than just individuals.

Government can be forced to pay its debt only through military action, or in some cases by diplomatic pressure (for example EU could threaten Greece by revoking its euro-zone or EU membership, US could threaten countries by economic sanctions etc.). Aside from that there is nothing other country can do to get its money back if debtor nation says no.


Based on 1, and 2 you probably already know the answer. No that’s not possible. China could patiently wait for bonds to expire and then not buy new US bonds but instead buy Australian or New Zeeland bonds. Of course, since there is a lot of debt being issued by US government probably every month there are bonds expiring and being replaced by new ones so China could start do it sooner than later.


Also beside of that, usually when people want to get rid of a debt they won’t wait for maturity and for repayment of the principal. They will take the bond to bond market and sell it at market price to get money now. That creates a trouble for country in a sense that now it has to set lower price or higher interest on its newly issued bonds due to increased supply, but whether this becomes a problem depends on plethora of factors many unrelated to the original debtor and creditor countries, such as how big is the demand for the debtors bonds etc.
","The short answer to your question is no, stock prices have no direct effect on the total amount of money in an economy, just as the price of apples has no effect on the total amount of money in an economy. The wikipedia page on money has an explanation of the various ways you might define money, and none of them include the valuation of stocks. Here's the requested simple example: Say there are \$100 in circulation. There is one stock traded, and it is valued at \$10. Then, it is valued at \$20. But there is still \$100 in circulation.

On r/Economics, u/ComfortableCold9 asked


  From your point of view, at what point would we [the USA in 2020] be approaching weimar? A QE program of 15 trillion? 25 trillion?


Right under, u/Bumblewurth answered


  From my point of view, never. What made hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic and (most other regimes with hyperinflation) was printing marks to pay debts in gold. The whole point of QE is to provide liquidity (already there) and to prevent deflation/meet inflation targets (not there yet.) If we're at QE with 25 trillion it's because we still haven't seen inflation in consumer prices.
  
  Inequality will be through the roof though as asset prices inflate.


u/Bumblewurth answers u/ComfortableCold9's follow-ups quoted in line.


  
    [u/ComfortableCold9 :] So seeing as we pay our debts in dollar, that suggests to me that we are effectively reliant on the dollar maintaining its strength
  
  
  [u/Bumblewurth :] No we aren't. If the dollar falls, the debts fall with the dollar. That's the difference between hyperinflationary economies in the past with non-sovereign debt and modern economies with sovereign debt. You aren't printing more dollars to chase the same amount of gold.
  
  
    But as soon as we start to see a level of inflation that would warrant a massive QT program, the economy would be held hostage.
  
  
  Economy is held hostage with deflation risk already. There's risk everywhere. That's life. But QE won't cause hyperinflation, just a whole lot of asset inflation and inequality.
  
  Most of this could be avoided if we weren't so tepid about using fiscal policy or if the fed had a fiscal tool to just send checks to everyone to manage deflation. Monetary policy is pushing on a string. But congress won't act, so here we are; Just like in 2008.



Like u/ComfortableCold9 below, I too ""don't see a difference""? 
I don't understand Bumblewurth's distinction between ""future obligations"" and ""current debts"". ""Current debts are wiped out when you monetize them"" — So what? 



  
    [u/ComfortableCold9 :] I don't see a difference here; if the dollar started to lose lose strength, you would have to print more dollars to get the same value of what you're buying.
  
  
  Yes, that's a concern for future obligations, not current debts. Current debts are wiped out when you monetize them. But once you get inflation you stop QE because the entire point of QE is to create inflation so that demand is at productive capacity. You aren't printing money to cover obligations and then printing ever more to cover the same obligations as your currency falls. You're printing more to prevent deflation. That's the point. QE and Weimar aren't related.

","If you want something ""even more ELI5"", try this from the Atlantic:


  Let me unpack these one by one. Right now getting the markets to buy our debt isn't the problem. Getting enough debt for the markets to buy is the problem. Investors are so crazy to load up on Treasuries that they're actually paying us to borrow, taking inflation into account. But while we're currently getting free money from investors, Hungary circa 1945 was getting no money. It was an investment pariah. If Hungary wanted to rebuild its economy, its only recourse was the printing press.    
  
  Second, the United States isn't really printing money. At least not like post-war Hungary. Quantitative easing is usually described as ""money-printing"" but it's not really. QE involves the Fed buying longer-term bonds from banks. It simply swaps one asset for another -- in this case, cash for longer-term bonds. Unlike Hungary, the Fed isn't directly paying the Treasury's bills. This is a hugely important distinction.
  
  Whatever money the Fed ""prints"" is stuck in the banks. That money isn't inflationary as long as the banks don't lend it out. What if the banks do start lending at a faster clip? The Fed can still effectively pay the banks not lend by, for example, raising the interest on excess reserves or require the banks to set aside more money. It would be shocking for the Fed not to pursue one of these options.
  
  Third, the most important difference between us and post-war Hungary or Weimar is that our roads haven't been razed to the ground and half the country isn't striking. It's very difficult to have hyperinflation when you still have a functioning economy. Almost all examples of hyperinflation result from huge economic shocks that devastate an economy so much that leaders think printing money is the only solution to growth. As bad as the Great Recession has been, our GDP is already back to and above its all-time pre-recession high. As bad as unemployment is, more than 80 percent of the labor force is working. In Zimbabwe, 80 percent of the population was unemployed.
  
  Let's conclude with a modest proposal for an economic corollary to Godwin's Law. The first person to reference Weimar's hyperinflation in an economic debate automatically loses.


Yeah, it was written in 2012... Nowadays there are some fears (time will tell if justified) that people returning from the lockdowns [when those end] will cause ""unexpected"" inflation. But that's a different story, not really about QE.

And if you want more recent data on where US inflation is headed, ""this just in"":

  The general price level decline is expected even as the Federal Reserve has adopted extraordinary measures to stop the economy’s free-fall. [...]

 Yes, there is way more than one trillion dollars of wealth in the world. Depending on the laws of physics and psychology there is probably something you would be able to market for this amount.

83,biomedical,health.stackexchange.com,"As of time of writing it's quite common to see headlines about so-and-so who have tested positive for Covid-19, e.g. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau's wife, Sophie, tests positive for coronavirus, officials say

However, these articles don't usually say how reliable the testing is. I couldn't find any recent information on it via Google, either (there are some results, e.g. this, but they are old).

How accurate are the tests? What are the odds that Sophie Trudeau's results are a false positive, or that Justin Trudeau's negative result is a false negative?
","Short answer: Sophie Trudeau's positive test may still mean 3 : 1 odds of not having contracted Covid-19, but the odds could also be far more towards having Covid-19.
Justin Trudeau's negative test almost certainly means he was negative when tested. Of course, should Sophie be positive, that may have changed by now.



Update: I found a web page of the FDA listing tests that have this Emergency Use Approval. Each of them has manufacturer instuctions that list their test results towards the end. Some of the submitted test results use ≈100 negative samples in the clinical evaluation. But there is also one that has only 13 positive cases (all of which were correctly found) in their test - but that one got the emergency approval already early in February.
The latest 2 (by Thermo and Roche) used 60/60 and 50/100 cases for their clinical evaluation (all results correct). That gets the lower end of the confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity to 94 - 97 % (with the lower end of the c.i. we'd thus have LR+ >≈ 20 or 17, expected values would be 61 or 51, respectively. For LR- &lt;≈ 1/20 or 1/32 (expected 1/61 or 1/100). 



Long version: Let's do some number juggling and see whether we can extract something useful. The following calculations are based on a somewhat worst-case scenario: the FDA emergency validation guidelines specify outcomes that such a new test in the current emergency situation must meet, and I calculate from the low end of performance that could be expected meet these criteria under somewhat unlucky circumstances.

So we know minimum performance requirements, but I do not know [yet] how good (= how much better than minimum performance) the tests are.

Sensitivity and Specificity

The starting point would be sensitivity and specificity of the respective test.  I haven't found any published data on these, but the FDA has a Policy for Diagnostics Testing for Coronavirus Disease-2019 that says how labs that develop a test should do an ""emergency validation"". They can then get Emergency Use Approval.  


Sensitivity tells us: of all truly Covid-19-positive specimen, which percentage is correctly recognized as positive by the test; I'm going to use  87.5 % (see below)
Specificity tells us: of all specimen that are truly negative for Covid-19, which percentage is correctly recognized by the test.


Sensitivity and specificity can be measured by standardized protocols, and they characterize the performance of the test. 

From a patient's or doctor's point of view, however, they are not very useful numbers as they (we) need the answer to the inverse questions:

Predictive values


positive predictive value PPV: given that the test yielded positive, what is the probability that the patient truly has the virus?
negative predictive value NPV: given that the test yielded negative, what is the probability that the patient truly does not have the virus?


Predictive values can be calculated from sensitivity and specificity together with the prevalence (or, as we are talking about newly infected patients, the incidence) of virus among the tested population. Here's how they go for the assumed sensitivity and specificity:


red for positive test outcomes, dark green for negative test outcomes. posterior probability = after the test said something, what is the probability that the test result is correct = NPV for negative test result, PPV for positive test result.

Good estimates of prevalence are often difficult to obtain, because we need the prevalence among those who are tested and that is (and should be) quite different from the prevalence of the disease in the general population. 

For some countries such as Italy, we have numbers of performed tests (Wiki page giving numbers for more countries): as of today (March 14th), they ran 109170 tests and have a total of 21157 cases. Not all tests are for initial diagnosis (AFAIK, a patient is considered cured only after a bunch of tests are negative), but as most cases are still ""fresh"", we may the ratio positive cases : tests run as one surrogate for the prevalence in the tested population. This would be around 20 % for Italy. 

From the diagram we can then read for a new patient being tested the first time:


if the test outcome is positive, chances are ≈ 75 % (or greater as I'm calcluating with the lower end of the possible range from the emergency validation) that the patient really has Covid-19.
So, up to 25 % false positives. 
if the test outcome is negative, chances are ≈ 95 % (or greater...) that the patient really does not have Covid-19.
So, up to 5 % false negatives. 


Canada currently reports 25 positive out of a total of 796 tests, so about 3 % prevalence in the tested population.

For the USA, the CDC reports case numbers and test numbers, currently 1629 cases with (3995 + 15749) tests - but it is not entirely clear to me whether the populations completely coincide. Anyways, I'll use 8 % as guesstimate for prevalence.

| prevalence |  PPV |    NPV | Country/Population | 
+------------+------+--------+--------------------+
| 3 %        | 26 % | 99.6 % | Canada             |
| 8-9 % (?)  | 50 % | 98.8 % | USA, Germany       |
| 20 %       | 75 % | 95   % | Italy              |



Now that is the population of ""everyone who is tested"". At least for Germany (March 14th) but probably also for Canada and the US, tests are done on people who show symptoms and on people that are known to have had contact with Corona virus cases: if they are found to be positive, they are sent home to quarantine and wait whether they did acutally catch the disease. But we may still say that the ""people who are tested"" population has subpopulations with and without symptoms.
So if there are further point of suspicion, say, the patient does cough, we'd say they belong to a high risk subpopulation with higher prevalence of Covid-19 compared to the overall prevalence among tested, so the chance of a false positive would be lower for them.  

This will change as tests are performed only on people who show symptoms (by now, March 16th, everyone is already  told to stay at home in Germany and self-isolate as well as possible - the test result will not change this in any way).  

Handy for quick calculation: likelihood ratio positive (LR+) and negative (LR-)

If we express the prevalence as odds (1 : 99 instead of 1 %), LR+ and LR- allow easy back-of-the envelope calculations. 

LR+ = sensitivity / (1 - specificity) ≈ 11 or better for our test and 
LR- = (1 - sensitivity) / specificity ≈ 0.05 = 1/20 or better for our test.

so they are indpendent of the prevalence and they tell us how the odds change due to the test: the posterior probability (predictive values) are the the pre-test odds multiplied with the likelihood ratio. In that sense, they tell us how much information we gain due to test (for positive and negative outcomes).

So, Canada reported odds of 25 positive : 771 negative tests. So for Sophie Trudeau, the odds went from 25 : 771 (or 3 %) to  25 : 771 * 11 = 273 : 771 ≈ 1 : 3 or 25 %. For Justin Trudeau 25 : 771 / 20 = 25 : 15420 ≈ 1 : 617 or 0.16 % of being Covid-19 positive (slight discrepancy to above due to rounding).

On the other hand, if we start testing more and more people for whom the risk of actcually having contracted the virus is lower and lower, we soon won't be able to draw meaningful conclusions from the test results any more: I'm in Germany, currently the federal info page lists 3800 confirmed cases. Even if we assume that there is a huge dark figure and in reality 20 x as many people are infected* that would be a prevalence in the general population of 0.1 %, the odds are 1 infected : 1.5 mio non-infected. If someone who does not belong to any particular risk group were tested positive, their odds would increase by factor 11, i.e. roughly 1 : 140000. A negative test result would decrease the odds by a factor of 1/20 to 1 : 31 mio. However, both results are of no practical use as they don't change the situation: pre-test situation is ""very unlikely to be Covid-19 case"", post-test situation is still ""very unlikely to be Covid-19 case"".

This is why, even if there were testing capacities for the whole population, tests don't make sense unless we know there are some risk factors such as some kind of respiratory disease or contact to someone who is known to have the virus. And why it is sensible to say that on slightly suspicious circumstances (= low, but not extremely low prevalence), one should self-quarantine/avoid contact but there's no point in testing [yet].



Detais on how I estimate sensitivity and specificity


The lab first determines the limit of detection (LoD) for virus RNA. The LoD here is the lowest concentration at which 19 out of 20 replicate tests are positive (that would be 95 % sensitivity, but for samples spiked in the lab, but with a relevant and as difficult as possible matrix such as sputum). 
Next, [leftover] clinical samples are used: 


As there may not be any positive samples available, the lab can spike negative samples with virus RNA; a minimum of 20 samples are spiked within a range of 1 - 2 LoD plus 10 samples to cover the remaining clinical range.
Of these, at most 1 is allowed to have negative outcome (and that must be one in the lower concentration range). Thus, 29 positive out of 30 true positive. 
Also 30 non-reactive specimens are tested. The policy doesn't say a number of false positives that is permissible, so I'm going to assume that must be zero.  

The lab can then start with real patient samples. The first 5 positive and the first 5 negative cases must be confirmed by an approved test (and must all match). 


Pooling the 2 ""rounds"" of testing clinical samples, we have:


34 (or 35) positive tests out of 35 truly positive specimen -> sensitivity at least 97 % with 95% credible interval 87.5 - 100 %,
specficity 100 % with 95% credible interval 92 - 100 %
There are additional checks required but they don't help us here.
Sampling errors are not included in this validation.
I'm not a clinical chemist, but I'm analytical chemist and in general analytical chemistry, that can easily be the dominating source of error. In that case, the above numbers would be useless.
Particularly the sensitivity may drop over time as the virus mutates. 
To deal with this, in some cases multiple tests are done (read that in some newspaper article which I don't find at the moment).
When doing multiple tests, tests by different providers are used if possible: as they are developed from different virus samples, this gives a better coverage for mutations in the virus than doing the same test in replicate.




* Very handwavy scenario I derived from the development of case numbers in China after their quarantine/shutdown on Jan 26, assuming an incubation period of 2 weeks and that noone got infected after quarantine started.
","Basically, the signal transduction pathway of PGI2 involves a Gs protein. This Gs protein involves the increase in cAMP (through adenylate cyclase; I am assuming you know the signal transduction pathways). Thus, when you administer Dipyridamole, phosphodiesterase is inhibited (which would've degraded your cAMP), thus there is an augmented effect of the PGI2.

Go through this article and check out the first image there. On the very left of the image, you can find the PGI2 pathway.

178,biomedical,health.stackexchange.com,"On healthline it's mentioned  a recent study that came out of Wuhan, China; it’s published on a website, but hasn’t yet been reviewed by peers.


  In the study, scientists looked at the blood types of 2,173 people who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and compared that with the blood types of the general population in that region.
  
  They found that in the normal population, type A was 31 percent, type B was 24 percent, type AB was 9 percent, and type O was 34 percent.
  
  In those with the virus, type A was 38 percent, type B was 26 percent, type AB was 10 percent, and type O was 25 percent.
  
  The researchers concluded that “blood group A had a significantly higher risk for COVID-19 compared with non-A blood groups. Whereas blood group O had a significantly lower risk for the infectious disease compared with non-A blood groups.”


In 'non-medical' or easy to follow terms/explanations, Why is that?

Why does blood type A is more at risk?

and Why does blood type O has less risk?

Thank you in advance
","In simpler terminology than used in the paper referred to, the observation has been made before that there is a blood group susceptibility to certain viruses, and that SARS appeared to affect blood group O individuals less than group A.

Group O individuals possess antibodies against the antigens displayed by group A individuals on their cells.  These antibodies, anti-A, interfered with the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the ACE2 receptor - like a form of neutralizing antibody or natural protection.  Their small studies suggested that Group O individuals had 60% of the risk of the full population and Group A individuals an increased risk of 120%.  AB Blood group risk ranged from 148-200% increased risk.

Whether that is clinically useful remains to be seen.  Could pooled immunoglobulin from Group O individuals help infected sick Covid-19 patients? Would any vaccine directed against this region of the virus be ineffective in Group A/B individuals because they would be trying to create a vaccine against self antigens?
","Overloading on vitamin C won't cause death. At around 1000 mg, you will probably have nausea, diarrhea, and stomach aches. 2000 mg is the daily limit, and if you get that high, you will experience more severe side-affects such as severe headaches, vomiting, heartburn, insomnia, and even kidney stones. You probably shouldn't have that much vitamin C, so if you have to take multiple 1000 mg doses everyday, you should talk to your doctor.

In conclusion, taking that much vitamin C is not necessarily ""dangerous"", but it can lead to major discomfort and could possible put you in the hospital.

","If you received a refund in 2018 or 2019 via direct deposit to your bank account, and you did not change your bank account when you moved, you should be able to receive your rebate via direct deposit.

Tax experts said that they think it would be helpful for the IRS to provide guidance for taxpayers who have moved or have new bank accounts since they filed their most recent tax return.

Under the bill, the IRS has to send a notice to a taxpayer’s last known address within 15 days of distributing a payment. The notice should provide information about the payment amount, the method used to make the payment and an IRS phone number to report failures to receive the payment.","The coronavirus is a new phenomenon, which means scientists are only now beginning to research possible treatments or vaccines. No treatments have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, though there is a drug being tested on a patient who was repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
That drug, Remdesivir, was first developed as a potential treatment for MERS and SARS in animals and for Ebola in humans. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is working on a study to test whether the drug would be a suitable treatment for this coronavirus.
But until a treatment is developed, someone with a severe case of the virus will be treated with supportive care — in extreme cases, with intubation tubes and breathing machines.
The real silver bullet for any epidemic or pandemic is a vaccine — and that’s going to take a while. Some in the Trump administration have promised a vaccine within the space of a few months, but that’s extremely unlikely.

519,general,politics.stackexchange.com,"In libertarianism, each person is responsible for their own health.  Nobody is forced to take health insurance, and a hospital is not obliged to provide care to an individual who cannot pay for the bill (either by themselves, via insurance, or hoping for donations).  If you break your leg and can't pay for treatment, you don't get treatment.

How does the inherently individualistic libertarianism deal with the inherently collective threat of a contagious disease, which may become an epidemic?  If a sick individual is not treated, they may infect hundreds of others.  Quarantining the sick individual against their will goes against individual freedom.  In theory one could argue they may be liable for the medical costs of everyone they infect, but that is not helpful when people don't know who infected them and the infected individual can't afford treatment for hundreds of others.

Most countries deal with this threat by collectively paying for healthcare and drastically reducing the freedom of infected individuals, effectively putting them under house arrest or forcing them into hospital against their will.  Even the freedom of many healthy people is substantially reduced.  What alternatives does libertarianism propose to this, if any?
","While I haven't found a reference discussing the libertarian approach to pandemics more generally, I did find one about vaccines, which should be relevant enough, because it's another, related ""collective action problem"":


  Libertarianism and collective action: is there a libertarian case for mandatory vaccination?
  
  In his paper ‘A libertarian case for mandatory vaccination’, Jason Brennan argues that even libertarians, who are very averse to coercive measures, should support mandatory vaccination to combat the harmful disease outbreaks that can be caused by non-vaccination. He argues that libertarians should accept the clean hands principle, which would justify mandatory vaccination. The principle states that there is a (sometimes enforceable) moral obligation not to participate in collectively harmful activities. Once libertarians accept the principle, they will be compelled to support mandatory vaccination. In my paper, I argue that the cases Brennan uses to justify this principle are disanalogous to the case of non-vaccination and that they are not compelling to libertarians. The cases Brennan offers can be explained by a libertarian using the individual sufficiency principle: which states that if an individual’s action is sufficient to cause harm, then there is a (sometimes enforceable) moral obligation not to carry out that action. I argue that this principle is more appropriate to Brennan’s examples, and more appealing to the libertarian, than the clean hands principle. In order to get libertarians to accept the clean hands principle, I present a modified version of one of Brennan’s cases that is analogous to the case of non-vaccination. Using this case, I argue that whether the clean hands principle will justify mandatory vaccination is dependent on whether the herd immunity rate in a given population is approaching a threshold after which a collective risk of harm will be imposed onto others.


So, one could say ""libertarians disagree"" [on the exact approach] to such matters based on that discussion. (And it would not be the only thing they disagree about.)

Actually, there is an article in the Telegraph that even says:


  How can libertarians ever support mandatory quarantine and nationwide lockdowns? 
  
  Quite easily, as it happens. I can’t speak for all libertarians (who can?) but I see libertarianism as applied economics. The government should leave businesses alone unless there are demonstrable market failures and it should leave people alone unless they are doing direct harm to others.
  
  In case it is not obvious, infecting somebody with a potentially fatal virus counts as direct harm to others....


I haven't read the rest, but I'm guessing he's going to argue from externalities viewpoint... which according to other libertarians (Ryan Bourne of Cato in this case) is rapid descent on the slippery slope:


  The classic recommended government remedy for this problem is to try to calculate the marginal external costs or benefits associated with a given activity (beyond the private costs or benefits) and implement taxes or subsidies so these externalities are priced in when consumption or production decisions are made. Joseph Stiglitz’s Nobel lecture is a good description of this policy solution.
  
  Given the pervasiveness of externalities, applying this logic consistently and universally would result in an extremely intrusive government.  [...]
  
  The logic of banning or adopting prohibitively high sin taxes, in contrast, is that the optimal consumption level of anything with external costs is zero. This is an absurd principle, albeit one that is regularly espoused. It is common, for example, to hear commentators and policymakers advocate for a zero-carbon economy. The UK government’s recent announcement that it plans to ban all gas and diesel vehicles by the year 2040 is an example of a policy that will almost certainly impose net social costs on society.


So yeah, from this latter ""more"" libertarian viewpoint, how do you account for the fact that infecting others is only a probability, not a certainty?

As an intermission, it would be interesting if the ""father"" of ""paleolibertarianism"" had something concrete to say on this ([the probability] of infection [of others]), but insofar I wasn't able to find out that, but only some imperfect analogies that he made:


  Probably the most widely accepted doctrine within libertarianism is the “nonaggression” principle, which Rothbard uses as the central theme of his book. The “nonaggression” principle states that “no man or group of men may aggress against the person or
  property of anyone else” (27). Thus, slavery was considered to be intrinsically evil because it
  violated property rights, or the right of a person to be secure in themselves. Yelling “Fire!” in a
  crowded theater, Rothbard argues, should not be restricted because free speech is only a relative
  right; rather, it is criminal because it violates the private property rights of others in the theater
  (52). Essentially, he ascribes to the belief that individuals have an absolute right to be secure in
  their persons and goes on to apply it to numerous other aspects of life. Whether it be education,
  roads, courts, foreign policy, or critiquing the ever-popular Keynesian theory of economics,
  Rothbard consistently believes that the rights of the individual are incontrovertible. His beliefs
  are best summed up as follows:
  
  
    And, indeed, what is the State anyway but organized banditry? What is taxation but theft
    on a gigantic, unchecked, scale? What is war but mass murder on a scale impossible by
    private police forces? What is conscription but mass enslavement? Can anyone envision a private police force getting away with a tiny fraction of what States get away with, and
    do habitually, year after year, century after century? (293-294)
  
  
  This argument continues to be the bedrock of radical libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism, as it
  provides a consistent philosophy that can be applied across all aspects of life. Moderate
  libertarian thinkers tend to diverge from Rothbard, however, on the issue of how to implement
  these ideals. Some, like Rothbard, want sweeping change and scoff at others who argue for
  gradualism. Others, however, realize that government is needed in some limited capacity to
  retain order and that the free market has limits.


Actually Lew Rockwell interprets Rothbard for us in the present context:


  The fundamental rule for deciding whether anyone, including the government, is justified in using force to make us do something we don’t want to do is the nonaggression principle (NAP). As Murray put in in “War, Peace, and the State,” “No one may threaten or commit violence (‘aggress’) against another man’s person or property. Violence may be employed only against the man who commits such violence; that is, only defensively against the aggressive violence of another. In short, no violence may be employed against a nonaggressor.”
  
  You might at first think that you can use the NAP to justify forced quarantines against the coronavirus. Suppose someone had a deadly disease that would always spread to others if he came in contact with them. Probably the person would want to isolate himself and not infect others, but if he refused, wouldn’t the people in danger be justified in isolating him? He is a threat to others, even if he doesn’t intend to harm them. 
  
  Thinking about this case can lead us astray, and here is where Murray can help us most. In his great book The Ethics of Liberty, he says, “It is important to insist, however, that the threat of aggression be palpable, immediate, and direct, in short, that it be embodied in the initiation of an overt act. Any remote or indirect criterion—any ‘risk’ or ‘threat’—is simply an excuse for invasive action by the supposed ‘defender’ against the alleged ‘threat.’” Murray hammers home the point later in the book. He says, “Once one can use force against someone because of his ‘risky’ activities, the sky is the limit, and there is virtually no limit to aggression against the rights of others. Once permit someone’s ‘fear’ of the ‘risky’ activities of others to lead to coercive action, then any tyranny becomes justified.”
  
  When we apply what Murray says to the coronavirus situation, we can answer our question about forced quarantines. People are not threatening others with immediate death by contagion. Rather, if you have the disease, you might pass it on to others. Or you might not. What happens if someone gets the disease is also uncertain.


Bourne (whom one might peg in the less ""paleo"" camp) also comments on the Covid-19 issue as well (on Apr 6):


  the longer lockdowns go on, the more the income losses for businesses and households turn into bankruptcies and defaults, risking a depression. So economists recognise that the costs and benefits of policy will change over time. They will look for ways of maintaining low health risks but at lower economic and social cost than crude shutdowns, recognising this balance changes as the pandemic evolves.
  
  Indeed, once the transmission rate has been brought down and more people recover from the virus, the calculations could change drastically. If I were one of the last 50 people in the whole country to have not yet been infected, I would not expect a destructive national lockdown to protect me. So, clearly, there comes a point when it’s better to relax things from an economic welfare perspective. That could come much sooner than we think.


Interestingly, it still considers a/the notion of welfare to society as a whole as relevant... but in view of how much [herd] immunity there is... which  actually is quite to the similar argument from the opening quote I gave in this answer. 

And it's easy to get sucked into the myriad variation of responses to Covid-19 of US libertarian writers/personalities/politicians (thus make this answer way too long), but I'll mention here anyway that Ron Paul (who ran for president on a Libertarian Party ticket at one point), has called (April 10) for Fauci to be fired because (according to Paul) Fauci infringed on American liberties by overestimating the number of potential deaths from Covid-19.


  ""[...] they made these dire predictions so that they could go ahead and destroy peoples’ civil liberties and spend a lot of money and make up an excuse on why the stock market actually went down — all kinds of things by having this coronavirus event blown way out of proportion,” Mr. Paul said. “He should be fired,” Mr. Paul said about Dr. Fauci. [...]


Personality polemics aside, it seems that in most libertarian discourse the probability of infection (and death) needs to be considered, so it's not too different from how others approach the matter, but perhaps the probability is (subjectively?) ""tuned down"" at least in some US libertarian discourse. However, the most hardcore/paleo libertarians seem to reject that quantines could ever be justified.

First of all, IMHO this question can't be answered objectively, because no court has of yet ruled on whether the practice is legal. 

State court didn't hear any arguments on the topic, since the lawsuit filed by Pontiac had a radically different set of arguments.

Federal circuit court basically threw the issue BACK to the state saying ""we wash our hands off this"", in the best tradition of political actors going back to Pontius Pilate :)





Second of all, House people are officially claiming that no laws or rules were violated (whether they are correct or not is, again, a question that a court has NOT yet answered).

The meat of the issue is, distilled, as follows:


MI state constitution allows some bills to be passed in the Legislature as ""immediate effect"" (I won't bother with the links or quotes - see CJR link below or lawsuit link above for details)
This means the bill takes effect at passage, instead of 90 days later
This requires 2/3ds votes (super-majority) of both houses
The bills were being passed by a so-called ""rising vote"" voting (basically, the speaker guesses how many people voted ""yay"" and that's all she wrote), as opposed to roll call where every member's vote is recorded.
Minority may request a vote to be roll call...
BUTE, apparently, there seems to be some sort of technicality with how the roll call can be requested that basically allows majority to ignore the minority's request (minority must be called on to request... and majority doesn't have to call on them). Gotta LOVE politics.








Third of all, while Maddow tried to make it like some nefarious evil totalitarian power grab by Republicans (even throwing out stats like 90%+ of bills passed that way by Republicans)... subsequent second looks reveals that Democrats... did exactly the same thing. 


  Of the 761 bills passed when the Democrats had control of the House, 744 had “immediate effect.” (quoted by GOP press secretary, but confirmed by Columbia Journalism Review - not exactly a hotbed of conservatism).



For anyone who wants an in-depth and somewhat balanced look at the story, CJR's article seems to be a good starting point (http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/maddow_michigan.php?page=all&amp;print=true)

zero-carbon economy. the uk government is recent announcement that it plans to ban all gas and diesel vehicles by the year 2040 is an example of a policy that will almost certainly impose net social costs on society.   so yeah, from this latter  more  libertarian viewpoint, how do you account for the fact that infecting others is only a probability, not a certainty   as an intermission, it would be interesting if the  father  of  paleolibertarianism  had something concrete to say on this   the probability  of infection  of others  , but insofar i was not able to find out that, but only some imperfect analogies that he made:    probably the most widely accepted doctrine within libertarianism is the  nonaggression  principle, which rothbard uses as the central theme of his book. the  nonaggression  principle states that  no man or group of men may aggress against the person or  property of anyone else   27 . thus, slavery was considered to be intrinsically evil because it  violated property rights, or the right of a person to be secure in themselves. yelling  fire   in a  crowded theater, rothbard argues, should not be restricted because free speech is only a relative  right  rather, it is criminal because it violates the private property rights of others in the theater   52 . essentially, he ascribes to the belief that individuals have an absolute right to be secure in  their persons and goes on to apply it to numerous other aspects of life. whether it be education,  roads, courts, foreign policy, or critiquing the ever-popular keynesian theory of economics,  rothbard consistently believes that the rights of the individual are incontrovertible. his beliefs  are best summed up as follows:      and, indeed, what is the state anyway but organized banditry  what is taxation but theft  on a gigantic, unchecked, scale  what is war but mass murder on a scale impossible by  private police forces  what is conscription but mass enslavement  can anyone envision a private police force getting away with a tiny fraction of what states get away with, and  do habitually, year after year, century after century   293-294       this argument continues to be the bedrock of radical libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism, as it  provides a consistent philosophy that can be applied across all aspects of life. moderate  libertarian thinkers tend to diverge from rothbard, however, on the issue of how to implement  these ideals. some, like rothbard, want sweeping change and scoff at others who argue for  gradualism. others, however, realize that government is needed in some limited capacity to  retain order and that the free market has limits.   actually lew rockwell interprets rothbard for us in the present context:    the fundamental rule for deciding whether anyone, including the government, is justified in using force to make us do something we do not want to do is the nonaggression principle  nap . as murray put in in  war, peace, and the state,   no one may threaten or commit violence   aggress   against another man is person or property. violence may be employed only against the man who commits such violence  that is, only defensively against the aggressive violence of another. in short, no violence may be employed against a nonaggressor.     you might at first think that you can use the nap to justify forced quarantines against the coronavirus. suppose someone had a deadly disease that would always spread to others if he came in contact with them. probably the person would want to isolate himself and not infect others, but if he refused, would not the people in danger be justified in isolating him  he is a threat to others, even if he does not intend to harm them.     thinking about this case can lead us astray, and here is where murray can help us most. in his great book the ethics of liberty, he says,  it is important to insist, however, that the threat of aggression be palpable, immediate, and direct, in short, that it be embodied in the initiation of an overt act. any remote or indirect criterion--any  risk  or nothreat --is simply an excuse for invasive action by the supposed wouldefender  against the alleged nothreat.   murray hammers home the point later in the book. he says,  once one can use force against someone because of his  risky  activities, the sky is the limit, and there is virtually no limit to aggression against the rights of others. once permit someone is  fear  of the  risky  activities of others to lead to coercive action, then any tyranny becomes justified.     when we apply what murray says to the coronavirus situation, we can answer our question about forced quarantines. people are not threatening others with immediate death by contagion. rather, if you have the disease, you might pass it on to others. or you might not. what happens if someone gets the disease is also uncertain.   bourne  whom one might peg in the less  paleo  camp  also comments on the covid-19 issue as well  on apr 6 :    the longer lockdowns go on, the more the income losses for businesses and households turn into bankruptcies and defaults, risking a depression. so economists recognise that the costs and benefits of policy will change over time. they will look for ways of maintaining low health risks but at lower economic and social cost than crude shutdowns, recognising this balance changes as the pandemic evolves.    indeed, once the transmission rate has been brought down and more people recover from the virus, the calculations could change drastically. if i were one of the last 50 people in the whole country to have not yet been infected, i would not expect a destructive national lockdown to protect me. so, clearly, there comes a point when it is better to relax things from an economic welfare perspective. that could come much sooner than we think.   interestingly, it still considers a/the notion of welfare to society as a whole as relevant... but in view of how much  herd  immunity there is... which actually is quite to the similar argument from the opening quote i gave in this answer.   and it is easy to get sucked into the myriad variation of responses to covid-19 of us libertarian writers/personalities/politicians  thus make this answer way too long , but i will mention here anyway that ron paul  who ran for president on a libertarian party ticket at one point , has called  april 10  for fauci to be fired because  according to paul  fauci infringed on american liberties by overestimating the number of potential deaths from covid-19.      ...  they made these dire predictions so that they could go ahead and destroy peoples  civil liberties and spend a lot of money and make up an excuse on why the stock market actually went down -- all kinds of things by having this coronavirus event blown way out of proportion,  mr. paul said.  he should be fired,  mr. paul said about dr. fauci.  ...    personality polemics aside, it seems that in most libertarian discourse the probability of infection  and death  needs to be considered, so it is not too different from how others approach the matter, but perhaps the probability is  subjectively    tuned down  at least in some us libertarian discourse. however, the most hardcore/paleo libertarians seem to reject that quantines could ever be justified.

I am a healthy person but with weight issues, according to the standard weight tables. 

Can my immune system cure me by itself? That is, without the need of medications or drugs? and by only resting and eating healthy?

  If you’re young and healthy with only mild symptoms, your doctor will likely advise you to isolate yourself at home and to limit contact with others in your household. You’ll likely be advised to rest, stay well hydrated, and to closely monitor your symptoms.


then it says


  If your symptoms worsen with home care, it’s important to get prompt medical care.


Here, Why could symptoms worsen?
","
  If you’re young and healthy with only mild symptoms, your doctor will likely advise you to isolate yourself at home and to limit contact with others in your household. You’ll likely be advised to rest, stay well hydrated, and to closely monitor your symptoms.


This means that if you have mild symptoms, yes, you will eventually ""cure"" yourself, the same way you would recover from a typical common cold, or how a healthy individual would typically handle influenza.


  If your symptoms worsen with home care, it’s important to get prompt medical care.


This means if you have bad symptoms, then home care is not enough, and you need the assistance that a hospital can provide. There is still no cure that medical care can provide; instead, the purpose of getting care is to prevent your symptoms from killing you before your immune system can handle the infection on its own. For some this includes mechanical ventilation: using a machine to help you breathe.
","This study did a thorough literature search of all existing Aloe Vera research and found, at best, weak conclusions:


  The current evidence suggests some potential benefit of Aloe vera in improving glycaemic control in prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. However, given the limitations of the available evidence and the high heterogeneity in study results, high-quality, well-powered randomized controlled trials using standardized preparations are needed to quantify any beneficial effects of Aloe vera on glycaemic control.


On that basis, I am not sure if your premise (Aloe Vera helps in decreasing blood sugar in patients with diabetes) holds true. I do not know of any study that has actually identified helpful substances in Aloe Vera for diabetes and do not think there is any [study].

Diabetes as a disease seems to attract crackpots and crackpot theories. I have a child with Type 1 Diabetes. Every month I must meet 4-5 people who come to me with ridiculous theories and substances that will cure diabetes or improve it: cinnamon, coriander, beet juice, dried mango, pineapple, ""natural substances that reverse diabetes."" It is an experience common to all of us, parents of children with diabetes or people with diabetes: just look at how mocking savvy diabetes forums are towards the diabetes diet of the day. 

The sad truth is that there is nothing. For Type 1s, insulin is the only thing that can help. Many Type 2s will be helped by diet, exercise and some oral medicines -- but, for most of them, they will eventually graduate to insulin too. In fact, that would be true for all of them -- except that some will die of something else first.

293,expert,academia.stackexchange.com,"I am a master student expected to graduate in April. I want to work as an R/A for my thesis advisor after graduation and want to do a PhD afterwards. However, the entire school is closed and I cannot meet him in person. When I asked him about meeting after the corona is over, he said “don't worry about graduation, you will be able to graduate online”. It seems that he does not want to meet me, which makes me feel very depressed and anxious. My only option now is to write an email. I want to talk with him over several things:


Is my thesis good enough that justifies doing a PhD? If yes, is it possible that I publish it with him being coauthor?
Is it possible I become his R/a? Even if my thesis is good, that is not a guarantee.
What can I do to improve PhD chance?
Will he write me a letter of recommendation?


I think that asking all of these in one email is not a good idea. So I am thinking to start it with the email:


  Dear Prof.A, I am very grateful for your advices for my thesis.
  Without you I would not have been able to graduate. I learned a lot
  from you and now that the thesis is finished, I discovered my passion

  “don't worry about graduation, you will be able to graduate online”


In this context, I would translate your advisor's thought process as:


  This student sounds like they are anxious and worried about graduation. The best way I can help them worry less is to simply tell them not to worry.


Nothing there about wanting to meet or not. Indeed, if your advisor does not want to meet in person, it's more likely to stay out of the public and help contribute to reducing disease spread.

I think it's fine to write an email with some bullet points about things you'd like to discuss further. Thank them for reassuring you about graduation, but make it clear that there are in fact things you could use advice on besides just a path to graduating.

Then you can ask whether the professor would prefer to discuss those things over email, to meet via phone or video chat (like Skype, Google Hangouts), or to meet in person.

Be as patient as you can be, because this is likely a stressful time for everyone. Your advisor may not be able to meet or respond right away - don't let that worry you.
","Preliminary remark: There are differing opinions on the important of the GRE in admissions to postgraduate programs, and its weight largely depends on the preferences of the academics making admission decisions.  Some regard the GRE general test as useful information, and take it into account, and some regard it as unimportant.  Meta-analysis of the predictive validity of the GRE can be found in Kuncel et al (2001).  Nothing in this answer should be read as implying that the GRE is determinative of entry, but if you are going to submit scores on this test, or if you are required to do this, it is good if your scores compare favourably to your cohort of applicants.



Assessing your score relative to your field of study: Assessing your score on the general GRE test can be done by comparing your score to data on the scores of test-takers, broken down by their intended graduate major.  Unsurprisingly, different fields have applicants with different levels of ability in the three sections of the GRE general test.  A score that would be considered good in some fields will be considered weak in other fields, depending on the average standard of applicants to that field.  Hence, it is important to look at your scores relative to the cohort of test-takers with your intended graduate major.

The Educational Testing Service (ETS) have published test data for test-takers (seniors and non-enrolled college graduates) who undertook the general GRE test in Financial Years 2014-17.  This data shows score outcomes for each group, based on their intended graduate major.  This data can be used as a reference to check how your score compares to other students who are intending to pursue the same graduate major as you.  It can also be used by academics to help them to interpret your score.  (ETS also produce annual 'snapshots' of score outcomes that give information on the scores across demographics and majors.)

If you would like to get a good idea of whether your GRE score compares favourably with your cohort (students seeking admission to study the same postgraduate major), the simplest thing to do is to compare your result to the published data for students in that cohort.  The data gives score frequencies in bins, so it is not usually possible to obtain your exact percentile in the cohort, but it should be possible to see roughly where you fall in that cohort.  The data also give means and standard deviations for the scores, so it is possible to obtain a standardised score relative to the cohort.



Example: In this related question the test-taker was seeking entry to an applied maths graduate program, with GRE general test scores of VR 167 (98%), QR 161 (78%) and AW 5.0 (93%).  This can be compared with histograms of scores from this cohort taken from the aforementioned data (means and standard deviations are also given in the data):



If we place the scores of this student into the data for the cohort of test-takers seeking entry to an applied mathematics graduate program we see that his quantitative reasoning score is actually below average for this cohort, despite being substantially above average relative to all test-takers.  The standardised scores for this student (standard deviations above/below the mean) relative to this cohort is VR 1.875, QR -0.500, AW 1.875.

This result shows that this particular student has a lower quantitative reasoning score than the majority of the cohort, and so this is likely to be a weakness of the application (to the extent that GRE is considered).  This is unsurprising when considering the fact that applicants for mathematics programs tend to have extremely high levels of quantitative reasoning ability.

A vaccine for H1N1pdm09 was available in the fall of 2010.  It was possible to make it that quickly because it’s just another influenza strain, and the normal techniques for for vaccines against influenza strains worked fine.

Amazingly there is this paper published on the motions on Ants which says:


  The isotropic distribution of average speed appears as a surprising
  result since it would be expected, for instance, that ants progressing
  uphill should be slower than when moving downhill. For instance, Seidl
  et al. found lower speeds on steeper inclines in desert ants moving
  uphill, but indicate that desert ants progressing downhill displayed
  high velocities [42]. This is in contrast with our finding with Lasius
  niger in the present set-up where the velocity showed no dependency to
  the walking direction, even for the steepest inclination. However,
  Wohlgemuth et al. report, also in the desert ant, that speed was
  reduced in both their uphill and downhill channels (+540 ) compared to
  their flat channel, thereby excluding metabolic cost as a reliable
  means to gauge walked distance on various inclines [28]. In an attempt
  to determine the effects of inclination on the gross metabolic cost of
  locomotion in leaf-cutter ants, Holt &amp; Askew report that ants
  travelled the fastest on a horizontal plane, and indeed moderated
  their speed with the inclination, both on the incline and the decline.
  They suggest that ants adapt their behavior so as to keep their
  metabolic rate constant despite changing mechanical demands.

And sensible or not, I've heard this from a colleague, and it's confirmed by the news that Romania's capital Bucharest plans to randomly test a sample of 10,500 people to determine the extent of the virus spread over there.


  Manager of the “Matei Bals” Infectious Diseases Institute Adrian Streinu-Cercel has announced that a pilot project for testing 10,500 persons for the novel coronavirus will start in Bucharest within a scientific study to detect those infected with SARS CoV-2 virus, from the desire to thus prevent the severe forms of illness.
  
  Streinu-Cercel mentioned that, for a population of approximately 2 million inhabitants, the testing of 9,558 persons is necessary, with a correction of 10% being applied to this number. He also stated that the sample can be resized along the way. In this regard, Streinu-Cercel referred to the recommendations of the World Health Organization, which asked that testing be conducted to detect COVID 19. The manager of the “Matei Bals” Institute showed that it is necessary to test the medical staff and patients, but also the population, in order to know if “it’s healthy, if it is currently infected or went through the infection” with this virus, these three pieces of information completely changing how this pandemic is approached in the near future. [...]
  
  Streinu-Cercel underscored that, in lack of screening, the mild forms can go undetected, generating subsequent forms of severe infections. He also mentioned that the Minister of Health approved this project and stressed that this is a study with “scientific value,” not a simple testing. At the same time, he mentioned that in Bucharest there are 188 people diagnosed positively.


Note that ~200 cases in 2M is 1:10,000.

Ha, ha, the more amusing part is that this turned out to be ""fake news!"" But it's actually informative to read the ""retraction/information"" as to why they are not actually doing such a study [obviously: insufficient testing capacity for the proposed sample.]


  After the manager of the “Matei Bals” Institute for Infectious Diseases, Adrian Streinu-Cercel and Bucharest mayor Gabriela Firea had announced on Thursday that 10,514 people from 5 different age groups in Bucharest will be tested for the novel Coronavirus, PM Ludovic Orban reacted and said this is not possible.
  
  “We cannot establish the people to be tested randomly. Selecting 10,000 are just stories, there is a priority list for testing, it depends on how the situation and the testing capacity are developing,” the PM told a conference at the Health Ministry’s HQs.
  
  Orban said that the medical staff and those targeted by the epidemiological inquiries are qualifying for testing first, adding that “Romania has not been ready and the testing capacity has been limited”.
  
  The premier said that “the testing capacity in Romania will increase up to 2,000 next week” and will gradually rise, but to select 10,000 people “are just stories”, the more the death toll has been low in Romania.


In older news I see that India conducted a random test on 500 of their citizens. Rather predictably, they all came out negative.

By the way, if what you want to find out are the proportion of asymptomatic cases, there are some studies (albeit on fairly contained populations) that may have an answer to that, e.g. one on the Diamond Princess (the cruise ship quarantined off Japan):


  [Overall:] Our estimated asymptomatic proportion is at 17.9% (95%CrI: 15.5–20.2%), which overlaps with a recently derived estimate of 33.3% (95% confidence interval: 8.3–58.3%) from data of Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan.
  
  [Caveat:] Considering that most of the passengers were 60 years and older, the nature of the age distribution may lead to underestimation if older individuals tend to experience more symptoms. 


From a 2nd study on the Diamond Princess, it's informative to read the testing strategy/order:


  Overall 3,063 PCR tests were performed among [the 3,711] passengers and crew members. Testing started among the elderly passengers, descending by age.

Protein isn't just a calorie source.  It's an essential macronutrient that participates in a huge range of metabolic processes.  The protein-free diet you're proposing is likely to cause protein-energy malnutrition, and possibly other deficiency syndromes never seen before -- I don't think anyone's ever made a serious study of a diet entirely lacking in protein.

Your proposed casein-supplimented rations might get around this, but it strikes me as a rather pointless and expensive exercise -- my local food bank claims it can feed a person a varied first-world diet for $0.60 per day; other donation drives claim things like a Thanksgiving dinner for $0.78.
","italy has 60 million people and around 70 thousand  known  cases. that is barely more than 1 in 1000 prevalence. for most countries it is less than this. so, you would need a huge sample for a good estimate. and those tests/resources are better deployed where suspected cases are, for the time being.  and sensible or not, i have heard this from a colleague, and it is confirmed by the news that romania is capital bucharest plans to randomly test a sample of 10,500 people to determine the extent of the virus spread over there.    manager of the  matei bals  infectious diseases institute adrian streinu-cercel has announced that a pilot project for testing 10,500 persons for the novel coronavirus will start in bucharest within a scientific study to detect those infected with sars cov-2 virus, from the desire to thus prevent the severe forms of illness.    streinu-cercel mentioned that, for a population of approximately 2 million inhabitants, the testing of 9,558 persons is necessary, with a correction of 10  being applied to this number. he also stated that the sample can be resized along the way. in this regard, streinu-cercel referred to the recommendations of the world health organization, which asked that testing be conducted to detect covid 19. the manager of the  matei bals  institute showed that it is necessary to test the medical staff and patients, but also the population, in order to know if  it is healthy, if it is currently infected or went through the infection  with this virus, these three pieces of information completely changing how this pandemic is approached in the near future.  ...     streinu-cercel underscored that, in lack of screening, the mild forms can go undetected, generating subsequent forms of severe infections. he also mentioned that the minister of health approved this project and stressed that this is a study with  scientific value,  not a simple testing. at the same time, he mentioned that in bucharest there are 188 people diagnosed positively.   note that  200 cases in 2m is 1:10,000.  ha, ha, the more amusing part is that this turned out to be  fake news   but it is actually informative to read the  retraction/information  as to why they are not actually doing such a study  obviously: insufficient testing capacity for the proposed sample.     after the manager of the  matei bals  institute for infectious diseases, adrian streinu-cercel and bucharest mayor gabriela firea had announced on thursday that 10,514 people from 5 different age groups in bucharest will be tested for the novel coronavirus, pm ludovic orban reacted and said this is not possible.     we cannot establish the people to be tested randomly. selecting 10,000 are just stories, there is a priority list for testing, it depends on how the situation and the testing capacity are developing,  the pm told a conference at the health ministry is hqs.    orban said that the medical staff and those targeted by the epidemiological inquiries are qualifying for testing first, adding that  romania has not been ready and the testing capacity has been limited .    the premier said that  the testing capacity in romania will increase up to 2,000 next week  and will gradually rise, but to select 10,000 people  are just stories , the more the death toll has been low in romania.   in older news i see that india conducted a random test on 500 of their citizens. rather predictably, they all came out negative.  by the way, if what you want to find out are the proportion of asymptomatic cases, there are some studies  albeit on fairly contained populations  that may have an answer to that, e.g. one on the diamond princess  the cruise ship quarantined off japan :     overall:  our estimated asymptomatic proportion is at 17.9   95 cri: 15.5-20.2  , which overlaps with a recently derived estimate of 33.3   95  confidence interval: 8.3-58.3   from data of japanese citizens evacuated from wuhan.     caveat:  considering that most of the passengers were 60 years and older, the nature of the age distribution may lead to underestimation if older individuals tend to experience more symptoms.    from a 2nd study on the diamond princess, it is informative to read the testing strategy/order:    overall 3,063 pcr tests were performed among  the 3,711  passengers and crew members. testing started among the elderly passengers, descending by age.

For people who have not filed a 2018 or 2019 tax return and do not receive Social Security or railroad retirement benefits, there is an incentive to promptly file a tax return to ensure that the IRS can reach them to distribute the money to them this year. 

People who do not file tax returns are typically low-income. For example, the IRS requires married couples with both spouses under 65 to file returns for 2019 if their gross income was at least $24,400. That threshold is raised to $27,000 in cases where both spouses were 65 or older.

The vast majority of those cases, 78,064, are in mainland China, and most of those are in Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak.
But officials are increasingly worried about South Korea, where the number of cases has climbed from just a handful to more than 1,200 in the last week or so. An outbreak in Italy has infected 322 people, a worrying sign that the virus may be gaining a foothold in Europe. Seven other European nations confirmed new cases of the virus overnight. And an outbreak in Iran has infected more than 100 residents.
“The sudden increases in cases in Italy, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Korea are deeply concerning,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday.
The Iranian outbreak has spawned new cases in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman; the Italian outbreak is now linked to cases in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Germany, Spain and Switzerland.
Tuesday marked a sobering moment for epidemiologists watching the virus: It was the first day that more new cases were confirmed in countries besides China than new cases in China itself, according to the WHO.
There have been 57 cases diagnosed in the United States, 36 of whom were repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.

","First, let's define retrograde amnesia carefully. You'll find many sources listing drugs that cause retrograde amnesia but they're using the term incorrectly.

From http://www.human-memory.net/disorders_retrograde.html:


  Retrograde amnesia is a form of amnesia where someone is unable to
  recall events that occurred before the development of the amnesia,
  even though they may be able to encode and memorize new things that
  occur after the onset.


With that definition in mind, I don't think drugs exist that cause retrograde amnesia for the past few days, much less years. Some drugs will create retrograde amnesia for memories formed minutes before administration, but not much longer than that. This is believed to be because they interfere with the memory formation process, which is still incomplete when the drug is taken.

Long term alcohol abuse can cause retrograde amnesia, but that's due to the brain damage it causes after long-term abuse. No single binge, even a long one, will cause retrograde amnesia if the abuse is short-lived.

There are animal experiments that have produced retrograde amnesia by administering agents directly to the brain, but that's not something a doctor can give you. They may lead to such drugs in the future, but they're not available yet.

There are several drugs that can prevent new memories from being formed such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and anesthesia agents such as propofol, but they all work by preventing new memories from being formed while under influence of the drug. They don't wipe out memories formed before the drug was taken and therefore can't be said to cause retrograde amnesia.

So, basically, true retrograde amnesia is usually due to brain damage from agents such as dementia, trauma, stroke, infection, prolonged seizures, and long-term substance abuse. There are no drugs a doctor can give you that will accomplish this.

431,general,politics.stackexchange.com,"Wikipedia lets us know that:


  A Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) is a formal declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO) of ""an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response"", formulated when a situation arises that is ""serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected"", which ""carries implications for public health beyond the affected state's national border"" and ""may require immediate international action"". Under the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR), states have a legal duty to respond promptly to a PHEIC.
  
  [...]
  
  On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19, centered on Wuhan in central China, a PHEIC. [...]


It's unclear to me from that if a WHO PHEIC declaration (and thus the obligations following from that) are limited to an area or country that the WHO decides ""to PHEIC"" or is a PHEIC declaration on some concern, e.g. this-or-that-disease ""is PHEIC'd"" automatically entails that all IHR member countries have to respond similarly, e.g. report [all] cases of that disease. So what's the (geographical) scope of a PHEIC? Does the WHO have the latitude to ""customize it""?
","A PHEIC declaration does not apply to a specific area - it is just that, a declaration by the WHO that the Directory-General has determined that a public health emergency of international concern exists pursuant to Article 12 of the International Health Regulation (2005). Paragraph 5 of Article 12 states that


  If the Director-General, following consultations with the State Party
  within whose territory the public health emergency of international
  concern has occurred, considers that a public health emergency of
  international concern has ended, the Director-General shall take a
  decision in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 49.


Paragraph 6 of Article 49 states that 


  The Director-General shall communicate to States Parties the
  determination and the termination of a public health emergency of
  international concern, any health measure taken by the State Party
  concerned, any temporary recommendation, and the modification,
  extension and termination of such recommendations, together with the
  views of the Emergency Committee.


Here, States Parties refers to all state parties to the IHR - so any declaration of a PHEIC is therefore applicable globally, and obligates state parties to notify the WHO of any local spread of the disease. Notably, the declaration of a disease to be a PHEIC does not actually introduce new obligations to state parties directly, but as states are required under Article 6 to


  notify WHO, by the most efficient means of communication available, by
  way of the National IHR Focal Point, and within 24 hours of assessment
  of public health information, of all events which may constitute a
  public health emergency of international concern within its territory
  in accordance with the decision instrument, as well as any health
  measure implemented in response to those events


the designation of the disease to be a PHEIC means that the event is notifiable, and as a result, the declaration of a PHEIC affects all state parties by definition.

However, if we refer back to Article 49, note that the Director-General is obligated to communicate temporary recommendations with regard to public health. These temporary recommendations are non-binding and time-limited, and are described further in Article 15, paragraph 2 of which states that


  Temporary recommendations may include health measures to be
  implemented by the State Party experiencing the public health
  emergency of international concern, or by other States Parties,
  regarding persons, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods
  and/or postal parcels to prevent or reduce the international spread of
  disease and avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic.


Therefore, these temporary recommendations need not be globally applicable, and can apply to just one, or a few state parties.

In conclusion then, while the declaration of a PHEIC is applicable globally, the temporary recommendations issued as a result of the declaration are not required to be, and in general, aren't.
","Most classical liberals respect property rights as the foundation of a liberal economy. One definition of a property right is a state granted monopoly on the use of an object.

Many consider John Locke the founder of classical liberalism. In a Lockean state of nature (see chapter two), people gain property rights by taking the unimproved land and putting themselves into it through labor. Once they have done this, they have a right to the land. They can voluntarily decide who enters it.

Copyright law is very similar to this Lockean viewpoint. I took unused words and put my labor into it to create a story. I now have mastery over this story and may decide who uses it. 

Copyright law, however, has many difficulties. 


What if two people write the same book independently? What if someone
else's book is just very similar?  
How does copying your book harm
you? What about my right to do whatever I want on my property?


But land ownership also has many unclear difficulties as well.


Can I play my music very loudly if it enters your land? Exactly how
loud? What about my right to do whatever I want on my property? 
What if I take the oil beneath your land while only drilling on my land?
Can I go on your land at night or if you're not there? What if I'm
very quiet and respectfully leave as soon as I see you? How does that
harm you?


Based on their similar origins and a broadly similar level of difficulty in defining and enforcing, it is reasonable that a classical liberal could find copyright law an acceptable form of property rights.

315,expert,academia.stackexchange.com,"Disclaimer: My PhD supervisor, while not a bad person, is a bad mentor and has given me bad advice in the past. So discussing this with him isn't really productive. I have talked to other people in real life about this, and the opinion of this community would also be welcome.

I'm set to finish my PhD in theoretical physics in September 2020. I applied to several postdocs, got three interviews, and in one I was rated among the top choices but, in the end, I didn't secure any position.

I don't know how similar this is to the fields, but for context I'll explain how postdoc appointments work in (edit: high energy) theoretical physics. In my field, postdoc applications run in cycles. The majority have roughly the same application periods and deadlines (around November), most offers are made at the same time (early January following year) and they all start roughly at the same time (September). There's the occasional outlier, but that's the basic pattern. This means that it's more or less hopeless that I can continue looking for a position, ask professors, etc, for September 2020. If I wanted to stay in academia, I would need to look for a postdoc in the next cycle, starting September 2021.

I am unsure how realistic it is for me to try again or if I should simply throw the towel and quit academia.


First, there's the issue of staying one year academically idle (obviously not professionally idle, that would be insane). I could work on leftover projects from my PhD on my free time, but between finishing my PhD in September 2020 and the deadline for the next cycle on November 2020, that leaves very little time to do so. 
Second, how do I even explain the gap in my cover letter? If I flat out say I failed the previous application cycle, it's a guaranteed trip to the garbage can. Some people have recommended me just lying in vague terms, like I didn't pursue a postdoc immediately after completing my PhD due to ""health concerns that have since been resolved"". I'm unsure if this is a good idea...


If anyone has any other advice regarding my situation besides these two concerns I've raised, that would be welcome too. Basically, I would like to stay in academia as a first preference, but I have no desire to bang my head against the wall against something that, at this point, might be very close to impossible. I don't have any preference for country to work in, so feel free to give country-specific advice.
","1) First the bad news: The job situation (tenure track) in theoretical high energy physics is not good, covid will not help, having a hard time to get a first postdoc is not a good sign. Having difficulty to get a postdoc is probably not your fault. There are many possible reasons, such as field not a good match, advisor not helpful, institution not a good match. However, it is not clear that the situation will be different next year. 

2) In the past it has been quite uncommon for people to work in the private sector and then return to academia. If it is just a year then you can probably finish another paper or two from your graduate work, and describe your stint as gaining real world experience. I don't think it is true that people will just discard your application, but it does not improve it, either. 

3) The good news is that suddenly there does appear to be a new track. If you are interested in machine learning or quantum information then you can try to get a private sector job in this area, and that does leave open the possibility of returning to academia after you have gained some experience (after two years, for example, or even later than that).
","You should note that the word ""editor"" is used in many ways for quite different things. Most people understand it to mean ""someone who makes changes/edits to the text"". But that isn't how it is necessarily used. While the publishing industry does, in fact, employ people who do that, working with an author to improve the text, it usually means someone with some management responsibility. 

In the case of your paper, I suspect that a ""managing editor"" (a manager) has assigned your paper to a lower level ""subject editor"" (or some similar term) whose main responsibility is to track the progress of the paper through the system. He or she will find reviewers, track their progress, and collect reviews. When all reviews are in, that ""editor"" will make a recommendation to some higher level ""editor"" about whether to accept or not. If the overall decision is to accept, then your subject editor may assign someone to work with the author on improving the text - a traditional editor. 

I used the term ""subject editor"", not because it is a term of use, but because it describes someone who actually knows a bit about the subject of the paper and which reviewers would be good for getting advice. This is most likely the ""editor"" that the system is referring to. It means, roughly, ""we are handling it and progress is being made"". 

See the Scholarly Books... section of this wikipedia article for the typical usages. ""Project editor"" = ""subject editor"".

No. The simple reason why is that even if you buy immediately when the market opens, that's still too late.

As an example, imagine that there's a single ETF which trades both in the United States (from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm US Eastern time) and in Great Britain (from 4:30 am to 11:00 am US Eastern time).

Now let's imagine that it's 4:30 am Eastern, and the ETF begins trading at $80. However, the price of the ETF increases over the course of the day, so that by 9:25 am Eastern, the price of the ETF is $100.

Can you take advantage of this by buying shares of the ETF in the United States immediately upon open? No, because when it starts trading in the United States, it will start trading at about $100, not at $80. You'll be paying $100 for shares worth $100, which is, of course, a profit of $0.

Maybe you're thinking that when the market opens, the opening price is the same as the previous day's closing price. This is not the case. The market won't open at $80 and then immediately rise to $100; it will simply open at $100.

274,expert,academia.stackexchange.com,"Given the recent shutdowns of many universities across the world, there's an increased interest in online education techniques.

In my case, I am a TA for a quantum chemistry class, and I'm finding it daunting to transition to online teaching. At first, I got really excited because I thought of taking advantage of this situation to run a flipped discussion section: I'd record lectures in advance, and then have virtual office hours where students could Zoom/Skype/Google hangout with me and we discuss in the same chatroom (so everyone hears the conversation). 

However, in what I suspect to be an attempt to distance themselves from something nice and free/far cheaper (like edX) which has been doing this online routine for a long time, my university has required that we livestream our lectures/discussion sections. This is purportedly to be in the aim to make their online experience as college-like as possible, but it's problematic for multiple reasons. First, lectures are at 9AM EST... Do we expect students to tune in at 10 PM in Japan? Or 3 AM in Hawaii? 

Second, we should use the silver linings present in this university shutdown: video lectures = students get to go back and re-listen to a part that confused them! From my perspective, this university requirement goes against an attempt to maintain normalcy: normalcy should not be defined as continuation of the same daily routine (impossible for many), but rather a continuation of helpful instruction.

I intend to find out whom to email about this, but in the meantime, what resources/advice would you suggest for an instructor who suddenly has to transition to the digital classroom?
","This is marked for community ownership so constructive edits will be welcomed. It is, however, more directed at those who can design a course, rather than a TA who has limited control. 

Background

Many of the teaching techniques we use are not optimal for learning. They have been designed for economic efficiency since they scale. Some of them have been a bit obsolete since the creation of the internet. But face to face classes in real time are no longer necessary. Lecture is efficient (one teacher, many students, synchronous), but again, not optimal. Testing is a poor way to guarantee competence. This current emergency can be considered to be an opportunity to rethink everything we do toward finding better ways to educate people. We are forced to act and the old ways don't work in a new environment. We should be looking for new ways. 

The essentials of teaching are Delivery, Practice, Feedback, Assessment. All of these require Two Way Communication. They don't require synchronicity or exams. The first job is to teach people, not to grade them. If you get that part backwards then you are only ""teaching"" people who don't need to be taught. 

Every student is different. Nearly every student learns differently from the way their instructor does. The instructor has been proven to stand out in a particular system in which others have failed. As an instructor you have an obligation to every student willing to put in the effort, not just to the ones naturally predisposed to ""win"" in some system. Not every student starts at the same place with the same understandings. The same words don't necessarily have the same meanings to different people. 

Some people have handicaps that prevent certain kinds of interactions. Hearing impairment and vision impairment are obvious ones, but there are others. 

Learning is individual, but the process need not require isolation. It can be a communal process with learners helping each other. Denying students the option of working together is sub-optimal. A course can be a communal activity, not a hierarchical one. 

Some students will succeed no matter the system. They don't really need you for anything more than pointing to important sources/ideas. But most actually require your assistance since insight into a topic can be hard to come by. Many students actually need to be taught how to learn. If you change the system of learning they may need to be retaught how to internalize ideas and turn them into competencies. It isn't automatic or obvious. 

Learning isn't ""consuming"" material. It requires active participation. It requires a change in the brain (The Art of Changing the Brain by James E Zull)

All of these things have long been taken into account in designing educational systems, but the current practice is a compromise that values economic (scale) values over educational ones. Not everywhere, of course, but the exceptions seem few to me. 

Let's assume that everything is on the table, except that students and instructors can no longer meet face to face in groups. Meetings of any kind need to be small and optional with alternatives provided. Computer communication of some kind is needed, but costs are an issue as is the privacy of all participants. 

What to do, what to do. 

Ideas for Delivery

There are a lot of ways for students to have access to the material of a course. Books are traditional. Lecture has replaced most other methods. But lectures are longer than they need to be. Some research I read suggests that lectures of 10 to 15 minutes are more efficient than hour or longer lectures (https://spokenimpact.com/what-is-the-ideal-length-for-a-presentation/). Those contemplating video should take note of that. Video also needs to be accompanied with a transcript to aid those with impairments. 

Moreover, students need to be able to review material. Video is difficult in this regard since it is hard to quickly return to a small part that needs review without watching longer sections, which leads to boredom. Transcripts can mark the time that important ideas are introduced. 

There is a fine line between having good and poor production values in video. If they are too good, a video talk becomes just entertainment with poor learning, unless other means are used to encourage/enforce engagement. If they are too bad, then students will get lost and frustrated. Video professionals are good at this sort of thing, but it is hard to bootstrap immediately at scale.

Delivery alone is just media. Students need to incorporate what they see in a lecture, long or short, into their long term memory and into their effective competencies. More is involved than the eyes and ears. Students often think that the will automatically ""learn"" what is presented to them in a lecture, talk, demonstration, etc. but it is anything but automatic. 

Caveats: Any ""solution"" that requires real-time synchronous presence on the internet will probably fail. And it will fail invisibly for some. Connections are dropped, servers overload, etc. It is hard enough to keep students off their phone when in a class. It is probably impossible to do in a real-time internet lecture. Other distractions will intrude. Moreover, unless you have an exceptional communication system, students won't be able to interrupt you when you make a mistake, as you will. No questions are likely to be asked in real time. It is also difficult for a presenter to give a lively talk with no audience feedback at all. Especially if you are trying to do this under emergency conditions without training and experience.  

But if you absolutely must use synchronous delivery you need to do two additional things. The first is that you need to record and post your lectures so that those who must miss the original don't lose access. 

The second, just as vital, is that you provide a real time feedback to yourself (or to an assistant sitting by your side) so that questions can be asked as you lecture and so that students have a way to mention/note errors you make. 

And make sure that students know what to do in the case that you lose the server and the ability to broadcast. Avoid chaos and uncertainty as much as possible. 

Ideas for Practice

Student practice exercises and tasks may not need to change much. Students, depending on the field, need to write, solve problems, and other things as appropriate. For the most part this can probably proceed largely unchanged. Instructors have access to many such student exercises. If the students have a text book they probably have a bank of suitable exercises and questions. 

And note that practice and reinforcement is probably the most important element in a delivered education. The ""content"" that a student needs is, for the most part, available to them. There are exceptions for very advanced work, but the world's knowledge is pretty much available. Instructors help students choose the important things and avoid the garbage, of course, but it is up to the students themselves to learn by reinforcement (combined with feedback). Whatever the topic, competence comes from repetition and reinforcement. The only thing I teach nowadays is Tai Chi. We have a saying that you need to repeat a movement ten thousand times to learn it. Somewhere in those ten thousand tries, insight will start to develop. The same is true in things like mathematics and writing poetry. 

So, remember that the things that you make the students do to learn are much more important than the things you say. Good course design focuses on the student tasks, not the lectures. 

I caution, however, that copyright considerations may apply if an instructor tries to utilize exercises from copyrighted material. They are, in a sense, publishing things they send to students in an online course. Caution and legal advice is useful. 

Ideas for Feedback

Feedback is two way. You need feedback from the students on your presentations and assignments. Students need feedback on their own work. A number or letter grade on a paper isn't feedback. It gives no basis for understanding how to improve. 

If the materials presented are well vetted, such as textbooks, the need for feedback to the instructor is a bit lessened. But videos, especially those prepared in the moment are likely to contain errors. Shorter videos are easier to fix than longer ones. But, unlike face to face classes, the instructor isn't likely to be interrupted when there is a misstatement or an omission. Moreover, you need some indication that the students have actually understood what you have been saying and presenting. Again, in fact to face classes you can look at expressions on their faces for some important feedback. 

Lets assume for the moment that you have already taught your students the importance of taking notes during presentations. At the end of a lecture you can ask individual students, perhaps volunteers, to tell you an important idea from the talk. You can do this two or three times and give them feedback on their replies. This can be transferred to online learning. If readings or video presentations are short (and, I assume asynchronous) you can ask students to send you a summary of the lesson. Restrict them to one or two sentences. Another possible request is to ask them to send you a possible exam question on that material. At some point, all student replies, perhaps anonymized, can be made available to everyone. By glancing through the replies you learn whether they are getting the main points and they are also getting the reinforcement they need. 

Giving feedback to students on their work is critical to learning. This involves answering questions that they have, but also showing them where they are making mistakes, and why, in their own work. The previous section talked about repetition and reinforcement. It is possible for students to learn and reinforce the wrong message. If you get an incorrect idea deeply ingrained in your mind it can be difficult to dislodge. All student work needs to be commented on, not just graded. Publishing solutions to exercises after the fact can help, but it isn't the same thing. 

This idea of individual feedback is one of the most difficult things to arrange in the modern educational system, simply because of scale. My university teaching (and student life) mostly involved classes of fewer than 30 students. At that scale, I could easily give good individual feedback on weekly assignments. At 40 students I found I needed help. Massive courses have a problem here that requires tools - probably better tools than are now available. I'll note that Harvard's CS50 course is delivered to about 800 students at a time. But the staff for the course is about 40 individuals, so the ratio is about 20:1. Some of the staff are graders who comment on student work. Others are TAs who hold individual ""recitation"" sections of 20-30 students so that questions can be answered and misconceptions dispelled. I worry that moving such recitation online might not work as well at scale unless there are communication tools that let people learn from the questions of others. Many students are reluctant to ask questions. The brave students willing to do so actually contribute to the education of their peers. But, answering a question for a single student, say in an office, is much less productive than answering it in public, so that all can share the response. Tools are needed for this, though they can be pretty simple. University managed email lists subscribed to by students and staff are pretty effective. 

But if students produce ""papers"" of any kind, those need to be annotated and returned. More than a numeric or letter grade is needed. Something as simple as pointing a student to a place they need to review is helpful. But the goal is to foster insight. PDF files can be annotated and returned, but the process is awkward at best. And, again, there is the scale problem. It takes time to review and time to annotate. Then, the student will likely have questions that need to be addressed based on the annotations. The increase in awkwardness using current tools may require more staffing to make things work effectively. Even a simple email to a student takes more time than jotting a comment on a paper and then returning it at the next face session. 

Ideas for Assessment

In my view, evaluation and assessment are the most difficult issues we face in moving to an internet model. However, they also, again in my view, have the most potential for long term improvements in student learning, provided that we take the opportunity to learn how to do a better job of it. 

The first principle of assessment ought to be that any sort of evaluation have an actual educational purpose, not just a ""sorting"" purpose. I think that many of us aren't doing a stellar job of this, having opted for easy solutions that scale, rather than solutions that aid student learning. Multiple choice tests are overused and while it is possible to design good ones, it is devilishly difficult. Things that rely on machine grading in general are too likely to also rely on only shallow learning and memorization, rather than deep learning and mastery. If the students can be held in a room and closely monitored this sort of thing tells you something about them, but it can likely be better. Move them outside your purview and it becomes nearly impossible. And it even fails at scale. 

While you can do some technological things to lock up a student's personal computer they are intrusive but also ineffective. You can enlist a vast army of TAs to monitor student webcams (intrusive, again) but even there, what happens slightly off screen is invisible. Without such intrusive measures students have access to helpers both human and electronic. Closed-book, closed notes exams are probably a mistake in any case, but online they are difficult to impossible to monitor. There are too many inducements for students to break the rules to really assure validity. Honor codes, such as those of Dartmouth College do have a positive effect, but part of that effect is that the codes have been in place for half a century. 

I have some personal suggestions about alternatives to examinations and, especially, high stakes examinations such as finals that account for a large fraction of a students grade. I don't claim these are the only solutions, but am more interested in sparking thoughts about how we can do a better - more learning focused - job of evaluation and assessment. I implemented these more and more as my career progressed and I learned more about students and about learning. 

The first idea is to reduce the overall effect of any given exam or test. If you have forty small items you can get at least as good a picture of a student's progress as if you have only one or two large ones. Moreover, high stakes testing too often leads to poor student studying habits, such as cramming for exams and cheating. 

One technique I used toward the end was ""cumulative grading"". A course had 1000 points assigned to it and different student activities were ""worth"" a certain amount of points. A project might be 100 points. The result was evaluated (and commented on) and a certain number of points was awarded, perhaps 80. I also published the minimum number of points necessary for each letter grade, say 800 for a B. When a student accumulates enough points to ""earn"" the grade they desire they no longer need to do more. There was no risk. Another feature of it was that if the student wasn't satisfied with the points earned they could re-do the work and possibly earn additional points. Some limits were put in place, but they were generous. The philosophy behind it is ""You aren't in this course to prove to me that you don't need to be here."" But note that I could do this since the ratio of staff to students was good. This is hard to scale without help. 

The second main technique I used and can recommend is to make almost all assessment and evaluation based on student writings and projects, not examinations. And, if the nature of the course permits, use group projects primarily. For my courses the group size was usually between two and five. These groups can meet in cyberspace or, if location and other factors permit, they can meet face to face. The projects might be large or small. They can be graded once or often. Points can accumulate. It is the project that is graded, not the individuals, so everyone earns the same grade unless that is impossible. Peer evaluation is used to award bonus points or to solve issues of non-participation, etc. 

If there are a number of group projects students can move between groups if needed. But students also need to be taught how to run an effective group project. In the courses I taught, dividing up the work ""equally"" was always discouraged and if done, usually leads to poor outcomes. Students need to form teams, not just amalgamations of individuals. In CS this skill will be valued later in their careers. 

Also, peer evaluation has to be properly managed. Students don't ""grade"" one another. They comment on the contributions of a few or all of their team mates. ""Who was the most helpful team member? (or three top members) Why? What did they contribute? What was your own chief contribution?"" 

At a certain scale or with sufficient help you can easily determine who falls into which important grading groups. Who is excellent in all respects? Who shows promise? Who is getting by? Who is deficient? Who has failed? Elaborate point systems in which an 85 is somehow significantly different from an 87 have little real meaning in my opinion. 

To emphasize a point above. In many fields, even very technical ones, writing is an important skill. Writing essays on a given topic is good professional preparation for a budding mathematician. Exams can be replaced with such essays, lessening the needs for security and such. They seem to me to be much more value long term than skill at exams. But you can probably expect that students will hate it initially. 

The above, of course, are just ideas. But I found them to be more aligned with the teaching mission than the more traditional lecture and test. 

Ideas for Communication

To handle all of the above with online courses the main need is for effective communication between faculty and students and, I found, between students themselves. One goal is that what any student sees can be seen by any other student. 

Communication tools need not be complex or comprehensive. But they should permit asynchronous communication and should permit many-way communication. Threaded email lists are very useful and don't require extensive facilities. They can be private lists, managed by the university alleviating some privacy issues, open to only class members and staff. Documents can be distributed. Questions can be asked. Questions can be answered at any time of the day or night - even by other students. Someone needs to monitor these to make sure that misinformation is quickly corrected and that any rules about posting or not posting certain content are maintained. 

If project groups are long lived, then each group can have its own mailing list and can also use other tools they find for communication. 

Another useful tool is a group chatroom. Group chats can be held periodically, though the email lists were more useful for discussing course material. These are necessarily synchronous and so not every student might be able to ""attend"". But it is easy to capture the complete conversation as a text file and send it to everyone or post it on a course web site. 



My own expertise in this comes from helping to design and deliver a graduate program in which students met face to face only once a month for half a day per course. All work was done in groups (of about 5). Face time was only used for things that could not be done on line. We used simple tools for communication. All student-professor communication (other than personal things) was open to all students. Students could ask questions at any time and other students were encouraged to answer from their own expertise. The course was always live, every hour, every day. Questions got answered quickly, if not always perfectly. Students didn't get stuck. The goal was to build a learning community. That community has persisted past graduation. 



Minor updates only anticipated.

","“Grading on a curve” means that you select what percentage of grades you want to correspond to a given final grade. It’s entirely up to you how you choose the resulting mean grade using that system. If you want to make the mean a 60 or an 80 or anything else, that’s your call. Ultimately, though, the point of the curve is to avoid having “grades less than 50 are failing.”

presentations and assignments. students need feedback on their own work. a number or letter grade on a paper is not feedback. it gives no basis for understanding how to improve.   if the materials presented are well vetted, such as textbooks, the need for feedback to the instructor is a bit lessened. but videos, especially those prepared in the moment are likely to contain errors. shorter videos are easier to fix than longer ones. but, unlike face to face classes, the instructor is not likely to be interrupted when there is a misstatement or an omission. moreover, you need some indication that the students have actually understood what you have been saying and presenting. again, in fact to face classes you can look at expressions on their faces for some important feedback.   lets assume for the moment that you have already taught your students the importance of taking notes during presentations. at the end of a lecture you can ask individual students, perhaps volunteers, to tell you an important idea from the talk. you can do this two or three times and give them feedback on their replies. this can be transferred to online learning. if readings or video presentations are short  and, i assume asynchronous  you can ask students to send you a summary of the lesson. restrict them to one or two sentences. another possible request is to ask them to send you a possible exam question on that material. at some point, all student replies, perhaps anonymized, can be made available to everyone. by glancing through the replies you learn whether they are getting the main points and they are also getting the reinforcement they need.   giving feedback to students on their work is critical to learning. this involves answering questions that they have, but also showing them where they are making mistakes, and why, in their own work. the previous section talked about repetition and reinforcement. it is possible for students to learn and reinforce the wrong message. if you get an incorrect idea deeply ingrained in your mind it can be difficult to dislodge. all student work needs to be commented on, not just graded. publishing solutions to exercises after the fact can help, but it is not the same thing.   this idea of individual feedback is one of the most difficult things to arrange in the modern educational system, simply because of scale. my university teaching  and student life  mostly involved classes of fewer than 30 students. at that scale, i could easily give good individual feedback on weekly assignments. at 40 students i found i needed help. massive courses have a problem here that requires tools - probably better tools than are now available. i will note that harvard is cs50 course is delivered to about 800 students at a time. but the staff for the course is about 40 individuals, so the ratio is about 20:1. some of the staff are graders who comment on student work. others are tas who hold individual  recitation  sections of 20-30 students so that questions can be answered and misconceptions dispelled. i worry that moving such recitation online might not work as well at scale unless there are communication tools that let people learn from the questions of others. many students are reluctant to ask questions. the brave students willing to do so actually contribute to the education of their peers. but, answering a question for a single student, say in an office, is much less productive than answering it in public, so that all can share the response. tools are needed for this, though they can be pretty simple. university managed email lists subscribed to by students and staff are pretty effective.   but if students produce  papers  of any kind, those need to be annotated and returned. more than a numeric or letter grade is needed. something as simple as pointing a student to a place they need to review is helpful. but the goal is to foster insight. pdf files can be annotated and returned, but the process is awkward at best. and, again, there is the scale problem. it takes time to review and time to annotate. then, the student will likely have questions that need to be addressed based on the annotations. the increase in awkwardness using current tools may require more staffing to make things work effectively. even a simple email to a student takes more time than jotting a comment on a paper and then returning it at the next face session.   ideas for assessment  in my view, evaluation and assessment are the most difficult issues we face in moving to an internet model. however, they also, again in my view, have the most potential for long term improvements in student learning, provided that we take the opportunity to learn how to do a better job of it.   the first principle of assessment ought to be that any sort of evaluation have an actual educational purpose, not just a  sorting  purpose. i think that many of us are not doing a stellar job of this, having opted for easy solutions that scale, rather than solutions that aid student learning. multiple choice tests are overused and while it is possible to design good ones, it is devilishly difficult. things that rely on machine grading in general are too likely to also rely on only shallow learning and memorization, rather than deep learning and mastery. if the students can be held in a room and closely monitored this sort of thing tells you something about them, but it can likely be better. move them outside your purview and it becomes nearly impossible. and it even fails at scale.   while you can do some technological things to lock up a student is personal computer they are intrusive but also ineffective. you can enlist a vast army of tas to monitor student webcams  intrusive, again  but even there, what happens slightly off screen is invisible. without such intrusive measures students have access to helpers both human and electronic. closed-book, closed notes exams are probably a mistake in any case, but online they are difficult to impossible to monitor. there are too many inducements for students to break the rules to really assure validity. honor codes, such as those of dartmouth college do have a positive effect, but part of that effect is that the codes have been in place for half a century.   i have some personal suggestions about alternatives to examinations and, especially, high stakes examinations such as finals that account for a large fraction of a students grade. i do not claim these are the only solutions, but am more interested in sparking thoughts about how we can do a better - more learning focused - job of evaluation and assessment. i implemented these more and more as my career progressed and i learned more about students and about learning.   the first idea is to reduce the overall effect of any given exam or test. if you have forty small items you can get at least as good a picture of a student is progress as if you have only one or two large ones. moreover, high stakes testing too often leads to poor student studying habits, such as cramming for exams and cheating.   one technique i used toward the end was  cumulative grading . a course had 1000 points assigned to it and different student activities were  worth  a certain amount of points. a project might be 100 points. the result was evaluated  and commented on  and a certain number of points was awarded, perhaps 80. i also published the minimum number of points necessary for each letter grade, say 800 for a b. when a student accumulates enough points to  earn  the grade they desire they no longer need to do more. there was no risk. another feature of it was that if the student was not satisfied with the points earned they could re-do the work and possibly earn additional points. some limits were put in place, but they were generous. the philosophy behind it is  you are not in this course to prove to me that you do not need to be here.  but note that i could do this since the ratio of staff to students was good. this is hard to scale without help.   the second main technique i used and can recommend is to make almost all assessment and evaluation based on student writings and projects, not examinations. and, if the nature of the course permits, use group projects primarily. for my courses the group size was usually between two and five. these groups can meet in cyberspace or, if location and other factors permit, they can meet face to face. the projects might be large or small. they can be graded once or often. points can accumulate. it is the project that is graded, not the individuals, so everyone earns the same grade unless that is impossible. peer evaluation is used to award bonus points or to solve issues of non-participation, etc.   if there are a number of group projects students can move between groups if needed. but students also need to be taught how to run an effective group project. in the courses i taught, dividing up the work  equally  was always discouraged and if done, usually leads to poor outcomes. students need to form teams, not just amalgamations of individuals. in cs this skill will be valued later in their careers.   also, peer evaluation has to be properly managed. students do not  grade  one another. they comment on the contributions of a few or all of their team mates.  who was the most helpful team member   or three top members  why  what did they contribute  what was your own chief contribution     at a certain scale or with sufficient help you can easily determine who falls into which important grading groups. who is excellent in all respects  who shows promise  who is getting by  who is deficient  who has failed  elaborate point systems in which an 85 is somehow significantly different from an 87 have little real meaning in my opinion.   to emphasize a point above. in many fields, even very technical ones, writing is an important skill. writing essays on a given topic is good professional preparation for a budding mathematician. exams can be replaced with such essays, lessening the needs for security and such. they seem to me to be much more value long term than skill at exams. but you can probably expect that students will hate it initially.   the above, of course, are just ideas. but i found them to be more aligned with the teaching mission than the more traditional lecture and test.   ideas for communication  to handle all of the above with online courses the main need is for effective communication between faculty and students and, i found, between students themselves. one goal is that what any student sees can be seen by any other student.   communication tools need not be complex or comprehensive. but they should permit asynchronous communication and should permit many-way communication. threaded email lists are very useful and do not require extensive facilities. they can be private lists, managed by the university alleviating some privacy issues, open to only class members and staff. documents can be distributed. questions can be asked. questions can be answered at any time of the day or night - even by other students. someone needs to monitor these to make sure that misinformation is quickly corrected and that any rules about posting or not posting certain content are maintained.   if project groups are long lived, then each group can have its own mailing list and can also use other tools they find for communication.   another useful tool is a group chatroom. group chats can be held periodically, though the email lists were more useful for discussing course material. these are necessarily synchronous and so not every student might be able to  attend . but it is easy to capture the complete conversation as a text file and send it to everyone or post it on a course web site.     my own expertise in this comes from helping to design and deliver a graduate program in which students met face to face only once a month for half a day per course. all work was done in groups  of about 5 . face time was only used for things that could not be done on line. we used simple tools for communication. all student-professor communication  other than personal things  was open to all students. students could ask questions at any time and other students were encouraged to answer from their own expertise. the course was always live, every hour, every day. questions got answered quickly, if not always perfectly. students did not get stuck. the goal was to build a learning community. that community has persisted past graduation.     minor updates only anticipated.     an interesting alternative view can be found here: http://anygoodthing.com/2020/03/12/please-do-a-bad-job-of-putting-your-courses-online/. thanks to user curious for pointing

613,general,travel.stackexchange.com,"I am trying to travel to Austria from Brussels by train, and have conflicting information on the status of cancellations due to Covid-19.

According to Eurail, ""all rail services from Germany to Austria are cancelled until further notice""
https://www.eurail.com/en/help/travel-disruptions/coronavirus-update

Yet, Deutsche Bahn and the 'trainline.eu' both allow me to book high-speed ICE trains across the border, just not the Nightjet trains. There are notices saying that there are delays/reduced services expected at the border, but it is not impossible to book like it is for other trains.

My questions:


does this mean that it is still possible to take the high-speed ICE trains?
if not, is there any other way that it is permitted to travel over the German border to Austria (e.g. by bus, coach or taxi)? Unfortunately driving is not an option.

","The official website of Deutsche Bahn lists the current interruptions due to corona (only in german, trying to change the language to english took me back to the main page):

According to this site, several trains between Germany and Austria have been cancelled, including the NightJet, but I assume that other trains are still running. Since the site doesn't mention ICE trains between Germany and Austria, I assume they are still running.

In case the trains stop running before you make it to Austria: If you are eligible to enter Austria, nothing should stop you from entering by taxi (or, taking a taxi to the german side of the border, crossing the border by foot, ordering another taxi to pick you up at the austrian side of the border) - but depending on how close to the border you can get by train this can be quite expensive. 

I wouldn't count on buses or coaches: They have never been quite as popular as trains, and the one company that offered (more or less) regular coach services - Flixbus - stopped operations tonight due to corona.

113,biomedical,health.stackexchange.com,"I would like to have a confusing part of medicine cleared up. My experience of medical intervention is as follows.


As pointed out in the answer to Does taking antibiotics make you immune to virus? antibiotics do not work on viruses.
If I go to a doctor when suffering from the common cold, I am told to ride it out and take paracetamol for aches and pains. That makes sense as the common cold is caused by a virus.
If visiting the doctor because a chest infection arises however, a course of antibiotics is often prescribed.


How does a doctor manage to determine that the chest infection is a bacterial infection rather than a viral infection from the common cold virus?

If the bacterial infection arose out of a common cold infection, why is it the bacterial infection occurred and not a viral infection?
","This is actually a pretty complicated question because viral infections can damage the lungs in a way that makes subsequent bacterial infections possible/likely and it's often these that are fatal. So if co-occurring both may need to be treated, with different medications, or the viral infection may be ignored sometimes. It basically depends on the severity of the pneumonia (which I'm guessing it's what you mean by ""chest infection""). For some background on causes of pneumonia:


  Pneumonia is an infection of the lung that causes the alveoli, or air sacs, to fill up with fluid or pus. [...]  If pneumonia does not resolve it can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and decreased pulmonary function.
  
  There are several viral infections that lead to pneumonia (16). Influenza A virus (IAV) primarily infects the lung epithelium, and can cause viral pneumonia. [...] There are also a variety of other viruses that can infect the lower respiratory tract and lead to pneumonia, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, human metapneumonia, and some adenoviruses (14, 18–22). Rhinoviruses and newly described coronaviruses also infect the respiratory tract and cause disease. [...]
  
  A variety of bacteria can also lead to the development of pneumonia. Bacterial pathogens as well as opportunistic infections (also known as pathobionts) can lead to pneumonia when allowed to infect the lower respiratory region. Bacteria that cause LRTIs naturally colonize the nasopharynx, but can cause disease when allowed to proliferate in the lower respiratory region (24–28). The most common examples of these are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Other bacteria are acquired from the environment, and often these bacteria have specific virulence factors that allow for the adaptation and infection of the lower respiratory tract (29). [...]
  
  The vast majority of research in infection biology has been devoted to studying the interactions of a single pathogen with a host. In addition to single infections causing pneumonia, a common complication following infection with respiratory viruses is bacterial pneumonia (9, 26, 39–56).Many clinical infections and presumably subclinical infections are often in fact coinfections, in that two (or more) pathogens simultaneously or in close temporal proximity infect a single host (9, 26, 39–59). These infections are termed secondary infection, superinfection, or coinfection. The simultaneous response of two pathogens can manifest in many ways and often results in increased morbidity and mortality. 
  
  To determine the best treatment options for patients with complex viral/bacterial coinfections increased understanding of the interplay between pathogens and the interaction with the host is necessary. Several viruses and bacteria have been shown to interact to worsen clinical outcomes. It is now believed that most of the deaths associated with the 1918 influenza pandemic were caused by superinfection with bacteria (60, 61). IAV/S. pneumoniae coinfection is perhaps the most well-studied example of viral/bacterial coinfection of the lung (62). However, bacterial coinfection also complicates infection with other respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus, metapneumonovirus, RSV, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and coronavirus (52, 63–66). Young children are especially vulnerable to bacterial complications following viral infection (44, 62, 67, 68).


So the NICE (i.e. UK) guidelines for diagnosing pneumonia say for example:


  Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a lower respiratory tract infection most commonly caused by bacteria; however, viruses are thought to cause approximately 13% of cases in adults, and approximately 66% of cases in children and young people. The main bacterial pathogen causing CAP is Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by Haemophilus influenzae; epidemics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae occur approximately every 4 years in the UK, and mainly affect children.
  
  Inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for respiratory tract infections is common in general practice. [...]


So if you are an adult suffering from pneumonia (the Covid-19 pandemic aside) chances are you more likely you have bacterial pneumonia.


  NG120 also emphasises the importance of face-to-face clinical examination in patients with acute cough if prescription of an antibiotic is being considered. Clinicians should therefore avoid issuing antibiotics for cough without a face-to-face examination. If bacterial pneumonia is suspected, it is important to assess the clinical signs and to determine their severity. [...]
  
  An antibiotic should be offered within 4 hours of establishing a diagnosis of pneumonia, and a 5-day course is considered appropriate in all severity gradings.


Also worth quoting from those guidelines:


  In practice, patients often return at the end of the antibiotic course due to concerns that symptoms have not resolved; however, in pneumonia, we should not expect symptom resolution at this stage. When issuing an antibiotic, it is important to explain to patients that their symptoms are highly unlikely to have resolved at the end of the course, but that the infection will have been adequately treated. It may be helpful to bear in mind that chest X-rays are not expected to return to normal for up to 6 weeks after pneumonia, reflecting the ongoing inflammatory rather than infective process.
  
  Sputum samples do not need to be routinely sent for patients with CAP treated in primary care. However, they can be useful if signs or symptoms have not improved as expected after antibiotic treatment, or in people who have previously had frequent courses of antibiotics, as this increases the likelihood of resistant organisms.


Basically, unless the pneumonia is severe enough (to require hospitalization), you won't get a test to determine the agent that caused it, unless the first course antibiotic doesn't resolve it.

I can tell you from general experience that the cause of pneumonia will get tested in severe cases in a hospital setting in almost any country. (There are probably some WHO guidelines for this, but I can't be bothered to search them now.)

Short coda on Covid-19:


  A study of 191 patients in two Wuhan hospitals showed that 50 percent of those who died tested positive for secondary infections compared to only one of the 137 survivors. In this situation, antibiotics form a crucial second line of defence. Many studies indicate that nearly all severe COVID-19 patients will receive antibiotics. 

","Dentures:

In general, there are two kinds of removable denture: Complete and Partial, indicating whether the denture replaces all or only some of the teeth. 

Purposes:


Restore or improve masticatory function (eating)
Restore or improve phonetics (speech)
Restore or improve esthetics (smile and appearance)


Keep in mind that the patient will need time to adjust to the dentures and that most dentures don't behave like the original teeth.

Design:

Their physical design which will determine the following:


stability (whether it uses extensions, clasps around teeth or attaches itself to implants to prevent it from moving side to side)
retention (whether it uses suction, clasps around remaining teeth or attaches itself to implants to prevent it from getting out of place vertically)
support (whether it rests on the gums, has rests to support itself on teeth or attaches itself to implants to resists vertical chewing forces)


Procedure:

The number of appointments depends on the work that needs to be done before making the denture. For example, The dentist will have to plan out the treatment, do filling, extractions or other surgeries (ex: place implants). As for the dentures,  it takes at the very least a few separate appointments depending on the treatment plan to get the right shape of the denture as well as the position of the teeth.

Practically speaking, the share price for an active company never reaches 0. There are always people willing to buy at a low enough price. Furthermore, the price reported for a stock is the last price at which the stock was sold. If demand for the stock were to fall to 0, there would simply be no liquidity (no shares of the stock bought or sold), but the share price would still be reported at whatever the last transaction price was.

1,biomedical,biology.stackexchange.com,"It's my understanding that the majority of symptoms associated with the common cold (runny nose, inflamed sinus, slight fever) are essentially the result of the immune system's response.

I've never heard of someone dying of the common cold (unlike influenza), even in immune compromised people. As such, what damage would the cold virus inflict if there was no immune response? Would it be catastrophic?
","Can someone die of the common cold?

No. 
The common cold is a clinical syndrome restricted to upper respiratory tract involvement. By clinical syndrome, I mean it is the constellation of symptoms (rather than the consequence of a specific pathogen). As you mention, these symptoms are the result of the immune response, rather than tissue damage or compromised function as a direct effect of a pathogen or its toxin (e.g., the watery diarrhea in cholera).  

As defined (see, e.g., Cecil Medicine Ch. 369), this clinical syndrome cannot lead to death. 


  The common cold is an upper respiratory syndrome of rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction, frequently accompanied by sore throat, sneezing, and cough.


Can the viruses that cause the common cold cause death?

Yes. Many viruses that cause the common cold also cause other clinical syndromes that can cause death. This occurs when viral replication moves to the lower respiratory tract. As an example, influenza viruses are responsible for 25 - 30% of common colds (see Bennett, Principles and Practice of Infectious Disease, Ch.58). When it moves beyond the upper respiratory tract, influenza is responsible for substantial mortality. Other virus families that are responsible for both a common cold syndrome and lower respiratory tract syndrome in immunocompetent individuals (e.g., bronchiolitis, pneumonia) include parainfluenza virus, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and (rarely) coronavirus. Rhinovirus, responsible for 40-50% of common cold cases, is uniquely unsuited to lower respiratory tract involvement, because of its preference for the cooler environment of the nasal mucosa, replicating best at 33 C (Murray Medical Microbiology, Ch 56). However, in individuals with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), lower respiratory tract involvement does occur. There are a number of case series reporting death due to lower respiratory rhinovirus. This is an example.

Can the common cold lead to serious illnesses other than lower respiratory tract involvement?

Yes. Other morbidity can occur as a result of the immune response that produces the common cold syndrome. Rhinorrhea and congestion can progress to a viral rhinosinusitis, a separate syndrome with its own complications, or a secondary bacterial infection, which can lead to bacterial sinus involvement and/or bacterial lower respiratory tract infection. Otitis media is another common complication, especially in children, and has its own potential complications. Asthma (and, generally speaking, most lung diseases) can also be exacerbated by what would otherwise be a simple common cold and predisposes to lower respiratory tract involvement. Asthma does deserve special mention, because rhinovirus associated exacerbations can be fatal, but this is a consequence of asthma rather than a common cold syndrome. Further discussion of these syndromes are beyond the scope of the question, but are discussed briefly in the chapters referenced above.

And even if you’re under a stay-at-home order, donating blood is an essential need, so public health officials have made an exception for your trip to the donation center.  To find a donation center, check the American Association of Blood Banks [locator](http://www.aabb.org/tm/donation/Pages/Blood-Bank-Locator.aspx), visit the Red Cross [website](https://www.redcrossblood.org/) or call 1-800-RED-CROSS."," relief international  http://www.ri.org/donate/ , which operates in 16 countries throughout africa, the middle east and asia, has focused some of its efforts on helping iran, where more than 20,000 infections and at least 1,500 deaths have been reported.  heart to heart international  http://www.hearttoheart.org/covid-19-update/  is distributing urgently needed equipment and medication to its partners around the world. medical supplies are also being delivered to providers on the front lines.",66

A friend gets my paper and shopping, and I have meals delivered - how do I unpack?","Covid-19 is primarily spread in tiny droplets released from the nose and mouth of an infected person as they cough. The most common way for the virus to be transmitted appears to be through close contact with an infected person.

However, evidence suggests the virus can live for an extended time outside of the body, including on surfaces. If you touch a contaminated surface and then your nose or mouth, there's a possibility you could become infected.

A study published last month suggests the virus survives longest on plastic and stainless steel surfaces - up to two to three days - and can live for up to 24 hours on cardboard. However, over that time the virus is likely to become less powerful.

Where possible, it is a good idea to either disinfect the packaging with kitchen spray or discard it before washing your hands with soap and water.

For items like a newspaper that can't be washed, the likelihood of transmission is low, but it still makes sense to practise regular hand washing.

Bearing in mind the virus's durability, it's also worth regularly disinfecting plastic and stainless steel surfaces such as door handles.","Covid-19 is primarily spread in tiny droplets released from the nose and mouth of an infected person as they cough.
