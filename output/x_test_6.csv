" There is a lot of misinformation out there about the coronavirus. Some of it is based on misinformation and misinformation from the mainstream media.  For example, the Washington Post has a page dedicated to debunking this misinformation, but it doesn't mention any specific facts about this virus, other than the fact that it's been around for a long time and can be transmitted from person to person (i.e. people can catch it from someone who has it).  So, I'm asking this question because I think it would be very helpful to have some context for what's actually going on in this country right now, and what the current situation is like in other countries, so that we can make informed decisions about how to respond to this pandemic and how we're going to deal with it in a way that protects our health and the lives of those we care about most, including our elderly and those who are most at risk of serious illness or death. I'd like to know what specific information we should be providing to our healthcare providers regarding this, in particular regarding the use of masks and gowns, as a means of protecting ourselves and our loved ones from potentially infected people, especially those with underlying health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, lung disease or other chronic conditions. What specific guidelines should we be using to ensure that people are properly dressed, how long they can stay in their gown and gloves, what kind of hand hygiene products they should use, etc.?  I know that there are a number of different government and non-governmental organizations that are working on these kinds of issues, e.g. the World Health Organization, WHO, World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), WHO Global Programme on Coronaviruses and Disease (GOPO), the International Committee on Disease Prevention and Control (ICDC), and many more. But I don't think there's a single organization that has the expertise or the capacity to objectively assess and objectively evaluate the risks and benefits of wearing and using masks, whether they are effective in preventing or treating COVID-2019, or whether their use is associated with better outcomes for people living with HIV and other HIV-affected people in developing countries or countries where the disease is most likely to be most severe. In particular, there have been no systematic reviews or meta-analyses on the effectiveness of any of these approaches, nor have there been peer-reviewed articles or clinical trials assessing the safety and efficacy of such interventions in countries with or without a confirmed case fatality rate of HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, HIV, pneumonias, adenovirus, pneumonia, acute myelitis, chronic respiratory disease (COSE), malaria-associated respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV-2) or malaria–associated viral pneumonia (PAM) as potential prevention or treatment strategies. WHO has not published a systematic review of its own (or its collaborators') effectiveness or effectiveness in any country in its field of public health management, for example malaria prevention, treatment or prevention of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, despite extensive international and domestic research on its effectiveness and effectiveness (see here for an overview of WHO's efforts to date). WHO does not currently recommend any form of face coverings in public settings, except for medical care workers and healthcare workers in health care facilities where they may be required to wear a mask or gown in order to prevent the spread of communicable disease. For more information on how WHO evaluates and evaluates interventions, see WHO’s Managing Illness and Health in Developing Countries and its Coordinated Efforts to Reduce Illnesses and Residencies and Coordinated Public Health Organizations (WHO and World Health Organisation) on how they operate, how they conduct research and develop and disseminate information and recommendations for countries to take action to reduce ill-health and prevent or manage ill health.  WHO is working with partners and stakeholders to identify, develop, implement, test and evaluate technologies and services that can best meet the needs of developing and deployment countries and to support the delivery of information, services and technologies necessary to meet their obligations under the Common Declaration of Human Rights (CPHR), including the right to freedom of expression, due process and access to information. Countries should take all necessary"
" I am a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Waterloo. My advisor is a professor of mechanical engineering. She is currently working on a project to develop a robot that can perform tasks such as cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. Her robot is based on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which was first identified in 2003. It has a high-level human-to-human transmission mechanism and is capable of reproducing itself in a variety of environments, including indoor and outdoor environments.  The robot has been engineered to be able to perform these tasks in environments that are conducive to its ability to thrive in, for example, a laboratory setting, where it can be used as a resource for research, as well as as in research settings where the human intervention is required to protect the health and well-being of its users.


I am interested in learning more about the biology of this virus and how it spreads. What are the challenges and challenges of designing and developing a vaccine for this new virus?  I would love to hear your thoughts on these issues. Please let me know if you have any ideas for future research projects that could potentially benefit the research community in this area. Thanks in advance!  
Edit: I have now received a reply from the advisor, who is very clear that she is not aware of any research project that would benefit from using a human as the primary source of vaccine candidate. I do not want to make a big deal of a fuss about this, I just wanted to clarify a few points. First of all, she does not know that there are currently any human clinical trials underway for the vaccine. Secondly, the current pandemic is being led by China, so it would be very difficult for her to predict exactly how the virus would spread, given that it is thought to originate from bats and not from humans. In addition, there is no evidence that bats or other animals have been infected, nor have they been exposed to it. Furthermore, bats are not the main reservoir reservoir of virus for which vaccines are developed. Therefore, any vaccine development would need to take into account the bats' unique ecology, their unique biology and the unique challenges they face in their daily lives. This is, of course, subject to many other factors, e.g. how well they are adapted to live in different environments and their immune responses to pathogens. However, this is an extremely challenging and challenging field and one that requires a lot of research. So, my question is: how can I best support my advisor in her efforts to understand this and to help her understand how this could be achieved? I hope that this will be of interest to you, in particular if it helps to answer your own questions about how to proceed with research on this particular virus. Also, if this answer is helpful for you in your field, please share it with me so that I may incorporate it into my own research efforts. If not, then please send me a message and I will try my best to reply as quickly as possible to any of your questions. Thank you very much! (Edit 2: My question has now been edited to include a link to a recent article in Nature that discusses this very topic. See the link for more details.)

" Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory illness (SARS-CoV-2). The virus that causes COVID-19 is named for the Latin word for ""corona"", which means ""to die"". The name of the virus is also a reference to the fact that it is a common disease to have multiple names for different viruses. For example, in the case of SARS, the first name is Corona, while the second is Rhinovirus.

Why is it called the ""Corona virus"" when there are so many other viruses? Is it because it has a different type of epithelium called a rhinolophore, or does it mean something else entirely? I don't know, but it sounds like a good name for a virus to refer to a specific part of your body that is affected by the disease.  


  In other words, it means something completely different from what you see on TV or in movies. It's not like it's a new phenomenon, like the flu or the Zika virus, which are known to cause different symptoms. Rather, this is what makes it so appealing to scientists and public health officials, who are trying to understand how this virus spreads and what it can do to you and to help prevent it from spreading to others. Scientists are also working on ways to protect themselves and their loved ones from COV infection, such as using masks and hand sanitizers, as well as vaccines and medicines that protect against it. WHO is working with health authorities around the world to develop vaccines, medicines and treatments that are safe and effective for all people living with HIV and other viral infections, including those who have recovered.

" Shopping for groceries is a great way to reduce your risk of catching COVID-19. However, there are many things you can do to help protect yourself and your family.

You can:
Regularly clean your hands and cover your coughs and sneezes with the bend of elbow or tissue when you are outside
Avoid touching your face or hands with unwashed hands
Wear a face mask if you have a fever, cough or difficulty breathing
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue and then wrap your arms around your throat or nose
Practice breathing techniques such as breathing in through your nose or mouth
Take a regular swab every 15 minutes or so to look for any signs of infection
If you feel unwell, seek medical attention and call in advance to arrange a time and place for yourself to be isolated and cared for, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). You can find more information on how to care for animals at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus/how-to-help-your-animal-health-and-stay-well-in-a-safe-place/advice-for-people-who-may-experience-pneumonia-if-you-have-symptoms-such-as-sore throat, nasal congestion, diarrhoea, or other respiratory symptoms. You should talk with your health care provider about any changes you may have to make to your routine, to avoid unnecessary contact with animals, and to ensure you stay at home as much as possible. If you develop symptoms, call your local health authority or local authorities and ask them to take you to hospital, where you will be tested and treated for symptoms and if possible, if necessary, for treatment. The World Health Organisation has advice for people living with HIV and anyone with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection on its official website.

" Yes, you can still get paid if you work for a company with a contract for the COVID-19 pandemic.

Corporate HR departments are generally not required to provide paid sick leave. However, there are some exceptions. For example, in the UK, the Prime Minister is able to work from home for up to 14 days after his or her illness is discovered, even if he or she is not employed by the company. This is particularly relevant for coronavirus cases, as it means that employees are not entitled to leave to care for their sick family members. In general, however, this does not apply to employees of government or non-government organisations, and is subject to the general leave provisions of the Public Interest Retention (Employment Protection) Regulations 2020.

" Scientists are still figuring out how long the virus can survive on surfaces and how it spreads.

The virus is thought to be most contagious when it is carried by respiratory droplets from a person who coughs or sneezes. It can also be transmitted through bodily fluids, such as mucus, which can be inhaled or swallowed by someone who is sick. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that people should avoid close contact with people who are sick with coronavirus, including close family members and close friends. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the WHO is assessing ongoing research on the risk of 2019-nCoV from people living with HIV and those who have recently recovered. He cautioned against travelling to areas with more than 10% of the world's population, where the disease is most prevalent. ""The risk is very low,"" he told reporters in a televised address on March 27.

  “It’s very difficult to predict the spread of this virus,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, a virologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, who has spent his career studying the biology and pathogenicity of infectious diseases. But he said it was important to keep an eye out for signs of illness, like fever, cough and shortness of breath, as well as changes in temperature, light and other body factors that could indicate a change in the body's immune response to a new infection. And to stay healthy, people need to take good care not to touch their eyes, nose or mouth, or to cover their mouth when they cough, sneeze or feel unwell, according to the CDC. ” 
“The best way to protect yourself and others from the new virus that is spreading is to wash your hands often and thoroughly with soap and water, and avoid touching your face, hands or face coverings, said Michael Kline, an infectious disease physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Provo, Utah. People should also maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from others, especially their children and their caregivers, to help them breathe in and wash their hands.

" No. Dogs are not carriers of the virus that causes COVID-19.

Dogs can transmit the disease to humans through droplets from their fur or shed by people who are close to or have close contact with a sick person. The disease can be transmitted by touching a surface or object that is covered in fur, and then touching your dog's mouth, nose or possibly your eyes, which is a sign that the dog is sick.  Dogs can also spread the illness to other animals, including ticks, fleas and ticks that are attracted to the fur of a human.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has a page on this. It's called ""Diagnostic Procedures for Veterinary Diseases and Related Diseases"".  It states that: 
  The diagnosis and treatment of suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection is based on clinical signs and laboratory findings, as well as clinical manifestations and clinical features. Clinical manifestations include fever, cough, shortness of breath, runny nose, difficulty breathing or difficulty with respiratory function, changes in temperature, body temperature and body aches and pains, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, fever and dry cough. All symptoms are mild and begin gradually but can progress to severe illness. Mild symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Severe symptoms may include coma, coma-like symptoms, unconsciousness or inability to move or speak, loss of appetite, dizziness, drowsiness and difficulty in breathing. Patients with comorbid respiratory illnesses are at increased risk of developing serious illness, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (AERS) and acute myeloid leukopenia (AML). These patients are most commonly children and adolescents younger than 5 years of age. Children aged 5–17 years are particularly at higher risk for severe disease and are more likely than adults to develop serious disease. Adults aged ≥18 years and persons of any age with underlying medical conditions who have not been previously diagnosed with the 2019 virus should be encouraged to self-isolate for 14 days after symptom resolution, consistent with established guidance from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). For children aged 0–19 years, children’s health care should continue to be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with supportive care provided by a provider of choice. Children under the age of 1 years should remain at home with their caregivers and maintain social distancing and regular use of hand hygiene and hand washing.Children and young adults living with HIV should regularly clean their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before touching their face, mouth or eyes. Follow the directions of local health authorities on how to safely dispose of personal protective equipment (PPE) in accordance with local local laws and regulations.

" Yes, you can.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a page on donating masks, which states:


  Masks are a valuable resource for health care workers who are most at risk for severe respiratory illness and for those who develop severe underlying medical conditions, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (a.k.a., PMS), acute disseminated respiratory disease (AID), or coronavirus infection (COVID-19).  The use of masks is recommended by the American College of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (ACID) and is supported by a number of national and local health departments.  However, there is no evidence that wearing a mask increases the risk of developing severe illness or for the spread of COVID 19. Therefore, CDC urges all Americans to wear appropriate respiratory protective equipment (RPE) when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, including masks if they are in close contact with someone who has been exposed to the virus. CDC is also encouraging people to wash their hands frequently with soap and water, and to cover their coughs and sneezes with a tissue or tissue covering when they cough or sneeze. For more information about how to safely and effectively use masks for healthcare workers, visit https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/publications/2019-ncov/prepare-for-hospital-use-of-masks.html. CDC recommends that people wear cloth face coverings (cloth or plastic) to protect themselves and their loved ones from the potentially harmful effects of respiratory droplets and other respiratory pathogens. If you are concerned about the health risks associated with wearing masks or if you have symptoms, seek medical care early and frequently, according to CDC’s Manage Flu and Associated Healthcare Disparities (MIAHDC). Masks should not be used as a means of contraception, family planning, or other family-based health services. Instead, use appropriate disposable disposable face masks that are at least 2.5 to 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter and are constructed of a polyethylene (PPE) that is flexible enough to allow the wearer to easily carry the mask around while wearing it. The mask should be kept in a closed, air-conditioned, dry place, away from direct sunlight and sunlight-dampened surfaces. To protect yourself and others from potential respiratory infections, avoid touching or touching your face, nose, mouth or eyes. Do not touch, hold or carry your mask over your nose or mouth, as this could expose you to viruses that may be on your hands or into your respiratory tract. Wear a disposable mask if: You have a fever, cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or difficulty with breathing;
You have difficulty maintaining a distance of more than 1 meter (3 feet) from a person who is coughing; or, if your cough is more severe than the severity of your illness, your symptoms are worse than your usual symptoms. You should wear a face mask when you go to and from work, school, errands or social gatherings, except in designated public spaces and at public health centers where proper ventilation is maintained. When you and your family members are ill, cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow, then bend your elbow back and forth, so that the airway is clearly visible to everyone else on the plane or in the public space. Follow the directions of local and state health authorities. WHO recommends that all countries take every precaution to ensure the safety and well-being of all people on board their international flights and on their return to their countries of destination. Countries that have not yet taken these measures should continue to take all necessary precautions to minimize the possibility of serious adverse health effects on passengers and crewmembers returning from countries where the pandemic is thought to be most likely to have spread. All countries should maintain regular and regular hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene during travel and in public settings. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects with appropriate household and environmental disinfection products (e.g., hand sanitizer, hand rub, cloth mask, mask liners, etc.). Regularly disinfect surfaces, objects and surfaces with the least amount of household bleach or ammonia per square meter of surface area of contact (pFAP) of any kind with any surface on which the surface is touching the FAP (filtration material). If possible, wash hands of people who have been ill with or have recently traveled to or from affected countries. Avoid touching personal items or items of personal or household significance (such as couches, tables, lamps, light switches, refrigerators, dishwashers, washing machines, food and drink containers) or surfaces of public or private use (including bathrooms, sinks, toilets, countertops, counters, door knobs, lamp posts, cabinet handles, electrical outlets, heating and cooling systems, garbage and food containers).
If you have"
" The best way to know if a grocery store is open for business is to call in advance. If you are not in the area, you should check to make sure your groceries are still available.

If you do not have a phone or internet connection, it is recommended that you stay at home and only go to the store for groceries. However, if you have access to a computer and are able to access the information you want to share with your family and friends, then it may be best to stay away from grocery shopping altogether. You can find more information on how to protect yourself from COVID-19 online at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/how-to-protect-yourself-from-COVID19.html.


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has guidance for people who live in, or have visited, areas with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, including:
People living with HIV who are at higher risk for severe illness, such as HIV and AIDS; People with underlying medical conditions; Children younger than 5 years of age; Older adults and those with comorbidities; and Adults and children of all ages. Learn more about how your health and safety can be improved by being physically active and follow CDC’s recommendations for healthy weight loss and regular physical activity. Learn about how to maintain at least 6 feet of distance between yourself and others during daylight and daylight savings time (such as the time between when you eat, drink, and use the bathroom).
Learn about ways to reduce or eliminate contact with people you know or care about. For example, wash your hands frequently, cover your coughs and sneezes with the use of a tissue or tissue bag and avoid touching your face, nose, mouth or eyes. Follow the directions of your local health department and local public health officials for any restrictions on travel, movement, exercise and public gatherings. Check to ensure everyone is safe to go into and out of the home, as well as any personal protective equipment (PPE) you may need to use (e.g., gloves, face shield, mask, gown). If possible, avoid sharing personal items like tampons, sanitary napkins, wipes and toothbrushes with anyone who is sick.  
Stay home if your child or teen attends school or is in school-age care. Talk to your teen about the risks of social distancing and how you can reduce the number of visits to schools, child care facilities and other public facilities. Keep up to date on local and state health information and guidance from state, local, territorial, tribal and territorial offices of CDC and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). CDC will continue to update this information as soon as it becomes available, so stay updated on the latest information. CDC is working to develop a safe and effective method of family reunification and visitation for children who have been separated or separated from their parents or legal guardians.

" There is a lot of misinformation out there about the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of it is based on misinformation and misinformation from the mainstream media, but there is no evidence to support the claim that the virus is caused by human-to-human transmission. The WHO has declared the disease a global public health emergency, and the WHO is chaired by Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of WHO’s Public Health Division.  


The WHO was established in 1948 to fight the spread of infectious diseases. Its primary mission is to protect life on earth and to provide advice and recommendations to the global community on infectious disease prevention and control. WHO operates independently of the federal government and does not have legislative or executive powers. It has the authority to impose sanctions on countries that fail to comply with its obligations under international law, including war, terrorism, or the Schengen Area. Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Organization of American States (OAS) is the primary international body that regulates international human rights and is responsible for the enforcement of international humanitarian law. In addition to its primary role in the protection of people and goods, it has also the capacity to advocate for and enforce national and international actions to prevent, detect and respond to outbreaks of disease, to mitigate risks to human health, provide medical care to people living with HIV/AIDS, as well as to develop and disseminate vaccines and therapeutics.

" This is a very broad question, and I think it covers a broad range of situations. For example, if you are a US citizen and want to travel to another country, you may be able to do so. However, it is important to note that you will not be allowed to enter the US for any reason other than to visit a doctor or other medical facility. You will be required to self-isolate for 14 days, unless you have a medical condition that prevents you from engaging in certain activities outside of the 14-day period. This restriction does not apply to visitors from China, Iran, the Schengen Area, or any other country that has declared a state of emergency, such as the one that declared the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on March 22, 2020.


For more general questions, see this answer from Johns Hopkins University:
https://www.jha.edu/news/health/2020/03/23/coronavirus-covid-19-medical-conditions-stay-at-home-for-visas-declared-state-of-emergency-guidelines.html#ixzz2hXnJhbVnQ
And this from the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California (ACLU):

  “The government’s refusal to provide medical care to people who are in imminent danger of death or serious illness” makes it impossible for Americans to continue to practice their constitutional rights under the First Amendment. The government has no constitutional authority to interfere with the exercise of fundamental rights, including the right to life, due process and the separation of church and state.  
“This is not about protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens. It is about controlling the flow of information and information to the highest level of government.‘
The only way to stop this is to enact laws and regulations that protect fundamental liberties, not to make it easier for people to access information. That is why I am asking you to contact your state attorney general and request that he or she designate a special prosecutor to investigate this matter. If you cannot reach him or her, please call your local law enforcement agency and tell them that your concerns are not limited to this specific situation, but include a list of things you would like to discuss with your federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, religious, ethnic, age, disability, economic or political affiliation, as well as any special circumstances that may prevent your return to your home country or your ability to care for a loved one. In addition, call the local sheriff or local public health authority and ask them to designate special resources to assist you in this regard, so that they may have the most up-to-date information on this particular situation and how to best respond to it. Finally, contact the relevant state and local officials and explain that the situation is evolving rapidly and that there is no legal basis for your continued presence in any of these jurisdictions. Please do not attempt to circumvent the law by traveling to a place that is in violation of federal or state laws or regulations, nor should you try to hide in plain sight in a crowded, dark place, lest you endanger the health and well-being of other people in your country of residence. Your government is clearly violating your rights by denying you access to essential public services and by imposing unnecessary restrictions on your freedom of movement and personal liberty that could have far-reaching consequences for the lives and health of millions of people around the world. To the best of your knowledge, no state or federal law prohibits the entry of foreigners or nonimmigrants, except in exceptional circumstances, for reasons of national security, to engage in activities that are incompatible with international law or the protection of human life and property. Therefore, your refusal of entry is tantamount to an illegal and unconstitutional refusal by your government to recognize your legitimate interest in maintaining international peace and order, even if that interest is legitimate and proportionate to protect the interests of foreign citizens and their property and to prevent the spread of disease and other threats to national and international security. As a result, this refusal is unlawful, unconstitutional and void, voidable by the constitution and law, punishable by imprisonment for not more than six months or, in extreme cases, a fine of up to ten thousand dollars ($12,500) or both, whichever is greater. Any such refusal, however, is void unless and until the government can demonstrate that it has the necessary and appropriate capacity to carry out the denial, arrest and/or prosecution of such non-frivolous refusal without a court order or a temporary stay of execution"
" WHO is recommending that all people aged over 60 be tested for COVID-19 if they have symptoms and are caring for someone who has been exposed to the virus.

The advice is based on the advice of the WHO Advisory Committee on Coronaviruses and Disease (ACDC), chaired by Professor Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Professor Emeritus of Infectious Diseases at the University of New South Wales. The ACDC has advised against routine contact with elderly people, including those with underlying medical conditions, as this could increase the risk of developing severe illness and death. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this is the case in some cases, and there are no known cases of coronavirus-related deaths in the community.

I am not aware of any WHO guidance on this, so I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with this. 
If so, how does it compare with the current advice from the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP)? I have a PhD in epidemiology and have been working on a project to test the effectiveness of this approach, but it seems to me that it is being criticised by some as being too simplistic and over-the-top, with too little information at all about the actual risks and how to best protect yourself and others from them. I am also concerned that the'simple' approach of asking people to self-quarantine is not giving them the information they need to make informed decisions about what is best for them and their loved ones, which could lead to unnecessary deaths and unnecessary harm to people who are already at higher risk for serious illness, or who may not be able to care for their children properly (i.e. those who have severe underlying health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, lung disease or cancer, etc.).   I would be interested in hearing from anyone with experience in this area, especially if it has anything to say about this particular issue, whether it applies to this kind of approach from a medical professional or not, in particular if the risks are so low that they would not consider it appropriate for a young person with serious underlying conditions to seek medical attention at this stage of their life (or, for that matter, if their health condition is so bad that their child is unable to take care of them properly, e.g. because they are in a state of 'high risk' for severe acute respiratory infection).  In any case, is there anything I can do to help my young child better manage their illness or prevent it from happening to them at any point in their lives, given that I already know that some young people are more vulnerable than others to severe chronic respiratory infections? I wonder if this sort of advice can be applied to other types of health problems too, eg. asthma, hypertension, chronic bronchitis, asthma/hypertension, type 2 diabetes etc., which are not as well-resourced as these other chronic diseases?
Thank you in advance for your time!

" I am a PhD student in epidemiology at the University of Waterloo. My advisor is a professor of virology. She is currently working on a novel coronavirus vaccine. The vaccine is being developed as a whole-of-a-system to fight the 2019-nCoV. Currently, the vaccine has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human clinical use. However, it has been shown to be safe and effective against a wide range of viruses, including influenza, MERS, SARS, Ebola, dengue, rhinoviruses, rabies, influenza-like viruses (like the common cold) and more recently for the treatment of severe acute respiratory infections (SARS).  I am looking forward to working with her to develop a vaccine candidate that can be used to prevent and treat Shingles, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Covid-19, as well as other respiratory diseases, such as the influenza virus (H1N1, Influenza A and related viruses) in an effort to reduce the risk of serious illness and morbidity to people living with or exposed to these diseases?

Thank you in advance for your comments and suggestions on how I can best support my advisor as I prepare to begin my PhD research in a couple of years. In particular, I would like to know if there are any specific guidelines or guidelines regarding the use of corticosteroids and other drugs in patients with suspected or confirmed 2019 and/or re-occurring 2019 2019 SVRs, especially those with comorbid respiratory conditions, in addition to the usual antiviral drugs and antivirals that are used in most other infectious diseases (e.g. influenza).

" The most common symptoms are fever, cough and shortness of breath. People can also catch COVID-19 from touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, such as a countertop, a lamp or a light switch.

However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has advised against touching or touching your face, as this could expose you to viruses that could be harmful to you and could lead to serious illness.

" What is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from the coronavirus? What are some tips for people who are worried about their loved one’s health and wellbeing and how can they best protect themselves and others from this potentially deadly virus?
For those who have been in close contact with the sick person, such as family members, friends, and colleagues, there are several important things you can do to reduce your risk of catching the virus. For example, avoid touching your face, nose, mouth or eyes, wash your hands frequently and maintain a distance of at least 1 metre (3 feet) from people you are close to. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of local health authorities and local authorities to ensure everyone in your household is safe to go out for walks, exercise and socialising. Avoid social gatherings, including gatherings of more than 10 people, as this could expose you to potentially infected people. Talk to your health care provider about the risks of social distancing, particularly if you develop symptoms.  For people living with HIV and people with underlying health conditions, regular physical distances are recommended to help them manage their symptoms and prevent them from re-infecting or spreading the disease. However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that people stay at home if they feel unwell and that they are concerned about how their health is being managed. WHO advice is to stay home as much as possible and to minimise any potential for personal or community harm to others. You can find more information on how to manage your personal health at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronaviruses/2019-ncov/community-health-disasters/how-to-help-people-stay-at-home.html.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans. However, there is a possibility that some animals may have been exposed to coronavirus. For example, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been shown to be transmitted through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also be passed from person to person through saliva, through the nose or into the respiratory tract. This is why it is important to wash hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water before and after handling a pet or animal.

Is there a vaccine or treatment that can prevent or cure the disease? There are currently no clinical trials to date to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of any treatment or vaccine. Further research is needed to understand the full range of potential treatments and how they may benefit humans and animals. Currently there are no vaccines or treatments that are safe and effective for humans or animals, although some vaccines and some animal vaccines are being developed.  Until more is known about the true extent of human-to-human transmission, it will be difficult to predict the long-term risks and benefits of such a treatment.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" What is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from COVID-19 and how can I protect myself and others from the virus that has infected more than 1 in 5 people in Wuhan, China, according to the World Health Organization (WHO)?  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it’s important to keep at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance from people who are coughing or sneezing. WHO recommends wearing a mask if you are in close contact with someone who has been seriously ill, and WHO has advised people to wear masks if they are breathing in or exhaling droplets from their nose or mouth. However, WHO advises people not to touch or touch their face with their hands or face coverings, as they could transmit the coronavirus to others.

" There are two ways to measure the accuracy of a test. One way is to look at the number of positive tests performed. This is done by dividing the positive by the negative. For example, if you wanted to know how many tests were performed, you could do this:


#&gt;   test_count = (1, num_positive_tests)

  for (int i=0, count=1)
{  tests.each(c(i,pos = init, times = day, func = SIR2, parms = Opt_par))

The first parameter is called the ""parameter"" since it is defined as the sum of all the possible values $n$ for the parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$, and
$t$. In the second parameter $z$, the derivative of $y$.
The first two parameters are called ""variance"" and ""weighting"".
In the third parameter, $p$, we can define the covariance matrix $R_0$, which is essentially a matrix with the following properties: it can be either positive or negative: positive means that the observed data is true (i.e. it has a positive correlation coefficient with respect to $r$), negative means it doesn't exist, and so on.
We can use the Kalman filter to filter out the data that is not in the predicted data. In this case, we want to find the mean and variance of $\pi$ (the mean) by sampling the logistic regression model $L(\pi)$. This model is very similar to the one described above, except that it does not take into account the fact that we are sampling from a very small sample, so we do not have enough data to make a reasonable estimate of its mean. We also need to consider the likelihood of sampling $P(\beta)$, since we have only a few samples and we cannot make any reasonable estimates about the probability of getting the same result from different samples. Finally, the estimation problem is solved by using the SIRD model, which has been described in more detail in this blog post.  In order to solve this problem we need a way to model the distribution of samples $S(\"
" Exercise is a good way to reduce stress and reduce the risk of developing a more severe illness, according to a new study.

Researchers found that people who regularly exercised were more likely to develop symptoms of the coronavirus, such as fatigue, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Those who exercised also had higher rates of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure, among other symptoms.


The study, which was published in the journal Pediatrics, looked at data from more than 100,000 people over a 14-month period. Researchers found the most common type of exercise was running or walking, but there were also some types of moderate-intensity physical activity, like running for 10 minutes or less a day or taking a long walk or bike ride every day. People also tended to be more physically active than non-athletes, who were less affected by the disease. Exercise also helped prevent the virus from spreading to others, the study found. The risk for developing COVID-19 was highest among those who had at least one child, though that number dropped to less than 1 per cent among people with no other health concerns. More information about how exercise affects your health and how to manage it is available on the WHO website.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" Physical activity is a great way to get out and get away from your daily routine, whether it's walking, running, or using the bathroom.  If you're not physically active, you should try to stay at least 6 feet from other people and avoid touching your face, nose or mouth.

Some people who are concerned about their health or how they're responding to COVID-19 may want to consider taking a walk or two a day, according to the American College of Sports Medicine, which advises Americans to regularly moderate to help reduce the risk of serious illness and injuries to themselves and others. Exercise is also good for your health, says Dr. William Schaffner, director of the Mayo Clinic’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. You can do a few minutes of moderate-intensity interval-long-distance running (30 to 60 minutes) or a 30-minute run (60 to 90 minutes).  But you can also do lots of sitting, such as standing or lying down, and do some sitting-up and lying-down activities (e.g., sitting up straight or sitting down).
If you do not regularly exercise, consider going to a structured activity program (such as a weight-lifting class, a strength and flexibility program, an activity that helps you get up and move around, for example), and taking short-term physical therapy classes.

" The coronavirus is a new virus that has not been seen before in humans. It is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets produced when a person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also enter the respiratory system through the nose and into the lungs. This is why it is important to regularly clean your hands and cover your cough with your bent elbow or tissue when you are coughing. If you have a fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call 999 immediately.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" If you are a US citizen or permanent resident, you can apply for a Temporary Protected Status (TPS) under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), which allows you to stay in the US for up to 90 days after your return from abroad. However, the proclamation does not provide any specific guidance on how long you may be considered a ""permanent resident"" under this provision.

For example, if you were recently diagnosed with COVID-19 and were claimed as a non-custodial parent, your status could be revoked or suspended, depending on the severity of your illness. For more information on this, see How can I file for Extension of Status after I’ve Been Visited by a Person Who Was Not US Citizens for Certain Immigrants?. 


  The proclamation also provides that a temporary stay of at least 180 days is not allowed under section 212(a)(9)(B)(ii)(II)(D) of the Act, which is generally interpreted to extend the period of stay granted under that section for certain nonimmigrants who were not US citizens at the time they filed their return, as long as they have not been physically present within the Schengen Area during the 14-day period preceding their entry into the United States, and are not otherwise subject to the denial of entry or re-entry order, or who has been adjudicated to pose a risk of being exposed to or having the potential to transmit the virus to another person. See also this guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB):   Sec. 212. Visitor status.—Paragraph (1)(A) shall not apply to any alien who, prior to filing Form I-94, was an alien for purposes of this proclamation, except as provided in subsection (e)(2)(C) or (f)(4). (2) SPECIAL RULE FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FOR CERTAIN EXECUTIVE OR IMPRISONED WORLDS.—The term “special rule” means any provision of law or regulation that authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue a proclamation to a foreign national or foreign corporation that is a direct or indirect declaration of war on another country or of a declared international terrorist organization (as such term is defined in section 505(c)(3)). (3) AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH PROHIBITION ON USE OF AUTHORIZED MILITARY PREDICATION.—No proclamation authorized by this subsection shall be construed to authorize the use of military force against an occupying power or to interfere with the performance of an authorized military mission carried out in accordance with international humanitarian law. (4) CIVIL IMMIGRATION PROBLEM.—In the case of any military action taken to suppress a natural disaster or other international disaster involving the state of emergency declared by the President or by an international body acting under international law to protect the life or health of another state or the health or safety of its people, such action shall constitute a ground invasion or invasion of national defense and shall have the force necessary to accomplish the purpose for which the action was taken. Nothing in this section shall prevent the entry of aliens who have been designated as ""enemy combatants"" or ""persons of interest"" in international armed conflict proceedings or in cases where the alien has engaged in activities that are directly or indirectly detrimental to national security, including, but not limited to, human-to-human transmission of communicable disease or a pandemic of international public health concern.

In the event that an application is denied, a determination of denial is final and conclusive and may not be reversed or modified at any time. Upon application of USCIS or any court of competent jurisdiction to suspend or revoke a permanent alien's status for reasons beyond the scope of his or her status, he or she shall, upon application, be presumed to have complied with all applicable law and regulations and any order of removal or abatement of alien status that would have imposed such suspension or denial on such alien. Such application shall cease to exist if, after application and after the expiration of all proceedings for and against such denial, all aliens granted permanent status by USC"
" What is the best way to protect yourself and others against COVID-19?


Stay home if you feel unwell. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Wash your hands often, cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and throw the tissue in the trash. Follow the directions of your local health authority. If possible, avoid public gatherings, such as pubs and cinemas, unless you are physically present with someone who is ill. Talk to your health care provider about how to best care for you and your loved ones. Don’t leave your home unless absolutely necessary, including going to the emergency room, emergency rooms or community health centres, to get medical care. Call in advance to report your symptoms and ask about the situation. Seek medical advice from a GP or other medical professional.If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical help from an emergency department doctor or a local GP referral centre.Call in early to make sure there are no more than two people in your household at a time when there is a high risk of infection.Regularly, stay home to minimise any potential for others to spread the illness to you. This includes socialising and exercise, as well as regular hand-washing and hand hygiene.Talk with your family and friends about your concerns and try to stay as close as possible to them, so they can make the most of the time you spend with them.You can reduce the number of contacts you make to each other online, by using FaceTime or using the contact tracing feature on the Apple Watch. You can also set alarms to slow the rate at which people move between homes.Enable social media monitoring by following the instructions on your smartphone or by swiping right from the home screen.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" The main way that coronaviruses spread is through respiratory droplets expelled by a person who is coughing or sneezing. The virus can also enter the respiratory tract through the airways, where it can enter your body through your nose and into your mouth. This is why the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people wear masks to protect themselves and others from the virus. However, there is no evidence to suggest that wearing a mask increases the risk of catching the disease.

" There is a lot of misinformation out there about how COVID-19 is spread.  The misinformation is that the virus can be passed from person to person through droplets produced when a person coughs or sneezes. This is not true. The virus is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids, including mucus, saliva, and/or vomit. In fact, the WHO has estimated that up to 80% of the world's infectious disease cases are caused by a single person (WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus).

The WHO does not recommend that you wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after touching a surface or object that has been touched by someone who is infected. However, if you have fever, cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance, according to WHO guidance on how to care for people who have been exposed to the disease. WHO recommends that people wear cloth face coverings and masks when they are in public places, such as public health centres, health care facilities, healthcare facilities where people with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection are being cared for, as well as emergency rooms and emergency departments staffed by health workers. These facilities should be disinfected regularly and regularly for the protection of everyone in the health system. For more information, see WHO’s Guidance for Public Health Care Professionals on How to Care for People Who Have Been Infected and How to Wash Your Hands with Washable Face Pads and N-95 Mask for Protection Against 2019 Novel Coronaviruses in Healthcare Facilities, World Health Organization recommends Regularly Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects with household disinfectant wipes and powdered hand sanitizer to reduce the risk of infection. For more detailed information on how to protect yourself and your loved one from the 2019 novel corona virus, click

" The CDC says it tests people who have symptoms of COVID-19, but it doesn't say how many people have recovered.

The new test, developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), is being tested on a large swathe of people in the U.S. and around the world. It's not yet known whether those people will be tested again, or whether they will develop symptoms or develop a fever or other symptoms. But it's been widely reported that some people recover from the virus without needing special treatment, and some have even been shown to be immune to the new coronavirus.


  “We don’t know for sure what type of test is going to work,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the N.I.H.C. Vaccine Research Center. ‘We do know that it is possible to have a positive test for the 2019-nCoV virus. And that is what we are looking at right now. We are trying to figure out how well they are responding to that test and how they respond to other tests that are on the market. That is the goal of this clinical trial, to see if there is a difference between those two types of tests and whether or not they show any difference at all in terms of immunity or immunity to this new virus or the other one. So, we will continue to look at that and see what the results are. There is no vaccine, no antiviral medicine to prevent or treat this disease, so we do not know what kind of response this test will have at this point in time. The goal is to make sure that we have the vaccine that will protect us and protect the lives of those who are most at risk of developing serious illness and death.  We have not developed a vaccine to protect against this virus yet. However, there are some things we can do to help protect ourselves and our loved ones. For example, if you have been in close contact with someone who has been seriously ill, such as a family member or close relative, you should be able to self-isolate and be physically and mentally healthy for as long as you can. You should also be regularly clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from anyone who is coughing or sneezing. If you are not physically healthy, seek medical attention and call in advance to report you to your local hospital, where you may be asked to stay in isolation or be placed in a medically induced coma for 14 days. This is particularly important for people with underlying medical conditions, including severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). People with comorbid respiratory diseases are at higher risk for severe illness than other people, particularly those with mild respiratory illnesses. WHO is assessing ongoing research to understand the full range of potential confounders that may explain why some patients with severe respiratory illness are more likely to develop severe symptoms than others.

" There is a lot of misinformation out there about how COVID-19 spreads, so I thought I'd share some of it here. 

The first thing you need to know about coronavirus is that it is not a new phenomenon. It has been around for a long time. The first known case of SARS-CoV-2 was reported in Wuhan, China in January 2019. This was the first time a human patient had been infected with the new virus. Since then, more than 100 cases have been confirmed in China, including at least one patient who died. In the U.S., about 100 people have died from the disease so far this year, according to CDC. Of those, about 80% are in the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure. About 20% to 30% of those who develop severe illness are hospitalized, with about 1 in every 5 hospitalized people needing hospital care. Most of these patients recover, but some develop serious illness and require intensive care care and other critical care measures, like ventilators, masks and gowns. Some patients die from complications related to respiratory infections like pneumonia or acute respiratory syncytialde (a type of respiratory infection caused by a virus that causes the common cold). Other complications include pneumonia, acute myelitis, rhinovirus and acute disseminated acute lymphocytic leukemia (AIDL). These are the most common causes of death in adults and children, accounting for about half of all hospitalizations. However, there are still many unknowns about the true extent to which the illness can spread. For example, how long does the infection last? What is the incubation period? How does it spread? And, most importantly, is there a vaccine? There are no known antivirals and no vaccine candidates yet. What can be done to prevent the spread of this new disease?  The current pandemic is being led by the Chinese government, which has shown little interest in developing effective vaccines. China has developed several vaccines but none that are effective enough to protect against the newly-emerging disease. Instead, it has focused on developing vaccines that mimic the immune responses of healthy people. These vaccines target specific types of viruses and are being tested on a large scale. Currently, only a small percentage of vaccine recipients are thought to be healthy. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the safety and efficacy of vaccines and will continue to share updated findings.

" Yes, you can get a check from your state or local government. 

If you live in a state with a COVID-19 outbreak, for example, and your home state has not yet declared a public health emergency, your check should be directed to the state agency that issued the emergency declaration, rather than your local county or state health department. State and local governments can also issue emergency declarations, but they typically do not have the authority to issue such a proclamation unless the declaration is specifically directed by the governor or attorney general.


  In general, if you have a medical condition that requires immediate medical care, such as severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS), you should not be denied timely access to care. However, there is no federal law that specifically authorizes the denial of access, so any denial must be accompanied by a written explanation of why it is in the public interest to do so. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has issued guidance on how to proceed under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Under the law, a denial is a ""declaring of emergency"" if it ""is necessary to prevent the timely administration of a health care measure that is inconsistent with this Act or the laws of the United States.""  The law also provides that ""[t]he Secretary of HHS may, at any time, suspend or revoke the eligibility of any individual to receive a payment from a federally qualified health plan or qualified retirement plan if the Secretary determines that the individual has substantially foreseeable medical or mental health problems that substantially interfere with the performance of his or her duties as a provider of care for the common law or national defense, including, without limitation, “improper use of telehealth services,” (emphasis added).  This does not apply to individuals who have been physically or mentally ill for more than 14 days, or who are otherwise unable to work due to illness or circumstances beyond their control. For more information on eligibility, see How to file a Federal Disaster Relief (decrease) or Disaster Assistance (relief) Extension of Status (federal disaster relief) application.
You can request a waiver of eligibility for certain types of payments by filing Form I-94, which is required by law to be filed within 60 days after the date the application was filed. You must submit the waiver within 90 days of receiving the payment, unless you file it within the 90-day period preceding your application, in which case it will be considered nonfrivolous and you will have to pay the full amount within that period. If you filed it before April 30, 2020, it was not timely filed because you did not file by that date. It is important to note, however, that you must file your refund application within 180 days from when you received your payment. This is because the IRS has a process in place to determine whether you are entitled to a refund. See IRS Guidance for Certain Nonrefundable Refunds and Disclosures  (available at https://www.irs.gov/documents/irs-filing-for-recover-of-cancel-if-you-file-ira-document-faq-with-us-or-your-state-and-the-country-during-coronavirus-2019-annual-report.pdf) for additional information about how you may be able to claim the refund if your claim is for an improper purpose (e.g., to avoid paying your mortgage, etc.).  If your request for reimbursement for a mortgage or other non-purchase agreement is based on a bona fide need for personal or family assistance (such as to support a dependent on the estate or to help pay your child care expenses), the government may have grounds to deny the request, as long as you meet the criteria for eligibility under section 212(a)(9)(B)(ii)(II)(C) of this title (42 U.S.C. 1395a–1395n-1(b)(I)).  For purposes of determining whether a taxpayer has been denied, an application for refund under this section is not considered a groundless denial if: (1) the taxpayer is unable or refuses to make a timely payment under subsection (a); or (2) a noncustodial parent (as such term is defined in section 401(g)(2)(A)(i)) has failed to timely file (within the 10-year period beginning with such application and ending with an extension of at least 30 days before the end of such period; or
(3) an alien who was unlawfully present at the time the alien departed (whether or not he or she was physically present during such time) was found not to pose a risk of being exposed to or having the potential to transmit the virus to another person. (4) A taxpayer who is denied a request under paragraph ("
" What is the difference between a coronavirus and a common cold? What are the differences between the two types of viruses? I'm trying to answer this question by using the latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).  The WHO website has a nice summary of the data, but it doesn't provide any information about the different types or how they compare.  
The data for the 2019-nCoV (common cold) is very similar, with a mean age of 41.5 years. However, it is not clear if this is due to differences in the type of virus, or if the disease is caused by a different virus than the one that causes the current outbreak in Wuhan, China, which has infected more than 100,000 people. The disease has killed more people in China than anywhere else on earth, including South Korea, Iran, Iraq, Italy, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, as well as in some countries in Africa and Asia (e.g. the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, Viet Nam, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Liechtenstein, Monaco and Singapore).
However, there are some important differences. For example, in South Africa, a case fatality rate of less than 0.1% was reported, while for China the rate was around 1% (see here for a more up-to-date snapshot of this data). In other countries, such as the USA, cases were reported as early as mid-April (early April), and deaths were not reported until late April (late April). The USA has reported more cases than any other country (including China), but deaths are reported at a much slower rate (about 1-2% per day). This is because the number of people who die in a single case is much smaller than that of those who are hospitalized (i.e., the mortality rate is about 1/1000th of 1%), and there is no way to know how many people have died from this disease in that time frame. Thus, we do not have a clear picture of how the epidemic has affected the US, nor does it appear to be slowing down in any way in this country, despite the fact that the death rate has increased in recent days (from about 2-3% a day in New York City to about 3-5% in Washington, DC, according to a recent CDC report, though this may be a bit of a fluke, given the recent spike in cases in other US cities, etc.).
So, is there any difference in mortality rates for 2019 and NCR 2019?  Or is it just a matter of time before we see a difference?

" I am a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I have been working on a novel coronavirus vaccine for the past few years, and it has been a long time since I had any real experience with a vaccine.  So, I was wondering if there was any way I could apply my knowledge of molecular biology to the problem of designing an effective vaccine in a timely manner, given the current state of uncertainty about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine (see here for a recent example).  What are the challenges I would face if I wanted to apply this knowledge to this problem?

In particular, what would be the most challenging challenges?  Specifically, how would I define the ""challenge"" (i.e. how can I accurately predict the likelihood that a given vaccine will be effective in preventing or treating the disease)?  I'm not sure that there are any published papers that address this question, but I do think that it is important to have some kind of mathematical model that can be used to model the uncertainty associated with predicting the outcome of an epidemic. For example, here are some papers on this topic: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.01.022  (with references to some of these papers) and here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065-3099(20)30159-X/fulltext
(with reference to another paper, this one from the same university, which has a more detailed discussion of this issue): 



  The challenge is that we don't know how to predict how long the pandemic will last. The prediction model we have is based on the prediction of how many new cases will emerge from a single case. That is, assuming that every new case is infected, we can expect the number of new infections to decline over time. However, that prediction is not linear, so we need to account for this by taking into account the exponential growth in cases. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, for which we had a very good model, it was estimated to be between 0.1 and 1.5 cases per year. Thus, over the course of our epidemic, our model predicts that over a period of time of about 10 to 20 years (depending on how well the epidemic is under control), we will see a dramatic decrease in infections. This is because the virus is able to adapt to new conditions, such as temperature, humidity, temperature and other factors that limit the ability of it to survive in an environment where it can't survive on its own. Therefore, if we were to take a step back and consider the long-term (say, as many years as possible) effects of climate change on human health, then we would see an exponential decline in infectious disease cases over this period, even though we do not know the exact mechanism by which this is happening. We would also see some dramatic increases in deaths due to respiratory diseases, including those caused by influenza and related viruses. These are all examples of exponential changes in disease risk, not a linear increase in health outcomes, because we are not aware of any linear or exponential change in mortality rates over such a short time period. (Note that these are just the examples, there is much more to come in this area, see for example this answer from Johns Hopkins University about this.)
So, to answer your question: I think the best way to deal with this uncertainty is to use mathematical models"
" The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and shortness of breath. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually but can last for days or up to several weeks. Some people develop severe respiratory symptoms, such as a runny nose or difficulty breathing. Other people do not develop any symptoms at all. However, some people become seriously ill and require hospitalisation.

If you develop fever and cough, seek medical attention and call 999. If you feel unwell, call in advance and tell your health care provider what you need to do to minimise the risk of developing any of these symptoms. You should not touch your face, cover your mouth or nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze, and maintain a distance of at least 1 metre (3 feet) from people who are ill. Follow the directions of your local health authority and local authorities for any restrictions on movement, movement of people and gatherings of more than 1,000 people.

" How can I protect myself against COVID-19?
There are a number of things you can do to protect yourself. First, avoid touching your face, especially if you are coughing or sneezing. Then, wash your hands often and thoroughly with soap and water. Follow the directions of your local health authority, including the instructions on how to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or tissue. For more information, see How to wash hands and how to disinfect hand sanitizer from contaminated surfaces. If you’re feeling particularly unwell, seek medical attention and call in advance.

" There are several reasons why banks are reluctant to invest in index funds. First of all, they don't want to be seen as being too big to fail. Secondly, because of the risk of failure, there is no guarantee that the funds will be able to meet their investment goals. Thirdly, it is difficult to predict the long-term value of a fund. If the fund goes bust, how can it be expected to return to its pre-recession levels? And, most importantly, what can be done to prevent it from doing what it was doing before the crisis happened?


I am not an expert in financial theory, so I'm not sure how to answer this question. I would like to know if there are any financial models that can account for this sort of thing, and what would be the best way to do so?  I have a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Waterloo, Canada and have been studying the effects of shocks on financial markets for a long time. In particular, I've been interested in how shocks affect the prices of stocks and bonds, since the S&amp;P 500 is a very dynamic and volatile stock market. So I was wondering whether there could be a model that could model this kind of situation in a way that would allow me to make informed decisions about the future direction of such a large index fund, especially given the current state of uncertainty about its future performance. This has been my main research area since I started my PhD in Economics in 2005. Since then, my research interests have expanded to include the macroeconomic aspects of global economic events, including the spread of infectious diseases, global pandemics and the global financial crisis. My main interest is in understanding the ways in which shocks can affect stock prices, bonds and other financial assets, in particular in response to shocks to financial institutions and their shareholders.
Since my dissertation was funded by the Royal Canadian Institute of International Economics (RCIE), I wanted to apply this knowledge to understand how the financial system works, both in theory and in practice. As such, this has led to a number of papers on this topic. One of these papers is by Lawrence Lessig, a professor of economics at Imperial College London, UK. His paper is entitled ""Coronavirus and Stock Markets: A Model for Macroeconomic Dynamics"". In it, he argues that ""the fundamental assumptions underlying financial systems are fundamentally different from those used by governments and central banks"". He goes on to argue that this is because governments are ""more concerned with protecting their own interests than with the interests of shareholders"". This is an important point, given that governments have the power to impose economic restrictions on companies and individuals that they consider ""essential"" in order to protect their interests. It is also important to note that he does not advocate the use of quantitative models, which are often used to assess the economic impact of specific policies. Rather, his arguments are focused on how governments can reduce the amount of money they spend on social programs, such as social security and unemployment insurance, to help the poor and people in need, while also protecting the wealthy and corporations that make up the economy. He argues for using ""quantitative economics"" to model the impact on corporate profits and corporate spending, as opposed to ""simple economics"", which he defines as ""based on a purely qualitative analysis of corporate performance"".  



  In this paper, Lessigs and his co-author, Michael Osterholm, argue for the importance of using quantitative methods in assessing corporate returns, rather than simply using qualitative data. Instead of simply asking whether a company is doing well, for example by increasing its share price, or by reducing its stock price by an amount that is too much, these quantitative measures can tell us what companies are doing better than what they would have done if they had known the answer to that question earlier. [...]
In the abstract of their paper (which you can read in full here), they propose two different models: one based on data on shareholders' performance and a different one that asks whether shareholders are"
" The short answer is that the underlying economic effects of the coronavirus are very different than what you would expect from a global pandemic.  For example, the global recession has a much smaller impact on the U.S. economy than the 2008 global financial crisis, which was caused by a recession of about 1.5% per year.

The economic impact of an epidemic is different from the economic impacts of a natural disaster. For instance, if a wildfire in a country like China were to spread like wildfire across the country, would the government of that country be forced to take drastic action to contain the wildfire?  Or would it be subject to the same international sanctions that would be imposed on countries like Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and some other countries that are not in the region to deal with the outbreak? Or is it more like a political decision rather than a human-caused disaster that is decided by the people in those countries and not the local authorities?



 (Note: I am not asking about the political consequences of such a decision, but rather about how the decision was made. The question is about whether or not governments can legally punish countries for actions that they consider to be in violation of international law, i.e. ""violating international humanitarian law"".)  (See also the answer to that question here.)  The political fallout from such decisions is much harder to predict, since there are so many variables that can affect the outcome, e.g. political factors such as the number of people who are infected, how many deaths are caused, etc. (see here for a more in-depth look at this issue.)

" What is the current status of COVID-19 research in China and what can be done to prevent it from spreading to other countries?


China is currently the only country that has the capacity to rapidly scale up the number of tests needed to detect the new coronavirus. The country has also developed a vaccine for the disease, which is being tested in a clinical trial in Wuhan, China. However, the vaccine is not yet ready for human clinical trials, so it is unclear how effective it will be at preventing the virus from infecting other human populations. China is also developing an antiviral drug that can prevent or treat some types of acute respiratory infections, such as the common cold. Currently, only a small amount of research is underway to understand how the drug will work in humans and how it could be used therapeutically. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the safety and efficacy of using this drug in patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.

" This is a question that has been floating around the internet for quite some time now, so I thought I'd share it with you.  
The question is, how can I protect myself and my family from the virus that is spreading in our country?  I mean, I live in Germany. I am a citizen of the European Union. My wife lives in the UK. She has a British passport and I have a French passport. We are both citizens of Great Britain and we have been in contact for over a year now. The UK government has given us the green light to enter the country. However, we are not allowed to leave until the outbreak is over. So, what can we do to protect ourselves and our family? First of all, stay at home and avoid contact with anyone who might be spreading the disease. Secondly, avoid public gatherings and gatherings of more than one person. For example, if you are in a crowded park or a busy street, make sure you stay away from people who may be passing by. If you do not go to a public gathering, cover your mouth and sneeze into your elbow rather than your hand. And, of course, wash your hands before and after you leave the park, as recommended by the Prime Minister. Finally, keep up to date with the latest news and information about the situation in your country by following the official government’s official Twitter feed and following official news sources such as the BBC, the Guardian, The Times, Al Jazeera and other news outlets. You can also follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Facebook to stay updated on what's going on. As always, please bear with us and follow the advice of your local authorities and local health authorities as they have their own policies and procedures in place to deal with any spread of COVID-2019 and their response will be guided by WHO advice. In particular, WHO advise against travelling to places with a high risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (common cold and flu) or other coronaviruses, including Wuhan, Hubei Province, Yunnan Province and Zhejiang Province. WHO has also advised against all international flights to and from China, except for those that are essential for the safety and well-being of health workers working in affected areas. To learn more about WHO's advice on travel restrictions and how they may apply to you and your family, visit https://who.int/who-is/diseases-and-persons-on-outbreak-in-the-world/external-document/transport-restrictions-for-people-from-citizes-affected-countries/international-flights-to-chinese-city-guests-stay-home-until-symptoms-are-fallen-high.html. It is important to note that the WHO does not recommend that travellers from affected countries stay in hotels, restaurants, cinemas, sports venues, shopping centres, public transport or public health centres. Instead, you should seek medical advice from a qualified health professional and stay home as soon as your symptoms improve. This advice is intended to be general and should not be taken as a substitute for regular medical care or treatment. Please refer to WHO guidance for people living with HIV and those with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCov infection as well as guidance on how to safely and effectively use personal protective equipment (PPE) during the period of contact between an infected person and an appropriate health care provider. Further information can be found in WHO Guidance for Health Care Professionals on Personal Protection equipment and PPE (Personal Protection Equipment) in Public Health and Medical Facilities (PHMfPH). For more information and to find out how you can protect yourself and family during this time of uncertainty, see WHO guidance on personal protection equipment and PPE infectious disease and COVID‑19 (World Health Organization, 2020.01.20).

" There is no evidence to suggest that corticosteroids are effective in preventing or treating COVID-19. However, there is some evidence that ibuprofen (Advil, Zoloft) and naproxen (Ritalin) may be effective against the coronavirus. These medicines are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children under the age of 1 years. The F.D.A. advises against use of any of these medicines for children younger than 1 year of age, except for those who are immunocompromised and who have been given a supportive care package (such as a blood transfusion) or are taking antiretrovirals (like the flu) to prevent or treat the disease.

" The World Health Organization (WHO) has been criticised for its lack of action on the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

The WHO is chaired by former WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who chaired the organisation's first ever global meeting in 2003. He was also a key figure in the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, which claimed the lives of more than a million people.

 “We’ve been slow to act,” he told the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on March 20th, shortly after the US withdrew its military forces from Iraq.  He went on to advise the Trump administration on how to respond to the virus, and was later appointed US national security advisor by President Donald Trump. In the wake of the outbreak, however, he was forced to step down from his role as head of WHO in February, after it emerged that he had used his position to advocate for the use of chemical weapons against the Wuhan–led government of Hubei province, in what was described by WHO officials as a deliberate attempt to weaken the agency's ability to fight the disease. The WHO has since been accused of using its powers to suppress scientific research, with some of its most senior scientists resigning in protest at WHO's refusal to take seriously the threat posed by COVID‑19, despite the fact that they had a longstanding and longstanding policy of supporting research in areas such as malaria prevention, disease control and malaria research. WHO Director-General Kofi Annan has described the accusations of bias against him as 'ridiculous', and has called for an end to all scientific collaboration between the two bodies, arguing that scientific consensus is 'essential' for global health and the protection of people and nature. Mr. Trump has also threatened to impose sanctions on countries that fail to comply with his travel ban on people from the Schengen area, as well as travel bans and economic sanctions against individuals or entities that support or facilitate the spread of HIV/AIDS. On March 22nd, President Trump signed an executive order temporarily halting all international travel from six predominantly Muslim countries, including Iran, that was criticised by Human Rights Watch as violating the rights of all but a small minority of those affected by the ban. However, the order remains in effect, although the proclamation does not specify which countries it applies to. It does however state that all six affected countries will be subject to a 'permanent ban' if they 'engage in any human rights violations'.  The proclamation also states that any country that exercises its sovereign rights to freedom of assembly, press, assembly of thought, religion, belief or political opinion, or the right to self-isolate, is a state sponsor of terrorism and carries a prison sentence of up to life in prison without the possibility of parole, unless it'represents a grave threat to public health or safety'. In response, Iran suspended all flights to and from Iran for 90 days, effectively ending all travel to Iran. Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said in a televised address that the decision to suspend the flights was 'not based on facts, but on politics and politics alone'. He added that Iran would continue to uphold its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which he described as the 'last line of defence' against Tehran's nuclear program.

“The situation in Iran is very different from what is happening in other countries. We are very, very isolated, we have no access to any medicines, no medicines to treat the common cold, there is no health care system in place to deal with the acute respiratory disease that is causing so much suffering around the world. And we are not able to access basic necessities like food, medicine, basic services, healthcare and basic infrastructure like hospitals, schools, hospitals and healthcare facilities, to which the Iranian people have been extremely patient and have shown no sign of abating their need for such services. ”These are the people who are most at risk of being seriously ill and most of them are Iranian citizens, so they are at the very least at a very high risk for serious illness and for severe illness. They are also the most vulnerable in terms of economic, social and political disruption and they have the potential to be very destabilising and could seriously undermine the fragile economic and social fabric of Iran and its neighbors. This is why it is so important that we take extraordinary measures to ensure that these very vulnerable people are protected and that their health services are provided in accordance with international law and international humanitarian law. These measures"
" Welfare is the most important thing you can do to protect yourself and your family from the spread of COVID-19. If you are not able to leave your home due to the coronavirus, you should seek advice from a qualified health professional. You can find advice on how to stay safe online and in person at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronaviruses/social-distancing-and-stay-at-home-guidelines.html.

If you have been in contact with someone who has been infected with COV-2 and have symptoms, such as fever, cough or shortness of breath, there is a good chance you will be at risk of contracting the virus. However, it is important to be aware of the following things:


You have not yet been to a clinic where the disease is thought to have taken place
Your body is not functioning properly
There is no evidence to suggest that your health condition is worsening
The symptoms are mild and don't appear to worsen over time
Anyone with symptoms should be isolated and cared for in a health care facility, including a paediatrician, a GP or a specialist in the local area. People with underlying health conditions should not be placed in isolation, but people living with HIV and people with other chronic conditions are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes than those with mild or no symptoms. For more information, see WHO’s guidance on How long people can stay at home if they are ill. 
People who are immunocompromised should continue to practise good respiratory hygiene and avoid touching their face, nose or mouth. Follow the advice of your local health authority if you feel unwell and if you develop symptoms:
Talk to your healthcare provider about your symptoms and how they can be managed
Call in advance to arrange for a test or treatment, as soon as possible, to look for evidence of infection
Take your temperature regularly and regularly clean your hands with a tissue or tissue and cover your coughs and sneezes with the use of an alcohol-based hand rub or hand sanitiser
Try to maintain a distance of at least 1 metre (3 feet) from anyone who is visibly ill or has difficulty breathing. This is especially important for people who have recently been ill, or have a history of respiratory problems. To reduce your chances of being infected, avoid public gatherings or gatherings where people are mingling or sharing food and drink. Avoid close social gatherings and gatherings of more than 10 people. Talk to family members and friends about the situation, and ask them to share information about how the outbreak has affected them and their loved ones. Share food, drink and toilet paper with your loved one and take care not to touch your face or nose. These actions are intended to help protect the health and well-being of everyone in your household. WHO is working with partners to develop a range of actions to reduce the risks and provide the best possible outcome for everyone.

" I am a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Waterloo. My advisor is a professor of electrical engineering. He is also a frequent visitor to my lab, and he is very knowledgeable about the current state of the art in this area. I have a feeling that he will be very interested in hearing about my thesis, especially since he has been to a number of recent conferences and has a good grasp on the latest developments in electrochemistry and hydrodynamics, both of which are covered in my dissertation.


I am wondering if there is anything I can do to help him with this, or if he can help me with any other aspects of my research that I would like to contribute to his research project?

Thank you in advance!   (I would appreciate it if you could send me a link to any of your papers, if possible, in case I need to reply to your questions in a timely manner.)  If you have any suggestions or suggestions, please feel free to forward them to me, so I may be able to get a clearer understanding of what you are trying to accomplish in your field. Also, I want to make sure that you do not forget to include your contact information, e.g. e-mail address, phone number, etc. In particular, do you think that this will help your advisor in his or her efforts to develop a more complete picture of how COVID-2019 is affecting the field in general, i.e. what is happening to the fields that are most affected by the outbreak? 
 I hope that your question is helpful in any way you can, as I think it would be great to hear from anyone who has had a chance to speak with me about this or other related topics, particularly if they have had the opportunity to interact with my advisor on a regular basis (and if so, how can I best help them in their efforts?).

" No. The virus that causes COVID-19 can only be transmitted through contact with a person who has been infected with the virus for 14 days.

However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has advised against the use of face coverings in public settings, saying:


  “Coronaviruses can spread from person to person through droplets from the nose or mouth,” the WHO said in a report on the situation in Wuhan, China, on March 27.



 So if you are wearing a mask, you should wear a cloth face covering when you leave your home, wash your hands, and cover your coughs and sneezes with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, according to WHO guidance on hand hygiene and contact lens wear. 
 The WHO advises that people wear masks if they are visibly ill, or if their eyes, mouth or nose are badly damaged or they cough or sneeze. They should also wash their hands before and after touching a surface or object, such as a packaging or packaging container, before entering a hospital or receiving care, to reduce the risk of catching it from people who are ill or have signs of infection, including fever, cough and shortness of breath. If you have symptoms, call your health care provider and talk with your healthcare provider about how to best protect yourself and your family.

Stay home if you feel unwell. Talk to your healthcare provider about any concerns you may have about the health or safety of others around you. You can also take extra precautions, such as washing your hands frequently with soap and water or using the same hand rub as you normally use to wipe your cough and sneeze. And be sure to cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you are outside, as this could expose you to potentially infected people.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" What are the symptoms of COVID-19 and how can I protect myself and my loved ones from the new coronavirus?

The symptoms are similar to those of the flu, including fever, cough and shortness of breath. These symptoms can be mild or severe, depending on the type of illness. Some people can develop severe illness, such as severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), which is a severe respiratory infection caused by the common cold. Other people who are immune to the virus are more severely ill, and some people develop only mild symptoms. For more information about the different types of illnesses, see the CDC’s website, Coronaviruses and the Public Health Threats  and Information for Healthcare Professionals. Learn more about what is known as the “high fever”, which means the temperature in the upper airways is higher than normal. This is because the body's immune system attacks the central nervous system, the part of your body that attacks viruses. The body also attacks respiratory secretions called secretory secretes that are secreted when a virus sneezes or coughs. If you have high fever and cough, you may be able to breathe in droplets from your nose or mouth, but that is not always possible because of a lack of respiratory protection. In addition, if you are too young to be exposed to coronovirus, older people and people of any age with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of developing serious illness and death. Older people have higher rates of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and high blood pressure, as well as heart and lung disease and certain cancers, among other things. Children under the age of 5 are particularly at risk, with more than 80% of children under 5 living with HIV. Adults who have severe underlying health conditions (such as diabetes, heart, lung, kidney or kidney disease) and those who develop comorbidities like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are especially at increased risk for serious disease.

" If you are worried about the spread of COVID-19 in your community, you should consider following the guidance of your local health authority.

The guidance from the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Agency (HPA) states that:


  “It is important to ensure that people living with HIV and those with underlying medical conditions are treated with care that is appropriate for them.”  
“The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against the virus are to regularly clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 metre (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing, to avoid touching your face or clothes, and to stay home if you have a fever, cough or difficulty breathing or are in a state of high fever or shortness of breath.  These measures should be followed in all settings where people with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection are living together, including schools, healthcare facilities, public health workers and healthcare workers caring for children and adolescents aged less than six years, as well as community and religious services, child care facilities and places of worship. If hands and coverings are not readily available, people should practice social distancing and wash their hands frequently with soap and water before and after each visit to the health care facility. People should wear masks if they are outside their home, in public places and in areas with other people. Children under the age of 1 years should not be in any public or private settings, except for special occasions, such as religious or cultural events, sporting events or religious gatherings. For more information on how children can be physically and mentally healthy, see Children’s Health Guidance for Children and Adolescents and Physical and Mental Health (England and Wales).
You should also follow the advice of the local authority for the most up-to-date information about local restrictions on travel, movement and movement restrictions. You should check the relevant guidance regularly for any changes to local laws and regulations, particularly for those that affect your right to self-isolate, exercise, visit a medical facility or engage in other activities that are incompatible with your current or planned activities (e.g. religious, cultural, religious activities, sports, recreation, physical activity, recreational activities) and the extent to which you can continue to do these activities after they have been suspended or restricted. The guidance also provides advice on the ways in which people can safely leave their homes, work and social settings and how to maintain social distance and distance themselves from others. See How to Stay At Home If You Are Discarding Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) in Public: How Do Public Health Authorities Protect You? for guidance on when to leave your home and what measures to take to keep your health and safety in check.

" There is a lot of misinformation out there about COVID-19.  The misinformation is that the virus is spread by droplets from a person coughing or sneezing, but this is not true. The virus can be spread from person to person through droplet-borne illness. It is possible to be infected through contact with an infected person, and this can happen in a number of ways. First, the person who is infected has a fever, cough and difficulty breathing. This is why it is important to wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially if you are coughing. Secondly, people can become infected when they are exposed to an infectious agent. For example, if someone who has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 develops symptoms, they may be at higher risk of developing symptoms later on in life. These are just a few of the possible scenarios that could lead to a possible infection. However, there are many more unknowns and there is still much to learn about the pathogen and how it spreads. Therefore, I am asking you to share your thoughts on this misinformation and the ways in which it can affect you and your loved ones.

" This is a question that has been around for a while now, but I think it is really important to understand what is going on here.  The question is, how can we predict the spread of a new coronavirus?  For example, if we know that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has a very high mortality rate, we can predict how long the virus will remain infectious. However, this prediction is based on very small sample size, so we do not know what the long-term effects will be. For instance, in the case of influenza, the risk of transmission is very low, because the number of new cases is small. Therefore, even if the new virus does not spread very much, it will still be very hard to catch it from people who have not been exposed to it. So, what we need is an accurate model to predict what will happen in a short period of time (e.g. a few months).  In this context, I am asking this question because, as I understand it, a simple model is not very good at predicting long term effects, especially when the disease is so severe that it overwhelms the health care system. In the current situation, many countries are trying to implement simple models, such as in China, South Korea, Singapore, Iran, Italy, Japan, China. But, these models are very difficult to use because they assume very large sample sizes, which means that they are not accurate enough to give a good estimate of future trends. Moreover, they can not account for the fact that there are many variables that could change over time, like the temperature, humidity, disease severity, etc., which could make the prediction difficult. Hence, some models have been developed to help us to make predictions, for example the one I have just described, is called the ""SIR model"".  This model gives a more accurate prediction than many other models because it assumes a constant growth rate of about 0.5-0.7%, which is the rate at which new infections are detected. It is also very accurate at estimating the severity of diseases, since the more severe diseases are more likely to be fatal, whereas the less severe ones are less fatal. The SIRD model, however, gives an inaccurate prediction because of many unknowns, including the age, sex, previous contact with the sick person, duration of contact, type of illness and other factors. This makes it impossible to accurately predict future disease trends, i.e., how many people will develop new diseases over a given period, or how quickly they will spread them. Furthermore, SIR models only take into account the time between contact and the onset of disease. Thus, their predictions are much less accurate than those of traditional models. Also, when we use the same model for all the different diseases (for example for influenza), we get different results: for instance for pneumonia, influenza is much more deadly than influenza because we assume the incubation period is shorter, while for H1N1, pneumonia is more fatal and is less contagious. (See the answer on this topic: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20080217v1.full.pdf)  
So, to answer your question, yes, you can make a model that accurately predicts the future (but not the past) but you need to know a lot more about the underlying assumptions and how they apply to different scenarios. If you are interested in this, here are some resources:

" There is a lot of misinformation out there about the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of it is outright lies, like this one from the CDC.

The CDC is an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). It is chaired by Dr. Tom Frieden, who has been a top CDC official for more than 20 years. He is also a frequent critic of President Trump, calling him ""ridiculous"" for calling the president a ""pandemic"" during a press conference on Jan. 20.  The CDC has also been criticized for its lack of transparency, for failing to disclose the names of coronaviruses it tests on patients who have died. In particular, the agency has criticized the way it evaluates and reports on cases of suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV, despite the fact that the virus has not been identified yet in the United States. The agency also has a reputation for overreacting to public health threats, such as the 2003-2004 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, when it did not act quickly enough to contain the outbreak. As a result, it has faced criticism from both the left and right for not doing more to protect its own citizens and for acting more quickly when faced with a global crisis like the one faced by the Trump administration. For example, during the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump called for the deaths of millions of people who had been quarantined in countries like China and South Korea, but those countries had not implemented effective containment measures. Trump's response was to use executive orders, which he later rescinded, to suspend all international flights to the affected countries and impose travel bans on people from China, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. These actions were later criticized by many left-leaning groups, including the Center for Global Development and the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), which argued that these actions constituted a blatant violation of international law and called on the WHO to take immediate action to address the concerns of its members. On March 27, 2020, shortly before Trump took office, he signed an executive order that prohibited the entry of citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, as well as all non-Persian nationals, into the US. This order was later overturned by a federal judge in Washington, D.C., after the administration challenged the legality of this travel ban, arguing that it violated the First Amendment rights of First Amended Complaint Resolution (due process) and Fourth Amendment (unlawful presence). Trump later reversed this decision, saying that he intended to enforce the ban only on ""persons who are physically present within the Schengen Area"" and that ""it’s not constitutional to interfere with the lawful presence of a foreign national.""  In light of these and other recent events, there is no legal basis for a ban on travel from countries with ""high risk"" of serious human-to-human transmission (i.e. those that are ""highly traveled"").  


This is not a legal question, of course, since the President has the constitutional right to intervene in international affairs. But it does raise a few questions. First, does this ban also apply to nationals of countries that have declared a state of emergency? If so, what rights does that confer? 
Second, how does the executive branch's authority over foreign policy differ from that of Congress? Does it have a different interpretation of what constitutes ""emergency""?
Third, are there any precedents for executive actions that can be undone by Congress, even if Congress does not enact the action at the time it takes effect? What are the legal consequences for actions taken by executive branches of government that were not taken into account in this bill? I am not asking whether the bill would have been constitutional if it were passed without a presidential signature. It would be very difficult to imagine a bill that was not signed into law without the signing of an Executive Order, given the absence of such a signing, without some sort of legal precedent.

I am asking this question because I think it raises a number of important questions, both legal and political. I would like to know what the law is on this and how it differs from what Congress has done in past emergencies, especially in emergencies like World War II or the Korean War, where Congress acted unilaterally and without consultation from President Bush or Vice President Cheney (or, more generally, from a president who was in charge of national defense).  I also think the question is relevant because the current situation is unprecedented in American history,"
" The main way the virus spreads is through respiratory droplets, which are expelled when a person coughs or sneezes. The virus then circulates through the air and into the body, where it attaches to the nerves, causing pain, fever, and shortness of breath. These symptoms are called respiratory syncytialde (inflammation) and are thought to be caused by a number of viruses, including influenza, coronavirus, chikungunya, rabies, rubella, adenoviruses, Epstein–Barr virus, MERS-CoV and SARS. However, there is no known evidence to support the presence of COVID-19 in the human body. Therefore, it is not possible to know whether the symptoms described in this article are due to a viral infection or to an underlying medical condition, such as a respiratory infection. Instead, we need to look at the mechanisms by which the viral invasion is carried out and how these mechanisms are modulated.  In this context, the present study was designed to examine the effects of fever on the pathogenesis and severity of severe acute respiratory infections in a cohort of healthy middle-aged men. Subjects were recruited from a large tertiary care hospital in Wuhan, China, with a mean age of 61.5 years (range: 19–44 years). All patients were randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of 0.1 or 10 mg of corticosteroids daily for 14 days, or a combination of 1 or 2 doses of ibuprofen/progesterone every 3 days. Data were collected over a 14-day period, during which time the subjects completed a battery of self-monitoring and symptom severity assessments. Results showed that fever was significantly (predictor-modulated) more frequently in those who received the flu vaccine compared to those not vaccinated, but this effect was not significant. Further, these data suggest that patients with chronic respiratory illness are more likely to develop severe respiratory illnesses, despite the fact that they are not immunocompromised. This finding is in line with previous findings that influenza is more contagious than rhinovirus (19), suggesting that this is a potential mechanism underlying the current pandemic. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that a high-fat diet and low-sodium homeostatic diet can significantly reduce the severity and duration of acute viral pneumonia and that these effects may be mediated by immune-mediated mechanisms, rather than by the usual antiviral mechanism of action (e.g., innate immunity). These findings highlight the importance of maintaining a healthy weight and maintain adequate oxygen saturation in healthy individuals, as well as the need for routine physical activity and regular rest.

  Medical supplies are essential to the health and well-being of all people living with HIV, including those with COVID-19. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways in which people can safely use medical equipment, and will continue to share updated findings. For more information, visit https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/how-to-use-medical-supply.html.


The World Health Organization (WHO) has a list of essential health services that can be used by HIV patients and their families.  The WHO has also provided guidance on how to safely dispose of personal protective equipment (PPE), including masks, gowns, gloves, eye protection, masks with Velcro or polyethylene glycol (PEG), and masks that are not intended for use with medical purposes (e.g., face coverings).  WHO urges people to wear appropriate respiratory masks when they are in close contact with people with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, to avoid touching their eyes, nose, mouth, or mouth; to cover their coughs and sneezes with a tissue; and to wash their hands frequently with soap and water before and after they leave the house.

" There is a lot of misinformation out there, and it's easy to get caught up in it. 

For example, the CDC states that:


  “The most effective ways to protect yourself and your loved ones from the coronavirus are to regularly clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing, to avoid touching your face or mouth and to stay at home if you are sick.”
“If you’re concerned about your health and want to reduce your risk of catching the virus, you should talk with your doctor or other health care provider about any changes to your routine or how you can reduce or eliminate your contact with people you know or care about, including using hand sanitizer or hand rub or using the same bathroom or bathroom with a nonsterile partner or partner who is at higher risk for the disease, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).  If you have fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance to report you to a doctor, said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a pulmonologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who has treated more than 100 patients with severe acute respiratory disease and is now director of the nonprofit National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.
 But there is no evidence that hand hygiene is effective in preventing or treating the 2019-nCoV from spreading to others. The virus can spread from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when a person coughs or exhales, which can cause symptoms ranging from fever to shortness of breath. People can also catch it from touching objects or surfaces that are not their intended target, such as surfaces or objects that have a surface on them or are covered in a liquid or droplet. In some cases, people can become infected when they touch a contaminated surface or object, but that is not the main cause of infection in the U.S. and no one has been proven to be able to prove that touching an infected surface can lead to transmission of this virus. WHO does not recommend that people wash their hands after they have been sick with this or any other communicable disease. However, some people have reported feeling unwell after touching or inhaling contaminated surfaces and objects, especially if they are wearing face coverings or carrying a mask. For more information about how people are diagnosed and treated, visit https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronaviruses/2019-ncov/summary/symptoms-and-interventions-for-people-who-are-infected-with-COVID19/advice/about-hand-washing.html (accessed March 27, 2020).
The CDC has also published guidance for people living with HIV and those with suspected or confirmed HIV (e.g., here). The guidance emphasizes the importance of following the guidance of your healthcare provider to ensure that you and others are comfortable with touching, covering or exposing themselves to items or materials that may be on, or possibly in, HIV patients. These items and materials should be washed frequently and thoroughly with soap and water before and after use, so that they do not irritate the skin or mucus membranes around the hands or the eyes, nose, mouth or small-mouthed pharyngeal region (where HIV is thought to spread). People should wear eye protection when walking their dog or cat, avoid handshakes with their eyes closed or touching their nose without their proper protective eyeglasses, wear a cloth face covering when handling a handbag or carry-on when carrying an object or covering their mouth with one's own. Learn more about hand hygiene and how to safely dispose of household items when washing hands with appropriate household disinfectants and care products.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
