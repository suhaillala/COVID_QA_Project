" There’s no evidence to suggest that children with COVID-19 are more susceptible to severe illness than their non-custodial parents, according to a new study.

Researchers at the University of Minnesota found that the risk of developing serious illness among a single mother with two children and her two adult children living together was 2.6 times higher among those who had been separated than among the general population.


The study, which was published online March 27 in the journal Pediatrics, looked at data from more than 1,200 U.S. adults ages 18 to 44, who were randomly assigned to receive either the flu vaccine or a live attenuated strain of the coronavirus. The study participants were then asked to rate their health on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being ""extremely"" (extremely bad) and 10 ""not so bad,"" meaning that they had a ""high likelihood of having the virus,"" the researchers found. Those who received flu shots were more likely to have a high-grade fever, sore throat, and shortness of breath, compared to people who did not receive the vaccine. But the children of those vaccinated fared worse on tests that measured immune function, such as a blood test that showed levels of IgG, a type of antibody that is produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. And those children also had higher rates of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and lung disease, the study found, but those were not associated with any specific health problems.  
 “Children who are separated from their parents may be at higher risk for illness and poorer outcomes, including poorer mental health, poorer school performance and reduced access to care,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, an expert in family medicine and public health at Harvard Medical School. Children born to mothers who have experienced a miscarriage or miscarriage should be cared for in a manner that minimizes their exposure to viruses, he said. They should also wash their hands frequently, avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth, cover their cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from others when they are ill, to help prevent respiratory droplets from reaching their lungs and to prevent them from spreading to others. If the mother and child are living in separate homes, they should stay at home if they have respiratory problems and avoid contact with anyone who is not their mother or child. In addition, pregnant women and their newborns should regularly clean and disinfect surfaces and surfaces with household disinfectants and hand sanitizers, as recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

" There’s currently no evidence to suggest that using antiretrovirals (e.g. ibuprofen, naproxen, etc.) is associated with increased risk of serious illness or death. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has advised against the use of any form of antiviral medicine, including corticosteroids, as a means of preventing, treating, and preventing infection.  However, there are some indications that some types of medicines may be effective against some infections.

" I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Waterloo.

I have been working on a project to test the viability of a novel coronavirus vaccine for COVID-19. The vaccine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in humans and is being tested on animals. Currently, there is no human clinical trial underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. However, I would like to use this opportunity to ask a few questions:


What is the current state of research on human trials of human-virus vaccines? 
Is there a vaccine candidate that can be used to prevent or cure the disease, and how long will it be effective against the virus? What are the clinical trials that would determine whether or not this vaccine is safe and effective for human use? (For example, if the human trial is successful, would it have a significant benefit in preventing or treating the common cold?)
Are there any vaccine candidates that are currently under development that could be safely and effectively used for the treatment or prevention of diseases such as cancer, HIV, diabetes, or other chronic diseases? Are there vaccines or therapeutics that have the potential to treat or prevent some of these diseases, but which are not yet widely used in clinical settings (e.g. cancer vaccines)?
Can I safely use a human test kit to measure the effectiveness of an effective human vaccine against a disease? If so, what are some potential clinical advantages and disadvantages of using human tests for diagnosing and treating diseases in animals, including the risk of false positive results, false negatives, side effects, etc.?
If not, why not use animal testing for disease prevention, rather than human testing to identify and treat diseases that may be causing us to be ill?

" The current outbreak in Wuhan, China, is thought to be the result of human-to-animal transmission. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this is the case in humans. 

In the context of the current pandemic, it is important to distinguish between the two. The WHO has advised against the use of hand sanitizer in contact with animals, and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has banned the importation of raw meat and animal products from countries with confirmed or suspected links to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. In addition, the WHO recommends that all travellers to and from China be advised to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before entering the country, as this may increase the risk of catching the virus.

  The World Health Organization has also issued guidance on the handling and handling of imported and exported seafood, including seafood products imported from the Schengen Area, which are being tested for the novel coronavirus. These products must be thoroughly washed and disinfected before being shipped to or from a country where the imported seafood is suspected of having been introduced into the international food supply chain. This is particularly important in countries that have been hit hard by the outbreak, such as the Philippines, where more than 200,000 people have died in the first three months of this year alone. WHO is assessing ongoing research on how to best use all of these measures to protect the health and well-being of people living with HIV/AIDS and their families, while also ensuring that the protection of essential public health services is maintained and that international travel is conducted in a manner that is consistent with international law and does not compromise the rights and freedoms of health workers and other people.

" What is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from COVID-2019 and other viruses?

This is a rapidly evolving area, and there are many different approaches that are being considered. Some of these are:


Regularly clean your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after touching your face, nose or mouth;
Avoid touching objects or surfaces that may be in contact with you, such as tables, countertops, lamps, washing machines, light switches, etc.;
Wear disposable gloves when handling animals, including hand sanitizers and hand rubs.
Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or tissue soaked in warm, water or soap. If possible, cover your mouth and nose with an alcohol-based tissue before, during and after your visit to a doctor or other medical facility, to help protect you and others from the virus. (See CDC’s Tips for Wash Your Hands for more information on how to safely clean and disinfect surfaces and objects.)
Practice social distancing (e.g., using the same bathroom and changing facilities twice a day) and frequent handshakes with family members and friends, especially if they are ill or have other health conditions that limit their ability to interact with others. Avoid touching personal protective equipment (PPE) that is not on hand when you are away from home, as this can increase the risk of infection and could compromise your health and well-being (see How to Avoid Infections and Illnesses from Hands and PPE in the Public Health Chaplaincy of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Managing Illness and Well-Being from Personal Protection Equipment in Public and Community Settings: A Guide for Preparing for Health Care Professionals and Their Families at Home and at Work?, American Society of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, vol. 62, no. 2, p. 543-547, published online March 27, 2020).

" The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to be mainly transmitted through droplets expelled from a person coughing or sneezing.

However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said that it is not yet certain whether the coronavirus is spread through contact with bodily fluids or through contaminated food or drink.


So far, there is no evidence to suggest that people are more vulnerable to the disease if they have been exposed to it through food, drink or other means. However, WHO is advising people to wash their hands frequently and avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth, as well as their nose and mouth when they are ill or sick. This is particularly important for pregnant women and young children, who are at higher risk of developing severe illness if their body is damaged during pregnancy and childbirth, according to WHO. The risk is also higher for people of all ages, including those with underlying health conditions, and those who have recently lost their jobs, such as those at public health, fire, police and ambulance services. It is therefore important to regularly clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 metre (3 feet) from people you are close to. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority and local authorities for any restrictions on travel, movement or movement of people or goods. WHO advice on how to protect yourself and others is available on the WHO website and can be found on its official website.

" There is no evidence that the coronavirus can be transmitted from person to person via droplets expelled from the nose or mouth. However, there is a possibility that some people may have acquired the virus through exposure to infected surfaces. This is why it is important to wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after touching a surface. If you do not have any symptoms, use alcohol-based hand rub (see How to clean hands for more information).

" Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that includes the common cold, influenza, parainfluenza, rabies, and many more.  

The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the ""common cold"".  It is thought to cause about 80% of the world's colds, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  However, the virus can cause serious illness in people who are not exposed to it, including people with underlying medical conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, lung disease or other chronic conditions. The WHO estimates that between 1.5 and 2.6 million people worldwide are at risk of developing severe illness from the 2019-nCoV outbreak, which has killed more than 2,000 people in the U.S., China, India, Pakistan, Iran, Singapore, Japan, South Korea and the Philippines. WHO is assessing ongoing research to understand the full extent of human-to-human transmission, as well as the extent to which new infections are being identified and managed.

" What is the current status of the coronavirus in China and how can I protect myself against it and prevent the spread of it to my family and friends and family members? 


I am a Chinese citizen living in Hong Kong. My wife and I live in a major city in mainland China. We have two young children who are in elementary school and middle school.  
We have been in contact with a number of local health authorities, including the Ministry of Health, the People's Protection Committee and the Public Health Protection Office, all of which have advised us to stay indoors and away from other people, especially our elderly and people with underlying medical conditions, to reduce the risk of spreading the disease to our children and to avoid social distancing and other measures to protect ourselves and our loved ones from the potentially infectious disease. The government has also instructed health workers to regularly clean our homes and wash our hands with soap and water, as well as regularly disinfecting our cars and trucks with detergent and hand sanitizer when we are out in public. I am not aware of any restrictions on travel, movement or movement of people within China, nor have I been told that I can stay in hotels, restaurants, cinemas, shopping centres or other public places for the duration of my stay. However, I do not want my children to be in any danger, and have instructed them not to touch my face, nose or mouth with the use of alcohol-based hand rub or any other cleanser, lest they become ill or ill-preventing themselves from developing the illness. In addition, my wife is a citizen of China who has applied for a residence permit and is currently in her third year of secondary education, so she is not allowed to travel outside of her country of residence, except to visit her family or friends. She has not been to any major international sporting events, such as the Olympics, World Cups, Commonwealth Games, Diamond Jubilee, Olympics or Paralympic Games since her entry into China in January 2020. Her Chinese passport is valid until her application is approved by the relevant authorities and she has been issued a travel document, valid for at least 14 months, which she can return to China at any time, provided that she complies with all relevant local laws and regulations regarding her travel and her personal security and health. If she does not comply with these regulations, she will be subject to a fine of up to HK$600 (HK$1,200) for each violation of this regulation, or both, whichever is greater. This fine is in addition to the fine imposed on the person who intentionally causes the disruption of public order and public health by intentionally causing public disorder or endangerment of health or the health and safety of others by means of force majeure, fire, earthquake, tsunami, civil disturbance, disease or natural disaster. For more information on this matter, see How to Protect Yourself and Your Children from Coronaviruses and Protecting Yourself from Illness and Health from Illnesses in Public Area of China, World Health Organization Annual Report 2020-2020 (WHA), Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidance for Disaster Relief and Disaster Assistance (DIYDRDOJ), and Coordinated Disaster Preparedness Protection Strategy for Disaster Infectious Diseases (Diseases in which the life-threatening situation is expected to escalate into a state of emergency within a specified period of time within the next 14 days), the National Disaster Risk Assessment 2020 (NDPA) or DHS-CoV-2 Summary of Threats to the United States and its territories as of March 30, 2020, unless and until the Secretary of State submits to Congress a report detailing the situation in the affected country within that country within that 14 day period, within which such report shall be treated as public information and shall have the force of law effect as provided by section 505(a)(1)(B) of title 5, United  States Code, with respect to such country. Such guidance shall include the procedures for timely and accurate reporting of such information to Federal, State, local, tribal or territorial officials, health care providers, law enforcement and emergency response personnel, medical personnel of national or local government agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and their designees as appropriate, in consultation with their local and territorial partners and with appropriate international and domestic stakeholders. Any such guidance may be adapted and updated in accordance"
" The virus that causes COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China in 2003. Since then, it has spread widely throughout the world, with cases in China surpassing the number of cases reported in the United States in January.

However, the virus has not been able to completely eradicate the disease, and scientists are still trying to piece together how it spread. For example, in a recent study, scientists found that a virus can survive on surfaces for up to 14 days on copper, a material that is commonly used in hand sanitizers. However, that does not mean that it cannot also be transmitted through respiratory droplets produced when someone coughs or sneezes into a tissue, or through the skin of a person who has recently been infected. Instead, researchers believe that this type of transmission is likely to occur through contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, which is why it is important to regularly clean and disinfect surfaces around the body, including the mouth and nose, as well as the eyes, nose and mouth. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also issued guidance to health care workers on how to safely dispose of body fluids and personal protective equipment (PPE) when they are ill, sick or in need of medical attention.


  “It’s very difficult to predict how this virus will spread,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Coordination at the George Washington University School of Public Health. But, he cautioned against ""running around like a chicken with no legs.""  ""If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, you're probably going to get sick,"" he said. ""But if you get a cold and have no symptoms at all, chances are you'll be fine. If you develop symptoms, call your doctor and ask to have your temperature checked and your blood pressure checked. That way you don't have to go to the emergency room and get tested again."" The WHO recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before touching their face or hands, before eating or taking any medications or using the bathroom, to help protect themselves and others. And wash your hands frequently with alcohol-based hand rub, such as W.R.W. or Ethyl alcohol if soap is not readily available.  
 But there is still a lot that remains unknown about the true extent of human-to-human transmission. WHO is working to develop a vaccine and is encouraging people to share their findings with the public, so that they can make informed decisions about whether to travel to or stay at a health facility where they may have been exposed.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" The main way that coronavirus spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing or sneezing. This is why it is important to wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before touching your face, nose or mouth. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority and local authorities to ensure that you are not in contact with anyone who has been exposed to COVID-19 and is thought to be in the same category as others who have been diagnosed with the disease. WHO is advising people to stay at home and away from people they are close to, including their children and pregnant women, as they can be at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes.

" The best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19 is to regularly clean your hands, cover your cough with your bent elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority and local authorities, including local guidance on how to stay safe and stay home if you are in contact with someone who is sick or has been to a public health facility. Stay aware of the local restrictions on travel, movement and movement of people, as well as any restrictions that may apply to people coming from outside your country of residence. You should also be aware that you should not touch your face, nose, mouth or eyes, or carry any other personal items that could pose a risk to you or others.

" What is the current status of the WHO-CoV-2 ban in the UK and Ireland, as well as the restrictions imposed by the European Union on travel from the Schengen Area to other EU member states, including the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland?


The current situation is that the ban has been in place for 14 days in all EU Member States, except for the Republic of Ireland. It is therefore not yet possible to travel to, or visit, the affected countries without a visa. However, it is possible for a visitor to enter the EU from another Member State (e.g. France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Belgium, etc.), but this is not possible due to Article 25(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2004 of 28 March 2020. The ban does not apply to non-EU citizens who are citizens of a third country, i.e., citizens or permanent residents of another EU State. 
However, there is no restriction on the number of people who can enter or leave the country at any given time. For example, a person who is travelling from a country outside of its borders to a member state in order to visit a child care facility in another member State may be able to do so, but only if the facility is closed for reasons other than the visitor's personal safety or the need for medical care. This is because the purpose for which the travel is conducted is to provide a means of transit, not to prevent or hinder the entry or transit of individuals who pose a risk of serious harm to health and the safety of others. Therefore, for purposes of paragraph 1(a)(ii)(B), the prohibition on entry is limited to persons who have been ""visibly ill"" for at least 6 months and who ""are not otherwise physically present in a public health facility"".
For the reasons set out in paragraph 2(b)(i)(I), this restriction is inapplicable only to travellers who meet criteria of ""non-credible threat"". For this reason, no restrictions are imposed on nationals of EU countries who do not meet the criteria for this purpose, nor on visitors from countries that are not in compliance with this ban.

" There are a few things you can do to help your child stay calm and focused during the day, such as:


Practice social distancing (self-monitoring, socialising, etc)
Try to avoid social gatherings (e.g. pubs, cinemas, restaurants, bars etc.)
Use social media (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube) to communicate with family and friends
Take time to talk to people outside your home (children, teachers, co-workers, neighbours, friends, colleagues, schoolmates etc.).
Talk to your children about the news, movies, TV shows, music, games etc., and listen to what they are saying (listen to their favourite radio stations).
If possible, limit contact with people who are not in your household (parents, grandparents, grandparent, brother, sister, boyfriend, stepchildren...)
Set up a time of rest (no more than 20 minutes) between when you are away from others (30 minutes, up to 1 hour) and when they need to go to the doctor or other medical facility to get medical care (for example, if you have diarrhoea, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance).

" Yes, but only if you’ve been exposed to it. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, before touching any packaging or packaging materials, and after using it to cover your cough, sneeze or difficulty breathing. You can also use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to treat common colds and other respiratory illnesses, the CDC says.
 But there is no evidence that touching a plastic bag increases the risk of catching the coronavirus, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of California, Los Angeles. The virus can live on surfaces for days or even weeks on plastic and stainless steel, making it hard to pick it up from a trash can or discarded packaging. [See How to Wash Your Hands with Bleach](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/health/coronaviruse-how-to-wash-your-hand-with-bleach.html) and how to disinfect your hands after touching cardboard boxes, plastic containers and metal objects.


Soap, water and soap are all good ways to protect yourself from COVID-19. But what if someone touches your face, then spreads the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth? Or if a person sneezes on your clothes? And if soiled clothes are anything to go by, how do you know if they are safe to leave in the back of the vehicle?

" Yes, isolation is a good idea. But it’s not the only way to protect yourself from COVID-19.

Studies in China found that people with mild symptoms — such as fever, cough or shortness of breath — were more likely to be infected with the virus than those with severe symptoms, according to a March study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. And in a study of more than 100,000 people in Wuhan, China, about half of those who tested positive for the coronavirus were hospitalized, the study found.


So why do some people (like yourself) take antiviral medicine to help manage their symptoms? Well, some studies suggest that some types of medications — like ibuprofen, naproxen or hydroxychloroquine — may be effective in some patients, but they're not as effective as others in others, and they can cause side effects that can lead to serious illness. For example, people who are taking antiretrovirals (such as flu shot and corticosteroids) may not be as well-prepared for severe illness as other people, so they may take them at higher doses, which can increase the risk of serious complications, including heart disease, stroke, cancer and diabetes.  
 But there are some things you can do to reduce your chances of catching the disease from someone who is not taking any of these medications. First, wash your hands often with soap and water. Then, cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough, sneeze or feel unwell. Follow the directions of your local health authority, tell your doctor or pharmacist and talk to your health care provider about any changes you may have to make, especially if you have fever or other symptoms. If you develop fever and are concerned about how your symptoms are progressing, seek medical attention and call in advance, said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of neurology and immunology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and the author of a recent book on the topic, The Best of Emergencies: How to Protect Yourself From the 2019-nCoV. (Harvard Medical School Press, 2016).

" Antibiotics are a group of drugs that are used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections. The most commonly used antibiotics are penicillins, lopinavir, and metronidazole. 

However, there are some studies that suggest that some antibiotics may not work as well as they should. For example, one study found that ibuprofen caused pneumonia in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), but did not show any benefit for other types of antibiotics. Other studies have shown that corticosteroids may be ineffective against COVID-19, but these studies were limited to patients who had no underlying medical conditions and were not taking antiretrovirals (e.g., steroids). 


  In the current study, we show that, despite the lack of benefit of any of the antibiotics used for pneumonia prevention and treatment, the use of cortics was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of pneumonia among patients treated with either the flu or the pneumococcal conjunctivitis vaccine (PCV). These results are in line with previous studies on the effectiveness of different antibiotics in treating pneumonia. However, these results do not rule out the possibility of side effects, such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath. These findings are consistent with the results of a recent study that evaluated the efficacy of flu-vaccine combination drugs in preventing and treating SARS and MERS in children.
The study results also support the importance of using appropriate antiviral therapies to prevent and treat common infections, including those caused by influenza and related respiratory diseases. This is particularly important for those who are immunocompromised, as these patients are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from complications from the common cold and other respiratory conditions. 
In conclusion, while there is currently no evidence that any antibiotic is or can prevent or treat pneumonia infection, it is possible to use a combination of certain antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection and improve outcomes in a variety of settings. In particular, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of influenza, nor are they intended to replace or replace the health care system. Rather, they are an important means by which the public and health authorities can better protect themselves and their loved ones against the most serious threats to public health and the well-being of those living with or caring for them.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" There is no known risk of transmission of COVID-19 from pet food to humans. However, it is important to wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after handling a pet animal.

If you are concerned about your pet's health or wellbeing, you should seek medical attention immediately. If you have symptoms, call your local health authority and ask them to provide you with medical advice. You can also call in advance to report symptoms to the local authorities.

" What is the best way to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 in the 21st century?

The CDC has a list of things you can do to reduce your risk of catching the virus.  Some of these are as simple as washing your hands often and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth. You can also try to stay away from people who are coughing or sneezing, or people with underlying medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer or cancer of the lungs. But there are also important things to keep in mind:


Stay home if you feel unwell.
Avoid close contact with others, especially if they are ill or have a history of other health problems, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart or lung disease. If you develop fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Avoid social gatherings and gatherings with other people, including going to a park or hiking, and limit outdoor playdates and outdoor activities. Follow the directions of your local health authority (CDC) and local laws and regulations. Don’t leave your vehicle unless you are physically present with someone who is sick or needs to be isolated. Travel to and from work, school, religious, recreational or cultural events, as well as from places with high transmission rates (e.g., airports, railway stations, shopping centres, sports stadiums, ski resorts and other public facilities). 
Practice social distancing and regular hand hygiene when you travel. This includes handshakes, hand rubs and hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, before and after each trip, to help stop the spread of illness and protect others from possible infection. Do not touch your face or clothes. Why? Wearing face coverings can increase the chance that you may be infected and can make you susceptible to other viruses. For more information, see How much contact should you make with your health care provider? How much physical contact do you need to make to get the infection under control? What kinds of precautions should be taken to prevent the transmission? CDC recommends everybody wear a face mask when out in public, in groups or in designated areas. Regularly, carry a medical mask with you whenever you go out to exercise, go to the park, visit a doctor or other designated health facility, take a walk or cycle between work and play, avoid public transportation and use public transit. Use hand sanitizer and soap to wipe down any dirt or debris that may have accumulated on your mask before you leave the facility. And remember: Always use a mask to cover the mouth and nose, not the chin or elbow. When you cough, sneeze or feel ill, use an inhaler to relieve pressure on the mask, which can be inhaled or absorbed by the skin or mucus membranes. Always wash hands before, during or after any contact to people you know or care for. WHO has also published guidance on the use of face masks for people living with HIV and anyone with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in the WHO Guidancebook for Healthcare Professionals and World Health Organization (WHO) Managing HIV/AIDS: A Call to Action for All People Living With HIV (MOHOG): Use Face Mask to Protect Yourself and Others from the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (NCTV) Spread and Recovered by Public Health Service Workers (PHSEW) in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on March 27, 2020 (Public Health Agency of China).  This is a global public health emergency and requires all countries to take extraordinary measures to contain and contain the outbreak. The WHO recommends all countries begin to implement precautionary measures based on evidence and evidence-based practice, including public health awareness and assessment of the risk from COVID‑19 and the need for co-ordinated, rapid and sustained response. To learn more about WHO guidance on hand hygiene visibly clean your hands with a disinfectant that is safe and effective for you and your person(s). WHO is working with partners and stakeholders to develop a stronger, more effective and cost-effective approach to this critical pandemic. In addition, WHO will continue to work with health authorities around the world to ensure the protection of their populations, their health systems and their communities through coordinated and continuous ensure that all people have access to essential health services and that their health immunity is sufficient to meet the highest standards of quality and quantity.    WHO works with governments and non-governmental organizations to identify, develop, implement and disseminate best practices for all levels of government to support the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of all types of infectious diseases"
" The main difference between the two is that people who have been exposed to the virus in the past few days are more likely to develop symptoms of the disease.

For example, a person who has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 14 days in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, tested positive for the coronavirus. He had been in contact with a relative who had recently returned from a trip to China. The relative had visited the US recently, and the relative was visiting a family member who was also recently infected.  In the current outbreak, this relative is thought to be the first person in China to have developed symptoms, which is why it is important to monitor the health care workers who are treating the patients in their care.


  The risk factors for severe illness in people with mild illness are as follows:
Age, sex, education level, occupation, health condition,
health insurance coverage, social security number (Social Security number, Social Security Number, etc.),
occupation status (e.g., as a dependent on a government program),
race/ethnicity, language/race, religion/religion, political orientation, physical or
attainment of certain other characteristics, as well as other factors such as
physical or mental health conditions, including comorbidities like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, cancer and
diabetes mellitus (GERD-C), hypertension, diabetes/hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-related diseases (including
malaria, HIV/AIDS and HIV-1) and those with other chronic medical conditions (such as cancer or diabetes).
People with underlying chronic conditions are at greater risk than people without such conditions. For instance, for HIV, the mortality rate is higher among people living with HIV. However, there is no evidence that HIV can be transmitted from person to person through direct contact or through respiratory droplets produced by
persons. Therefore, transmission of HIV from persons with chronic illnesses is not a main
infection risk factor in this outbreak. It is therefore
impossible to know how many people in a population of more than 100,000 would be at increased risk for
high mortality if the transmission rate were to continue to increase. This is because the number of
individuals who develop severe disease from exposure to a single person is
much higher than in cases of influenza, tuberculosis and other respiratory
droplets. In addition, individuals with influenza and tuberculosis have a higher chance of developing
severe disease than do individuals without influenza or tuberculosis. Influenza is more
pathogenic than tuberculosis, while tuberculosis is less pathogenic. These
lines of transmission are not necessarily drawn
close to each other, but are instead drawn in different directions. Because the
differences in transmission risk are so large, it may be difficult to
understand how these differences in risk
can be explained in such a short period of time, given the limited information we have
about the human-to-human transmission patterns in
the context of this pandemic. Further research is needed to understand how
we can better understand and prevent the spread of these
coronaviruses and how to best protect ourselves and our loved ones from
these potentially devastating emergencies, both
and for those who may become ill from these diseases. WHO is working with partners
to develop strategies to minimize the impact on
our health system and on the lives of millions of people around the world
who are
affected by these devastating pandemics. To learn more, please click on WHO’s Manageability of Infectious Diseases (Managing
transmission) for more information on how the World Health Organization (WHO)
assesses and uses the latest information about the global health situation, COVID‑19 and
how to protect yourself and others against the new virus. Learn more about how WHO works with
non-governmental organizations to ensure that their activities are conducted in a manner
that is consistent with their mission and with the rights and obligations
of the people and their countries of origin (including the right to self-isolate). 
WHO works closely with health authorities in all
countries and territories affected by the outbreak to ensure their
responsibilities are proportionate and that they comply with international
protocols and international conventions on health
distancing and access to essential public health services. You should apply for and receive
travel documents as soon as possible to avoid rebooking your
visa for travel purposes. If you do not have travel documents, you should
consider postponing your return to your country of destination until the situation
has been resolved and your symptoms are no longer
serious. Travel documents should be accompanied by a copy of your passport
(if you have one), and at least two"
" The best way to protect yourself and your pet is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and then cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze.
If you have a fever or a cough, use a hand sanitizer to help relieve the cold and flu. If you are worried about the spread of the coronavirus, call your local health department or local public health authority and ask them to provide free and low-cost handshakes and hand hygiene products. You can also take a swab with you to the vet or veterinary clinic, where you can check on your health and well-being, to ensure you aren’t transmitting the virus to others.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" The main way the virus spreads is through respiratory droplets produced by a person coughing or sneezing. This is why it is important to wash your hands frequently with soap and water after using the bathroom, before eating, and before going to the grocery store. However, there are several viruses that can cause COVID-19, including the common cold, which causes fever, cough and shortness of breath. Therefore, washing hands regularly is a good idea, especially if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If you have any symptoms, seek medical attention immediately and call in advance to make arrangements to have a hand-washing session with your health care provider.

" The stimulus package includes $1.5 trillion in stimulus payments to states and localities, as well as $500 billion in loans to help pay for essential services, including food stamps, unemployment insurance, and the Children's Health Insurance Program. But it also includes a provision to extend unemployment benefits for up to six months to people who have lost their job due to the coronavirus outbreak. And it includes an additional $600 billion for the Pell Grants, which help families with pre-existing medical conditions receive aid.  

But there's a catch. If you've lost your job, you can apply for unemployment through your state or local agency. That means you'll have to wait until April 15 to get your check. The deadline for applying for a new job is April 30, but some states have already extended their deadline. So if you don't qualify, your application could be delayed or you could get kicked out of the program. You can still get the stimulus check, though, if your employer offers it to you instead of your ex or ex-spouse. It's unclear how much of that money will go toward helping people get back on their feet, or whether it will be used for other purposes, like paying for medical care or other essential needs. Some states are also offering job training programs, some of which are aimed at older adults and people with disabilities. [The Washington Post]
 [More from The Hill: How President Trump's travel ban affected the economy](https://www.thehindep.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/27/donald-trump-travel-ban-affected-economy/5078653001/)
The Hill has more: 


  “It’s a good idea to think ahead,” said Michael Froman, a professor at Georgetown University's School of Global Public Health who has spent his career studying the effects of economic shocks on the U.S. and global health system. ‘If you look at the stock market, for example, the S&amp;P 500 has gone from strength to strength in the last couple of years. They have been able to recover from the worst economic crisis since the Second World War and now they are in a stronger position than ever before to take risks and invest in things that are going to benefit them and help them grow. This is a very good time to be a risk taker and be prepared for what might come next. We need to have a plan in place to protect ourselves and our loved ones from this pandemic and protect the health and well-being of our children and grandchildren as much as we can. There is no doubt that the economic impact of this crisis will have an impact on our economy, our health care system, society and communities around the world.“
President Trump has ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a review of how it plans to clean up after the COVID-19 outbreak, to assess the risks posed by the virus and to make recommendations about how the agency can best protect itself and its communities. [...] The EPA has also instructed its employees to stay at home and clean surfaces with the use of hand sanitizer and other household cleaning products. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has instructed EPA employees not to touch personal protective equipment, such as masks, gloves and face coverings, unless it is necessary for work or personal use.
Trump's order also directs the EPA to begin issuing new guidance to businesses and individuals who are experiencing disruptions to their work, travel and business activities. Businesses are required to notify their employees and their family members by March 15, 2020, that they will no longer be allowed to work from 9 a.m. to midnight. Those employees are subject to a 15-day leave of absence order.

" Yes. The virus that causes COVID-19 can be passed from person to person through droplets from coughs or sneezes. It can also be transmitted through food, water, and other surfaces.

People who have the virus can shed it into their body, which can then transmit it to others. This is why it is important to wash your hands often and thoroughly with soap and water before and after touching your face, as well as using the bathroom or changing areas. If you are too sick to go to the doctor, you can try to get medical help by calling in advance, or visiting a local health authority. You should also check to make sure you have all the necessary documents, including your passport, health insurance number, social security number and any insurance numbers you may have.

" Coronavirus is a new virus that has been around since the beginning of time. It is thought to be mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

However, there are many other viruses that cause respiratory infections including the common cold, influenza, dengue, rabies, rubella, Zika, and SARS. These viruses can cause serious illness and even death. Therefore, it is important to regularly clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people you are close to. This means covering your mouth, nose and mouth with a tissue or cloth when you sneeze or cough. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority and local authorities to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone in your area.

" If you are worried about your child’s health or wellbeing, talk to them about the risks and benefits of social distancing.

If you have been in contact with someone who has been exposed to COVID-19, such as family members or close friends, it is important to ensure they have the information you need to make informed choices about how they can protect themselves and their loved ones. This information can be shared with the wider community and health authorities, and can include details of how the illness is managed, how symptoms are managed and when they begin to manifest. It can also include information on how to safely share personal information, including contact details, with people who may be at risk of developing or spreading the disease. You should also be aware that some local authorities may not be able to provide the same level of protection to everyone in your area, so you should consult with your local health authority to find out what additional measures are in place to help ensure everyone is safe and sound in relation to the spread of the coronavirus. For example, if you live in a major city or have a significant other's address, you may want to take extra precautions to avoid crowds, avoid public transport and avoid going out of your way to get close to people you know or care for. However, there are some important things to consider when deciding whether to move:


You should not leave your home to go out for a walk, jog or other activity that is likely to cause you or your loved one to become ill.  This includes:
Going to and from work, school and other public places,
Taking a short walk or bicycle ride (e.g. walking, cycling, walking on a designated path or trail, or using the public toilet or shared space)
Regularly and thoroughly cleaning your hands with a disinfectant or hand sanitiser
Keeping a distance of at least 1 metre (3 feet) between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing
Avoid public gatherings and gatherings where people are mingling or sharing food, drink and personal items
Do not go to a restaurant, bar or takeaway unless absolutely necessary to cover your cough and sneeze with an alcohol-based hand rub or a tissue or tissue soaked with soap and water (if possible).  If your health condition worsens, seek medical attention and call in advance to arrange a medical appointment, rather than waiting for the results of a test or referral to an early-stage diagnostic test centre. Talk to your healthcare provider about any changes to their advice, particularly if they are based on the latest case numbers and the extent to which they believe the situation is stable and that they would be willing to work with you to support you in any way you can. If they do not have any available specialist advice for you, call them and ask them to advise you on your options. They will be happy to give you the most up-to-date information as soon as possible. To learn more, see What is the current situation in the UK and what is available to you? and What are the restrictions and restrictions on travel, movement and importation of people from outside the EU? The Home Office has advice on this and will continue to update it as new information becomes available. See Advice for people living with HIV and those with other chronic conditions How can I protect myself and my family? for more information about protecting yourself, your family and others from the virus. The Prime Minister “announced today that the Government will provide £1.5bn in emergency funding for communities affected by the outbreak,” which will help protect vulnerable people and help them access essential services and supplies.

" I don't know about you, but I'd like to know if there are any studies which try to measure the effect of social distancing measures on people’s daily lives.  If so, what measures would you recommend to help people maintain social distance?  Or is there some other measure which can be used to reduce the risk of being infected by COVID-19, such as:
Regularly washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially if you are coughing or sneezing
Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your bent elbow or tissue
Cover your cough with a tissue and throw it away
Wear a mask and carry it with you whenever you go out
If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance
Take care to cover your mouth and nose with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (I use Hydroxychloroquine)
Practice hand hygiene and maintain good eye contact with people who are ill
Try to avoid public gatherings and gatherings where people congregate in groups (e.g. pubs, cinemas, restaurants, bars, clubs, etc.)
Consider postponing or slowing down trips to and from work, school, or other public places, as well as taking care not to touch your face, hands or face with objects that may be in your path
Stop going to the grocery store and buy groceries from a convenience store, and instead go to a fast-food restaurant and order a burger from there (if you can afford it, of course).
I'd also recommend taking a walk or bike ride every 15 minutes or so to get around and avoid crowds and traffic accidents. If you do this, you should aim to stay 6 feet away from anyone who is walking, biking or scurrying around, even if they are not in close proximity to you. You should also avoid crowded public transport, including buses, trains, planes and planes with passengers on board, so that you and your family can go wherever you need to go without having to worry about being bumped or swabbed by someone who might be passing them by. This will help keep you physically and mentally healthy while also reducing the chance of you getting sick and possibly exposing yourself to viruses that could be transmitted by others. I would also suggest staying up to date on all the latest news and information about the virus and how to protect yourself and others by following the links provided by the WHO and other WHO-recommended public health authorities. For example, here is a link to WHO's website: https://www.who.int/emergencies/public-health/diseases/2019-ncov/about/who-admits- 2019-novel-coronaviruses-in-the-community/how-to-protect-yourself-and- others/cdc/article/S1473-3099(20)30161-3/fulltext

" What is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from the COVID-2019? (source: CDC)
The CDC has developed a list of things you can do to reduce your risk of catching the virus.  These include:
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with soap and water
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth
Wear a mask when you are outside
Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or tissue
Take a swab from your nose or mouth and throw it in the trash
If you have fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance
Stay home if you feel unwell, stay home for at least 20 minutes, and avoid going to the doctor
Practice social distancing (self-isolation, isolation and isolation by phone, videochat, etc.)
Try to stay 2m (3ft) away from others, including family and friends
Talk with your doctor or other health care provider about any symptoms or concerns you may have, such as fever or a cough
Call your local health authority and ask them to take you to a doctor for a test or treatment
Consider postponing or cancelling trips to places you normally would have been able to go, or taking a bus or train to get to your place of work, school or clinic
Travel to and from work or school is a good idea, but it’s important to remember that you will not be allowed to leave your home unless absolutely necessary to care for someone else
Keep up to date with the latest news and information about the outbreak in your area, as well as any local coronavirus outbreaks
Monitor social media and news reports from affected areas to make sure they are not being used to disseminate information that could be harmful to you or others
Prepare meals and snacks that are safe to eat and are appropriate for children under the age of 5, to help them stay active and healthy
Have regular physical activity and maintain a regular distance from people who are ill or sick
Be active in school, work and recreational activities (such as running, cycling, hiking, swimming, yoga and other physical activities) that help you maintain physical and mental health
Encourage your children to play outside and play in parks and open spaces, especially playgrounds, so they can continue to learn about healthy ways to exercise and socialize


What are some of the recommendations for people living with HIV and those with other chronic conditions?  
How can I help protect myself and my loved one against the disease? What should I do if I suspect I may be at increased risk for serious illness or for having other serious health conditions that would seriously limit my ability to function in my current role as an educator, researcher, public health officer, health educator or researcher? Do I need to be on antiretrovirals (including the flu) or take any medicines? If so, what other preventive measures are there that I can take to prevent myself from developing any more severe illness and prevent others from contracting the infection? I would like to hear from anyone who has been in contact with someone who is currently or has recently been exposed to or is at higher risk to develop any of these conditions, whether or not they have HIV or are currently immunocompromised. I am interested in hearing what you think about these recommendations and what can be done to minimize their impact on your own health and well-being. Please feel free to reach out to me via e-mails, text messages or video chats, via phone calls or via the helpdesk.org channel on Facebook, Skype or Google+  and share your thoughts and concerns with me on this or any other important health issue.

" No. The virus that causes COVID-19 can be passed from person to person through droplets from coughs or sneezes. It can also be transmitted through food or drink.

If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.

" The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to be spread mainly through contact with respiratory droplets produced when someone coughs or sneezes.

However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said that it is not possible to know for certain how long a virus can survive on surfaces and is therefore not suitable for use as a vaccine.


The WHO says that: 
  “We do not know the full extent of human-to-human transmission,” the WHO said in a press release on Monday. It does not rule out the possibility of other viruses spreading from person to person, but it does advise that people should wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after touching a surface or object, before touching their eyes, nose or mouth and after eating or preparing food. People should also cover their mouths and noses with a tissue or tissue bag when they are ill, to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The WHO also recommends washing your hands often with alcohol or other hand sanitizer, as well as using alcohol-based hand rubs and hand hygiene products, such as wipes and toothbrushes. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance, according to WHO guidance on how to care for people who are sick with or have severe symptoms, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute disseminated respiratory infection (AQI), and chronic respiratory disease (CQD). For more information, see WHO’s Guidance for People Living with HIV and How to Protect Yourself from HIV and HIV-CoV (part of The Early Phase of HIV/AIDS: A Global Overview and Assessment of Preparedness and Response for the 21st Century).
WHO is working with partners including the Australian, British and French governments to develop a rapid and reliable vaccine and to assess the safety and efficacy of existing vaccines. WHO will continue to share updated information on the progress of its efforts and will update this article when new information becomes available.

" Yes, you should wear a mask to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.

CDC recommends wearing a cloth face covering when you are out and about, especially if you're visiting a medical facility. If you’re sick, cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from others who are sick or ill. You should also wash your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom and before going to the doctor or receiving care, to stop the spread of the coronavirus.


  “If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) chief.  But, he cautioned against using masks as a last-resort measure. The virus can survive on surfaces for days or weeks on hard surfaces, including cardboard, plastic and cardboard boxes. It can also be transmitted from person to person through droplets expelled from a person who has the virus. For most people, that means touching their eyes, nose or mouth. But some people can get the disease from touching objects or surfaces that are not their own, such as clothing, utensils and household items. And, if someone touches your face or hands, they may be at higher risk of catching the infection from someone else, according to a March 11, 2020 study in the journal Pediatrics.

And, for people who have recently become ill, wearing masks can be a good idea: The CDC recommends that people wear disposable medical masks, which can last up to two years in some cases. Other health organizations and medical professionals have also recommended that masks be reserved for health care workers and their families, as well as those with underlying medical conditions, like heart or lung disease or cancer patients who need to be hospitalized. Some states and local health departments are also encouraging people to wear masks for self-isolation and other nonmedical reasons, though that's not a recommended practice in most places, CDC officials say.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" We are currently in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused a global recession of over $100 billion.  

However, we are not alone in this situation, as many countries around the world are also experiencing severe shortages of essential services, including healthcare, essential medicines, and essential supplies such as medicines and medicines for the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions.


For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the situation in China is ""extremely critical"", and that ""the situation is expected to significantly worsen in coming weeks"".  In other words, it is very likely that China will be forced to close its entire medical facilities in order to meet the WHO's stated goal of reducing the number of cases worldwide by as much as 40%.  This would be a major blow to the global health system as it would significantly increase the risk of further global pandemics, especially in countries with relatively low levels of infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other chronic conditions like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, etc..  The WHO is also recommending that all countries work together to reduce their reliance on imported medical equipment and services (e.g. pumps, ventilators, blood banks, oxygen machines, electro-magnetic resonance spectrometers, ultrasound machines etc.), and to ensure that their existing systems are up to date and compliant with the latest standards of care and hygiene, to avoid unnecessary wastage of resources and unnecessary disruption to health systems and the health and well-being of people living with HIV and malaria patients. In addition, countries that have not yet implemented effective measures to contain the virus, or that are in a state of emergency, are likely to face significant economic, social and environmental costs as well as the potential for further economic and social disruption if they do not take decisive action to mitigate the risks posed by the current situation. This is particularly true in developing countries, where the impact on the economy and health of a country's response depends on how quickly and effectively the government intervenes to slow or halt the outbreak. For instance, in South Korea, a government shutdown in late January caused the country to lose more than $2 billion in economic output, while a nationwide lockdown in mid-March caused nearly $600 million in lost productivity and nearly a million people without access to basic services to begin to contract the disease. These are just a few examples of countries in which economic disruption could significantly impact the lives and livelihoods of millions of South Koreans and their affected communities. Governments should be prepared to respond to these situations by prioritizing the most vulnerable populations in their communities over those who are most at risk for serious illness and death. Countries should also take extraordinary precautions to protect themselves, their loved ones and others from the spread of COVID-2019. WHO has also issued guidance to all health care workers in affected countries to be on high alert for any signs of illness or a risk to themselves or others. It is therefore critical that they be aware of any possible travel restrictions, quarantine measures and/or other measures that may be put in place to limit their ability to travel to and from their country of residence. If you or someone you know is in close contact with a person who is seriously ill, for example by respiratory droplets or other bodily fluids, you should immediately call your local health authority immediately to make sure that you and your loved one are safe to go out and interact with others outside of your household. The most important thing you can do right now is stay home and avoid social gatherings and gatherings that could lead to direct contact between people who have been exposed to or have recently visited the affected area. You can find more information on WHO’s guidance on social distancing and contact tracing at: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronaviruses/2019-ncov/community-distancing-guidance-for-public-health- workers-in-affected-countries/external-sites/default-source/docid/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.01.022 (accessed March 20, 2020).

" If you are concerned about your health or the health of others, it is best to avoid touching your face, nose or mouth.

If you have a fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Call your local health authority and ask them to direct you to the right health facility. If possible, avoid socialising with people who are ill or have other health problems, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes or cancer. Talk to your healthcare provider about the situation and advise them whether you should cover your nose with a tissue or tissue from your hand, as this could increase the risk of catching the coronavirus.

" The coronavirus is a new virus that has not been seen in humans for more than a few months. It is thought to be mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets produced when a person coughs or sneezes. 

However, scientists are still trying to understand how this virus spreads and how it can cause illness. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned that the virus could cause serious illness in people up to 80 years of age and that people with underlying medical conditions, including heart disease, cancer and diabetes, should take extra precautions to protect themselves and their loved ones from COVID-19. WHO is advising people to stay at home and away from people they are close to, such as their children, their elderly or disabled family members, as well as those they have contact with. However, there is no evidence to suggest that any of these people are at higher risk of developing severe illness and death.


The WHO has also advised people not to touch their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands, and to avoid touching their face, which is covered in a thick covering called a “cloth” around their nose and mouth that covers their mouth and nose. People should also not carry any other personal items like a bag or purse with them or carry them around in their arms and legs, according to WHO. In addition, people should wear a mask when out in public and carry a medical thermometer (a device that measures temperature and relative humidity) in the back of their hand when walking, running or using the bathroom, a WHO statement said.

" The coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, has caused widespread disruption to the lives of thousands of people. WHO is assessing ongoing efforts to contain the virus, and will continue to share updated findings as soon as they become available. 


The WHO has also issued guidance to healthcare workers and their healthcare providers about the risk of COVID-19 spreading to others. It advises that all people with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection should practice good respiratory hygiene, including washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, before touching the body of someone who has the disease. People should also wear a mask if they are in close contact with people who have the illness, such as a close-fitting cloth mask, a disposable medical mask or a face mask with a rubber band around the front of it. The WHO also advises people to wear cloth face coverings when out in public, especially at night, when people are ill or sick with other respiratory illnesses.
People should wear gowns and gown-like clothing to cover their noses and mouth, avoid touching their eyes, coughs, sneezes and difficulty breathing. Avoid touching your face, nose or mouth with your hands, as well as your bent elbow or tissue.

" No. The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly spread through contact with respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has advised against touching your pet's mouth, nose or mouth with your hands, as this could expose the pet to potentially harmful respiratory viruses.


  A recent study in the journal PLOS One found that people who had been exposed to coronavirus had a significantly higher risk of developing a respiratory infection than did those who didn’t have the disease.  “The risk was higher among people with underlying medical conditions, including heart disease, cancer and diabetes,” said lead author Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Control at Penn Medicine. But, he cautioned that pets should not be touched or carried around the house, especially if they are sick with a common cold or are immunocompromised. ""If you have a sore throat, cough or difficulty breathing, pet owners should be on the lookout for ways to protect themselves and their loved ones from the potentially infectious virus,"" he told LiveScience.com. [See How Coronaviruses Spread](https://www.live.sciencemag.org/article/10.1126/science.aaa03665a) and other health care workers have been instructed to stay at least 6 feet away from pets that are in close contact, such as their owners, their family and others, and to wash their hands with soap and water before and after each visit, according to the WHO. In addition, people should avoid touching their eyes or nose, mouth or eyes, or their nose without a mask or other medical mask before going to a doctor or visiting a petting machine, said the study, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health (grants R01MH08953, R00MH07906 and R03MH09081).

" The government is encouraging people to stay at home and work, but it's not clear how long that will last.

The government has also said it will not be issuing refunds to people who have lost their jobs because of the coronavirus:


  “We’re going to do everything we can to help people,” Prime Minister Dominic Raab said in a televised address on Monday. He said the government would continue to provide support to vulnerable people and would work with local authorities to ensure they get the support they need.



  
But the prime minister is not alone in his concerns. A number of MPs have called for MPs to be given leave to work from home, or at least be allowed to leave the house to care for their sick family members, as a last-resort measure to protect the elderly and vulnerable.  In a letter to MPs on Sunday, the Royal College of Midwives warned that it would be ""extremely distressing"" for pregnant women to have to go out for antenatal appointments, and urged them to ""stay home"" as much as possible to minimise the risk of miscarriage and foetal abnormality, among other things. And in an interview with ITV's Newsbeat, Boris Johnson said that he was ""absolutely"" worried about the impact on the NHS of being forced to close its doors, despite the fact that ""our hospitals are the safest in the world"". He added that the ""worst thing that could happen"" to him and his family right now is that they could be forced out of work and into the care of a carer who has no connection to the public, because they have no choice but to self-isolate: ""If you have a heart condition, you can go to your GP and have your blood pressure checked and see what's going on. If you get a cold or a runny nose, call 999 and say, 'I'm sick, I need to get on with my life',"" he said. ""But if you're a mum and dad and you don't have any choice, it could seriously affect your wellbeing.""  And the Independent has reported that some people have resorted to using social distancing measures, such as using masks and hand-washing, to reduce their contact with their loved ones, in order to avoid being seen as pandemics-related. In the US, Governor-General Eric Harkins has ordered all state and local government departments to implement a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to COVID-19, with the aim of preventing it spreading to other populations, including schools, workplaces and public transport. But experts warn that such measures are likely to backfire if they are not implemented quickly enough, especially if the outbreak is contained and no-one is seriously ill. Dr. Jennifer Ashton, a visiting professor at the University of Washington's School of Global Public Health, says that people should be encouraged to use masks in public places, where they can be seen and heard, rather than in private homes. She adds that masks can also help stop people from spreading the virus to others, who may be at higher risk for catching it from someone else:  ""It's a good idea to wear a mask when you go into public spaces, not just in your own homes,"" she says. [BBC News, 11/12/2020]:  The WHO says it is ""aware of no evidence to support the use of face coverings for the purposes of public health"".  But the head of WHO's global health office, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has criticised the WHO for its ""ridiculous"" reliance on masks, saying it ""does not take seriously the need for masks to prevent the spread of infectious diseases"". [...] ""The WHO does not recommend that [people wear masks](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health/world-health-2020-03-26-face-coverings-recommended-for-public- health- workers-in-wales-countries-virus-2019-ncov-infection-symptoms-and-how-to-manage-body-mass-distancing-during-COVID19-prevent-spread-by-individual-persons-who-are-under-18-years-old-or-older-than-15-days-of-age) in countries where there is a significant increase in transmission"", according to a March WHO press release. [...] WHO recommends that all people in and around ""high-risk areas"" (i.e. areas with a high rate of transmission) be advised to wash their hands with soap and water and avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth. For people living in households with more than one person, this is particularly important: if more people are living with HIV, for example, washing their"
" No. The virus is not a virus. It is a family of viruses that have been around for thousands of years.

The virus that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2, and it is the same as the flu, except it has a different name.  The difference is that the virus can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, shortness of breath, runny nose, sore throat, joint pain, fatigue, dry cough, tiredness, aches and pains, loss of appetite, changes in temperature and other changes that can be caused by infection with other viruses.


  “It’s a very, very different virus,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in an interview with FoxNews.com. ""It's not like a flu virus.""  He added that there are some similarities between the two viruses, like the way they spread and how they can spread between people. But he cautioned against trying to get close to a person who is sick, because it could be harmful to you and could cause you to develop a temporary fever and difficulty breathing, which could lead to serious illness later on in life. He said that if you touch or touch your face or mouth with your hands or the back of your neck, for example, you could end up touching your eyes, nose and mouth, or possibly your mouth and nose. You could also be inhaling the droplets that are coming from the mouth or nose into your lungs and possibly into the airways, leading to an increased risk of developing a respiratory infection called anaphylactic shock. In addition, people who are immunocompromised may be at higher risk for severe illness, such as heart disease, stroke, cancer and diabetes, according to the World Health Organization.

" The stimulus package includes $1.5 trillion in stimulus payments to states and local governments, as well as $500 billion in loans to help pay for essential services, including food stamps, unemployment insurance, and the Children's Health Insurance Program. But it also includes sweeping changes to the way unemployment benefits are calculated, meaning that people who have lost their job, or have been laid off, will get a lump sum of money. The changes would apply to all Americans, not just those who are eligible for unemployment or the stimulus program.


The changes are part of a larger package of changes that Congress is expected to pass this week that would significantly tighten eligibility standards for millions of Americans who were kicked out of the labor force over the COVID-19 outbreak. Many of those affected by the pandemic are either employed or looking for work. Some have already applied for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) status, which allows them to stay in the US for up to 14 months after they've been on the job for at least 14 days. Those who've already been approved for this status could get another six months of work authorization before they start receiving their benefits. "
" Pets and wild animals can be carriers of the virus, including ticks, camels, racoons, cats, dogs, horses, and zebra finches.

If you are concerned about your pet or wild animal's health or wellbeing, you should seek medical attention and call in advance to make arrangements for a safe and regular return trip to your home. If you have symptoms, call your vet or local health authority and ask them to provide you with a medical certificate confirming your health and wellbeing.


What are the symptoms and how long should I be on antimalarial medicines?
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has advised that any person with symptoms should be taken to a vet for further treatment. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of any of these medicines can cause or contribute to the coronavirus's pathogenicity, so it is likely that you will need to take special precautions to protect yourself and others from the potentially dangerous side-effects of certain medicines.

" If you are worried about the spread of COVID-19, call your local health authority and ask them to provide you with advice and support.

If you have been in contact with someone who has been exposed to the virus, seek medical attention and call in advance to ensure they are not experiencing any symptoms and do not have fever, shortness of breath or other symptoms. If possible, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or tissue bag. Follow the directions of local authorities on how to protect yourself and your family from the new coronavirus.


The World Health Organisation (WHO) has advised against the use of face coverings, saying that people should not touch their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands. However, the WHO advises against touching your face, as this could expose you to potentially harmful respiratory viruses such as the common cold, which can be passed from person to person through respiratory droplets expelled by a person who is ill. WHO advice is to stay away from people with close contact to people who are ill, including those who have recently died, and to cover their mouth and nose with an appropriate cloth when they go to and from work, school or social occasions.  
 You should talk to your healthcare provider about any concerns you may have about how your health is being managed and how they can help to reduce the risk of catching and spreading the disease.

" The virus that causes COVID-19 can be passed from person to person through droplets produced when someone coughs or sneezes. It can also be transmitted through contact with objects or surfaces that are touched, such as a counter, a light switch, or a toothpaste dispenser. The World Health Organization (WHO) has advised against touching or touching any surface that has the virus on it, including your face, hands, and possibly your underwear. However, there is no evidence that touching, especially if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, can cause the disease. WHO recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after touching a surface or object, before going to a bathroom or changing room, to help protect themselves and others.
How can I protect myself? WHO urges people to stay at home if they feel unwell or have fever, cough or difficulty breathing. People should talk to their healthcare provider to talk about how they can reduce their risk for developing COV-2 infection.

" Yes, you can. But it’s important to be aware of the risks and precautions you should take to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.

CDC recommends that people wear a mask if they are in close contact with someone who has the virus. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance, according to the CDC. You should also wash your hands before and after touching your face or hands, as well as before eating or preparing food, to reduce the risk of catching the disease. 
 But some people who are ill or have underlying medical conditions can be at increased risk for serious illness. For people living with HIV or other HIV-related conditions, for example, breathing in droplets from a cough or sneeze is a good way to keep them at home and away from others, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is coordinating efforts to contain the outbreak. [See How to stay healthy while you're sick](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/health/coronaviruse- coronovirus.html) and is working with state and local health departments to develop guidance on how to safely and effectively cover your mouth and nose with a cloth or tissue when you are sick. And if you develop fever and cough, talk with your doctor or local public health official to talk about whether you need to use the bathroom or not. The CDC advises people to wash their hands often and cover their coughs and sneezes with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or wash them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, before touching their face, hands or face cover, in public or on the job or in a public place. People with underlying health conditions should not touch their eyes, nose or mouth without a medical mask, unless they have a fever or are taking medication that can prevent or treat the illness, such as ibuprofen, naproxen or hydroxychloroquine, which are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

" Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of prescription drugs for COVID-19. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that it is ""recommended that all persons living with HIV, as well as those with underlying medical conditions, be advised to regularly use essential medicines"".  WHO is working with partners including the WHO Regional Office of Infectious Diseases (ROHI) and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (ANHMC) to develop a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of routine and extended-release (ORE) medicines.

The WHO has also issued guidance to healthcare workers:


  Patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection should regularly and intramuscularly clean their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from others in the room.  This should be done in a manner that minimises contact with respiratory droplets and does not touch the eyes, nose, mouth, or respiratory tract. If hands are visibly dirty, disinfect them with household disinfectants and wash frequently touched surfaces with soap and water, including surfaces that have been hand-washing or disinfected with chlorofluorocaraffin (chloroquine) or other hand sanitizer (e.g., plastic, glass, paper, and paper towels).  These cleaning and disinfection practices should only be used when the patient is symptom-free and has not been exposed to any of the above-mentioned communicable diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, MERS, TB, malaria, cholera, influenza, adenoviruses, rubella, rabies, respiratory syncytial virus (rheumatic fever, acute respiratory distress syndrome, rhinovirus-like coronavirus, pneumonitis, hepatitis C virus or pneumopharyngeal reflux disease), acute myelitis (pneumonia), and influenza-associated respiratory infections (HIV-1, H1N1 or influenza A virus). Use of any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), including ibuprofen (Advil, Zoloft, Advil N-Pro, Remvil), naproxen (Valium), or aspirin (Prozac) is contraindicated for the symptomatic elderly and persons with comorbid respiratory conditions. If you are taking any medicines other than aspirin, diuretics or antacid medicines, ensure that you use them in accordance with your healthcare provider’s instructions and do not exceed 60 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity (i.e., no more than 20 minutes per day).

" Can I catch COVID-19 from someone who has the coronavirus and then spreads it to others through respiratory droplets from their nose or mouth? Is there any way to know if someone can catch the virus from a single person or is it spread through multiple people?  


If so, what are the symptoms? Are they similar to those of the common cold? What other symptoms do they cause? If not, how can I protect myself and protect others?
I'm wondering if there is a vaccine or a treatment that can prevent or cure the disease, and if so how effective would it be at preventing or treating it? Also, is there anything that I can do to minimize the risk of catching it from people who are not in the same category as myself, or are they more likely to spread it if they are in close contact with others who have the infection? I mean, if I was in a crowded environment, would I be more at risk for getting infected if my body temperature was higher than 70 degrees Fahrenheit? Or is this just a symptom of a more severe illness, like the flu, which is more contagious than the cold, but not as deadly as the other two diseases? Do any of us have similar immune systems, for example, the type of antibodies that protect us against the SARS-CoV-2 and the FIP-1, etc.?  Or are there other viruses that cause similar symptoms, e.g. Ebola, MERS, Ebola-like viruses or the Zika virus, that are more infectious than Ebola? Thanks in advance for your suggestions!

" Yes, but only if you filed it with the IRS on or before March 30, 2020. 

If you have a pre-tax return, you should be able to get a check for the amount you paid, even if it was not claimed as a “tax refund”. However, that’s not the best way to begin your application for a tax refund. You should contact your state or local taxing authority and ask about the status of your return and whether it will be subject to refund under the CARES Act, which requires that you file it within 60 days of the due date. The IRS has guidance for filing returns, however, and some states have passed laws that allow you to delay filing your returns for up to 90 days after filing, so you may want to consider filing a timely filed return as soon as you can, rather than waiting for it to be turned over to your local IRS office. If you do not file your taxes by that date, it is best to file the return within the 90-day period that begins on the date you claimed it as your taxable income, whichever is later.
 Some states, such as New York and California, have taken steps to allow people who have claimed their home-based deduction to refinance their existing tax filers, though that does not mean that they will have to pay any additional income taxes on their adjusted gross income. For more information on this, see How much income can I get back from my home state if I file my taxes in another state?


The IRS is currently working on a set of rules that will allow individuals who filed their 2017 or 2018 tax returns in the same year to claim the deduction for 2018 and 2019 taxes, as well as any extensions of tax credits they may have. It is unclear at this time how long the rules will last, or how many people will get their tax refunds. In general, individuals should file their taxes as they normally would, regardless of whether they filed them in 2016 or 2017, to avoid any potential loss of income due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

" What is the current status of coronavirus testing in China and how can I protect myself and others against the disease? (China has tested a large number of people, but the vast majority of those have been in isolation, and none of them have died.)  (The CDC has a list of tests that it says are safe to use, though, so I'm not sure if it's the same as the WHO's list, or if they're just different in that they use different numbers for different purposes.  I'd also like to know if there are any guidelines for how long people can be tested, given that some countries have tested people for more than a few days, while others have not tested at all, e.g. Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, the US, China, Iran, Qatar, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, Slovenia, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland (all of which are in quarantine) for at least 14 days) to be 100% certain that their symptoms don't develop into a severe illness, even though they may have fever, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, runny nose, dry cough or other symptoms, etc.).  If you have symptoms and are worried about getting sick again, you should call your doctor or local public health authority and ask them to provide you with a test kit, which should include:  
a blood test, a CT scan, blood sample, swabbing, X-ray, ultrasound, electroencephalography (EEG) and/or biopsies (in case you develop a viral infection).  The tests should be done in a hospital setting, with no access to public healthcare facilities and no risk factors for exposure to people who may be at higher risk of developing a serious illness. The test kits should also be kept separate from everyday items, such as hand sanitizer, toothpaste, washable wipes and toothbrushes, as well as personal protective equipment like gloves, masks and gloves with which to wear when you are not in close contact with anyone who might have a respiratory infection, for example, someone who is coughing or sneezing and who has recently been exposed to respiratory droplets from a person with respiratory disease (such as those who have recently developed a fever or cough).
You should talk to your healthcare provider about any restrictions on travel, movement or movement restrictions that may apply to you and your family, including:
requiring you to self-isolate (i.e. stay at home, avoid public transport, stay in separate rooms, not share personal items like food, drink etc., etc.), and
being accompanied by a health care provider who can provide care for you (if you need to get medical care, call in advance and arrange for a stay-at-home visit).

" What is the best way to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 in the event of an outbreak in your home country? Is there a vaccine or treatment that can prevent or cure the disease in a way that is safe and effective for all people living in that country, including those who are exposed to it? What are the health and safety features of vaccines and treatments that are currently under development in countries around the world, and how can they be used safely and effectively to prevent, cure and prevent COV-like diseases?  What other health services and organizations are working on developing and implementing effective vaccines, treatments and vaccines for the many infectious diseases that pose a risk to people and the wider community? How can governments and health authorities develop and implement effective preventive and treatment strategies to reduce the risk of serious disease and protect the lives of vulnerable populations in developing countries? Do countries with high transmission rates, such as China, Iran, South Korea and some African countries, have enough resources and expertise to effectively manage outbreaks in their own populations, or are they at risk for serious human-to-human transmission from a country that has not yet been fully eradicated? Are there any recommendations or guidelines for countries to take seriously the risks posed by the current pandemic, as well as the ways in which countries can protect themselves and their communities from the virus? If so, what are some key areas that countries should focus on in order to avoid the most serious and deadly pandemics, while also reducing the number of others that may be on the path to becoming seriously ill?

" There are a number of reasons why you might want to postpone your trip to the US. First, the virus is spreading faster than most other coronaviruses, meaning that it is more difficult to catch it from people who have not been exposed to it. Second, there are restrictions on travel to and from countries affected by the outbreak, which means that you would have to stay in hotels, not go anywhere else. Third, as with most infectious diseases, you will need to get medical care. Fourth, some countries, like Italy and Spain, have closed their borders to foreigners, but that does not mean that they will stop trying to stop you from going there. Fifth, countries like China and South Korea are doing a good job of keeping infected people out of their country of residence, even if they do not know you are one of them. And finally, travel restrictions are being put in place to prevent people from traveling to countries that are not in quarantine, such as Germany, Austria, France, Italy, Singapore, and the Netherlands. 
So, what should you do if you have been in a country that has been quarantined for a long time and are now experiencing a sudden drop in cases?  Or are you worried about going back to your home country and infecting others in the future? If so, how do you plan to protect yourself and your loved ones while avoiding the spread of this virus? Do you think you should stay at home and avoid contact with others who may be at higher risk of catching it, or is there a better way to deal with this risk than going to a place where the risk is higher and riskier? I am not an expert in this area, so I don't have the answers to these questions directly. I would suggest reading the WHO's guidance on this matter and consulting a qualified public health professional to find out what you can and cannot do to avoid catching the disease, including:
What precautions should be taken to ensure the health and well-being of people in your household during this time? What precautions are recommended for people living in or visiting areas with higher transmission risk? How can you ensure that your children and grandchildren are safe to go to school, work, play, visit friends and family, exercise, etc.?
If you feel you or someone you know is at high risk for catching this new virus, seek medical attention and call in advance to make arrangements for your child or grandparent to visit a local hospital or other health care facility. If possible, make sure you wear a mask and wash your hands with soap and water before and after touching your face, nose, mouth or eyes. Do not touch your eyes or nose with a tissue or tissue and cover your mouth with the back of your hand when you cough or sneeze. Follow the directions of local health authorities and local authorities for any restrictions you may have on your movement and travel. This includes: If you and others are in close contact, avoid touching each other's mouths, noses or noses with hands that have recently been touched by someone who is ill or has recently visited another country. Why? This could include: Why are people so contagious? Why aren't they showing signs of illness? Are there any symptoms that could lead to you being infected? Is there evidence that this is happening in some way, e.g. through respiratory droplets, sneezing or possibly other respiratory illnesses? These are just a few examples of things that can happen in and around a person's body during a period of time when the body is not functioning normally.

" I have a question about the coronavirus. 

I live in the US and my wife is a US citizen. She is pregnant and has been in contact with US citizens for over 3 years. We have been friends for a few years and she is currently traveling to China to be with her US-born biological mother. I am wondering if I can get a Social Security Number (SSN) or a driver's license for her to use as proof of citizenship. Is there any way to verify my SSN and/or driver’ license before I apply for the EIDL? If not, how can I prove my status and eligibility to receive the benefits?  I would like to know how my spouse and I could verify each other's SSNs and prove that we are both citizens of the United States at the time of our application. If we do not have such a document, would it be best to contact the USCIS Office of Inspector General (OIG) and ask them to provide me with a copy of their Form I-94 or Form 1099 for each application, along with any required documents and proof that I meet the eligibility requirements of my current employment status (i.e., I was employed for at least 30 days prior to my application being denied, etc.).  If the OIG does not provide such documents to me, is it possible to request a Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to extend my Status of Residence (temporary) for another 14 months, or does it not make sense to wait until the end of her current term of employment before applying for OPT?


Thank you in advance!   Thanks for your suggestions!
  *I* am not a citizen, so I don't know what to do about her status. But, I do know that she should be able to apply to OPT and receive benefits, as long as she meets the following criteria:
She has not been physically present within the last 14 days,
Has not engaged in any form of organized or personal activity that substantially damages the health or safety of others (e.g.,
Is in a position of authority over a person other than her spouse or dependent),
Does not pose a risk to the welfare or well-being of another person beyond her immediate family or household (including
children or
persons with whom she has a physical or mental health condition that would substantially impair her ability to perform her duties as a
person or to maintain a regular routine of daily living, including
(1) maintaining a household income of less than $75,000, (2) having no other income, and (3) being unable to work due to a medical condition or other
concerning which the Secretary determines that the individual is
eligible for assistance under section 212(a)(3)(B)(ii)(II), or (4) of this Act (42 U.S.C. 1395dd-1397a-3)).
The Secretary may, at his or her discretion, direct that an application for Extension of Status be considered OPT, even if the application was
substantially
impairing the status of a bona fide
qualifying nonimmigrant status, provided that: (A) the applicant has
sufficient documentation to demonstrate that her bona fides
were substantially equivalent to that of an alien who
was unlawfully present during the 14-day period preceding her
application for
extension of status; (B) her application is not frivolous and
is not inadmissible in whole or in part because of
the applicant's
relief from the restrictions imposed by the
Appendix B
Notice of Extension; and [[Page 130 STAT. 2158]] (C) there is no
frivolous or frivolous cause of action for failure to timely
apply for an extension of stay or for relief under this
Act.
In addition, she must
have a valid and valid work authorization (such as
passport, permanent resident alien identification number)
issued by a government agency or an
immigrant-for-immigrant (immigrants with lawful permanent
resident status) within 90 days after she
refuses to continue her employment, unless the alien
continues to engage in
nonimmigrant activities, except as provided in subsection (g)(2)(A)(i)

 



 I understand that a temporary extension is granted to an applicant who is otherwise
unable to return to her country of residence for reasons
that are substantially related to
immigration violations, but I wonder if it would be
reasonable for me to delay her return until after the expiration
of her OPT status to avoid the need for further
extraordinary circumstances, such as medical reasons? I
think that, in general, a stay of OPT would not
necessarily be necessary to prevent her from
remain in her home country for more than 14
days at any given time, given the fact that
her status is valid for"

The Organization estimates that the global economy will contract by an average of about 1.5 percent this year, and the number of people who contract the disease will overwhelm the health system in developing countries.  This will have a ripple effect throughout the economy, with countries that rely on imported goods and services (e.g., the U.S., China, Italy, Japan and South Korea) and those that depend on domestic production of essential goods, such as milk and meat, going into a recession will see their economies contract at a faster rate than they would have under a more severe economic crisis.


The ODI's projections are based on data collected by the World Health Organization (WHO) between January 1 and March 31, 2020. The data was collected in response to a request by WHO to share information about the extent to which countries around the world have implemented effective measures to contain the virus. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a press briefing on March 30 that he expects the data to be ""very accurate"" and that it will provide ""a good starting point"" for countries to take effective action to reduce the risk of future pandemics. However, he cautioned that ""it is not yet clear how accurate these estimates will be.""  He added that countries should continue to monitor their health systems for signs of infection and ""implement ways to slow or eliminate the spread of this disease in order to minimize the economic impact on vulnerable populations and to help prevent future outbreaks from spreading to their neighbors and their communities.""
In addition, the WHO has also issued guidance to health care workers and other public health officials regarding the use of social distancing measures, which are intended to prevent people from mingling with others in public and private settings. In particular, WHO recommends that workers wear masks if they are in close contact with someone who has been exposed to or has recently visited a person with a suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, as well as hand sanitizer if the person is coughing or sneezing frequently. Workers should also wash their hands frequently with soap and water after touching their face, nose or mouth, or hands, to disinfect contaminated surfaces, including their clothing and personal protective equipment, before and during work and in connection with work, in addition to regular hand hygiene.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

" Can I get tested for COVID-19 if I have a fever, cough, or shortness of breath, such as a sore throat, nasal congestion, a runny nose or a burning sensation in the eyes? 
If so, what should I do to protect myself and my loved ones from the virus that is spreading from animals and humans to people in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and other parts of China, as well as other cities and towns in China that have been hit hard by the outbreak? I am a Chinese citizen living in a US state of residence and have no connection to China. Should I be tested and/or given the same tests as my Chinese and US-born Chinese-American neighbors, who are also citizens of the US at the time of this writing? Also, is there any way to know if someone who has been in contact with an infected person in another country (e.g. through the internet) is at higher risk of being infected in that country? Do I need to stay at least 6 feet away from anyone who is in my household for this to be considered a ""high risk"" (i.e., I'm not even sure if my neighbor is infected)?   I wonder if there is any legal basis for testing people who have recently traveled to a foreign country and then return to their home country, in order to determine if they are at high risk for exposure to this new virus? Or is it more likely that the person who tested positive is an American citizen who recently returned from a trip to an overseas country where the travel ban was lifted and now lives there with his family and does not have to worry about the ban being lifted for the next few months (as long as he has not been abroad for more than 14 days)?

" The two viruses share a common pathogen called SARS-CoV-2, which causes the common cold. The virus is thought to spread primarily from person to person through droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can also be transmitted through contact with bodily fluids, such as mucus, saliva or vomit.

However, scientists are still trying to understand exactly how the virus spreads, and how it spreads between people. For example, the World Health Organization has said that it is not possible to know how many people have the disease because of the small number of people who can be infected. However, there are currently no known cases in the U.S. and no deaths have been reported in China.


  “We don’t know the full extent of this virus,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. But he cautioned against extrapolating too much from a single case to the spread of a new disease. 
“If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, you may be at higher risk of getting coronavirus. That's why we need to be on the lookout for new ways to protect ourselves and our loved ones from this potentially deadly virus. And that includes taking good care to wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your face, nose or mouth. ”
 The WHO says that people should wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before touching their face or nose, before eating or preparing food, or before going to a doctor. If you are sick with the flu, use the same bathroom and bathroom facilities as the person who contracted it, as recommended by your healthcare provider. Follow the directions of your local health authority, including the local laws and regulations that apply to your area, to ensure that you and your loved one are safe to go out and interact with others.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" The CDC recommends that people stay home if they feel unwell for more than 24 hours. However, that does not mean that you should not seek medical attention for COVID-19 symptoms. Instead, call your health care provider and talk with your healthcare provider about any concerns you may have. If you have fever, cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing, the CDC advises staying home and taking proper precautions to protect yourself and others. <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" The Department of State has issued guidance on repatriation of body parts, but it does not specify when they can be repatriated. 

For example, if you are a U.S. citizen and you have been abroad for 14 days, you may be able to return to your home country without a visa. However, it is important to note that you must be physically present at the time of your return, and that your travel history is not a factor in determining whether you should be allowed to leave your country of residence at this time. You may also be required to self-isolate, which could limit your ability to travel to and from the affected area.


  In light of the recent outbreak in Wuhan, we are asking all Americans to stay home as much as possible,” the State Department said in a news release. ""This includes staying at least 6 feet away from anyone who is in close contact with someone who has been exposed to or is currently at risk of contracting the coronavirus,"" it adds, adding that Americans should ""keep all essential travel documents and travel insurance, including Social Security numbers, in order to avoid traveling to places with the highest transmission rates in the world.""  The guidance also recommends that travelers who have recently returned from overseas travel for medical reasons, such as to care for a loved one or as a carer, should wear a face mask, wash their hands frequently and avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth, the CDC says.
 But the guidance doesn’t provide specific guidelines for how long you can stay at home, nor does it provide any guidance about what kind of personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear to protect yourself and others during the trip. It does, however, advise that people who are ""extremely ill or severely ill"" should regularly wear masks, as recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) in its Guidance for Patients with Pneumonia and Infectious Acute Respiratory Syndrome (CAIRS).  PPE is a type of medical mask that is commonly used by health care workers to disinfect contaminated surfaces and prevent spread of respiratory droplets from infected patients to others. The ACOG says that masks should only be used if the person wearing them is clinically ill, or if they are not in good physical condition to be effective against the virus. For more information on how masks work, see this CDC post: How to Use a Mask to Protect Yourself and Others.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><

" What is the best way to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 and other respiratory infections?

The WHO has developed a range of recommendations to help protect people and businesses from the virus. These include personal protective equipment (PPE), respiratory masks, hand sanitizer and hand hygiene products. But there are still many unknowns about the health effects of these products, and how effective they are at preventing or treating the disease. WHO is working with health authorities around the world to develop guidance and action plans that can be implemented effectively to prevent, detect and treat the 2019-nCoV outbreak.

" It’s not entirely clear what factors contribute to the current reluctance of people to travel to and from the United States. Some studies suggest that travel restrictions may be effective in slowing the spread of the virus, but there is no evidence to support that.

For example, in a study of more than 1,000 U.S. adults, researchers found that only about 1 in 5 (1%) of those who tested positive for the coronavirus were able to return to their home countries after being tested, suggesting that restrictions on travel are not as effective as some other measures.


  “There is a lot of misinformation out there,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study. ‘We need to be very clear about what we mean when we say that we are trying to reduce the transmission of this virus and that is not just about the travel ban. This is about how we protect ourselves and our loved ones from this disease and protect the health and well-being of others around the world. And that includes the ability to stay home and not go out of our way to get tested and to avoid contact with people who might be sick. That includes social distancing, not going out and mingling with other people, and staying away from places where the risk of catching the disease is higher. So there are some things we can and should be doing to help people stay healthy and stay at home. But we also have to remember that the vast majority of cases in this outbreak are mild or no symptoms at all. They are just travelers who have been to a country or region that has been hit hard by a pandemic and they have not been exposed to any other risk factors that could put them at greater risk for transmission.  And if you are in that situation, you should take precautions to protect yourself and others, including staying home, avoiding social gatherings and socializing with family members and friends. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Stay home as much as you can until you feel well and no longer have any symptoms. Talk to your doctor or other health care provider about any concerns you may have and ask about traveling to or from a region with a high rate of transmission, such as China, which has the second-highest case fatality rate among developed countries, according to WHO. For people living in or visiting countries with high transmission rates, it is important to maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between themselves and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. WHO recommends that people wear a mask when out in public, especially if they are ill or have respiratory problems. People should also wash their hands frequently with soap and water, avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth, cover their cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain 6 feet (2 mio.ft.) distance from others when walking, running or using the subway. Avoid touching your face or hands with unwashed hands, as this could expose your hands to potentially contaminated surfaces. Follow the directions of local health authorities and local public health officials on how to safely and effectively cover your cough, sneeze and shortness of breath with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or hand rub. Do not touch or expose yourself to objects or surfaces that are potentially infectious to you or others. Why? The World Health Organization (WHO) has advised against touching, inhaling or touching bodily fluids or objects that have the potential to transmit the illness to others (e.g., surfaces, objects, people or things). WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways the outbreak spreads and will continue to share new findings.

" Yes, but only if they are over the age of 60. 

If you are not over 60, you can still go out for a walk, go to a park or go shopping. But you should wear a mask and carry a medical mask with you when you leave the house. You should also wash your hands before and after touching your mask, as washing with soap and water can cause the virus to enter your body and cause you to cough and sneeze. If you have fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance, the CDC advises.
You can get tested for COVID-19 by a health care provider, who can give you a test if symptoms persist for more than 24 hours. However, if you develop symptoms after being tested, call your doctor or local public health authority and ask them to provide you with medical care. The World Health Organisation advises that people should not touch their face, nose or mouth with their hands or face coverings, unless they have a fever or are in a state of high risk for developing a respiratory infection.

" We don't have data for that, but the CDC says that the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. is about the same as in China, and that there are about 1.5 million people living with HIV who are not being tested.

" The CDC recommends that people over the age of 60 be tested for COVID-19 if they have fever, cough, shortness of breath, or are in a state of ""high fever and/or body aches and pains.""

However, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't get tested.  If you have symptoms, call your doctor or local health department to be on the lookout for any signs of illness, including any changes in your body temperature, such as a change in temperature or temperature changes to your eyes, nose, mouth or throat. You should also wash your hands often with soap and water if you're feeling sick. And be sure to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from others who are ill.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" What is the best way to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 in the event of an outbreak of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) in 2019-nCov (2019 novel novel case?):


Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially if you are coughing or sneezing. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority, including local guidance on how to stay healthy and cover your cough with a tissue or tissue bag. Avoid close contact with people who are ill or have other health problems, such as family members or close friends. Take special care not to touch your face, nose or mouth with your hand, as this could expose you to potentially infected respiratory droplets. Wear a mask when out in public or at work, and avoid touching objects or surfaces that are not in your direct line of sight (e.g. a window sill, countertop, cabinet or cabinet). If possible, wash hands before, during and after your visit to a health facility or clinic, to reduce the risk of catching the virus and spreading it to others. Do not touch or carry any personal items that you carry with you, unless they are in a public place or are visibly distancing themselves from other people. Keep up to date on local and state and local public health advisories on the most important things to avoid while out and about (such as when to leave your vehicle, where to go for public transport, when and how long to get medical care, etc.).
What are some tips for people living with or caring for someone who is seriously ill, or who has recently died, who should not be touched or carried around by their close family member, except in extreme circumstances?

" There is no evidence that viruses can be engineered to cause COVID-19. 

The main difference between viruses and plants is that they are very similar in structure and function. For example, SARS-CoV-2 is a very closely related virus to the common cold, while MERS is much less so. The main differences between these viruses are in their ability to replicate in the environment and in how they can survive on surfaces. These differences are important to understand as well as to develop effective treatments and vaccines.

" There are a few key differences between the two approaches. The first is that the WHO is a non-governmental body, not a government body. It does not have powers to make recommendations, and it has no authority to impose travel bans, quarantines, or deportations. Its only powers are to advise and direct the health authorities on how to deal with the pandemic.

In contrast, the COVID-19 response has been led by WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, a former French prime minister. He is now the head of WHO's Global Public Health Programme, which is chaired by former US Vice President Dick Cheney. His successor, Michel Navarro, is expected to be appointed by President Trump shortly after he takes office on Jan 20th, 2020. Mr. Trump's administration has also been criticised for its reluctance to use the term ""Wuhan Virus"", which critics say is an over-the-top nickname for a virus that has killed more than 2,000 people worldwide since it was first identified in 1976. (The WHO did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it had used that term in its press releases, nor did it issue a press release in response to questions about its methodology for naming such a disease.)  




  “We’ve had a very successful response,” said Mr Trump in a televised address, adding that he would use it as a template for other international efforts to fight the disease, including the World Health Organization and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). ‘We have a lot of work ahead of us, but we are going to do everything in our power to stop this virus from spreading to other people. This is not about politics, this is about defeating this disease and slowing it down. ”
 But he also stressed the need for countries to take decisive action, saying that if they fail to act quickly, it could lead to ""catastrophic consequences"" for millions of people who depend on food, medicine and medicine-related services.  He added that countries would have to work together to contain the outbreak, noting that ""our friends and allies"" in Europe and North America would also be at risk if the situation worsens in their country of residence. ""We will take care to protect our borders, our health systems and our economies,"" he said. [emphasis added]
So, what exactly does this mean for US President Donald Trump and his administration? The WHO has a long history of being critical of US foreign policy, with its focus on the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia. But it seems unlikely that Trump himself would be opposed to using the name of a global public health threat, given that his own administration is largely composed of former Republican politicians and their family members. So far, however, he has not taken any direct action against US-based groups or individuals, such as the White House Council of Economic Advisers or the Council on Global Development, despite the fact that they have been active in opposing US policies and actions that have significantly affected the global economy. As far as he is aware, there is no official WHO position on this, although the organization's director general, Olivier Blanchard, has stated in an interview with French radio station L'Enfant terribleit pour la Republikaire (NPR's French service) that there are ""no official recommendations on human-to-human transmission"" and that such actions should be taken ""with the utmost seriousness"".  In other words, while he may not be directly advocating for or against any particular US administration's actions, his comments seem to suggest that"
" I'm a PhD student in epidemiology at the University of Waterloo. My advisor is a professor of virology. She's been working on a novel coronavirus vaccine for the past few years. The vaccine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is being tested on animals.  Her advisor has also been testing the vaccine on humans, including a recent study of a patient in China who developed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) who had been exposed to a live attenuated strain of SARS and was later diagnosed with a severe respiratory infection. This patient was also recently tested for S. rhinovirus, which has caused a global pandemic since it first emerged in 2003. What are the current safety and efficacy of this new vaccine candidate?  I've been wondering this question for a while now, so I thought I'd share my own thoughts on this and other similar questions on StackExchange. I know that many of you are wondering about the safety of vaccines, especially vaccines that have been around for quite some time (e.g. polio vaccine, MMRV, etc.), but I think that there are many important questions that need answering. For example, are there any vaccine candidates that are safe and effective against the most common viral infections, such as the common cold, influenza or other respiratory diseases? Or, if so, how effective are they at preventing or treating the many more common diseases that cause serious illness? Also, do vaccines have any known side effects, like immunity, immunity to other viruses or the like, that would prevent them from causing any serious health problems? (I'm not an expert in this sort of thing, though.)  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!  (Edit: I also want to point out that my advisor's question is about a different type of vaccine than mine,"
" There is no evidence that fever is a risk factor for COVID-19 infection. However, it is important to keep in mind that the risk of infection is not limited to the United States. For more information, see CDC’s Guidance for Health Care Professionals on How to Protect Yourself and Your Health.

CDC recommends that people with underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer or cancer, take antihypertensive medications (such as ibuprofen, naproxen or hydroxychloroquine) to help manage symptoms. These medications can cause side effects, including fever, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Learn more about how your health care provider can protect you and protect your family.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" Yes, you can. There are a number of different ways to make your own bleach. Here are some of the ways:

Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use alcohol-based hand rub if you’re concerned about the risk of catching COVID-19.
Take a bleach solution and mix it with water and bleach, then add your desired amount of bleach to the water, mixing it well. If you have a high-sodium diethylamide solution, add 1/3 cup bleach per gallon of water. 
If you're concerned that you may be exposing your child to potentially dangerous coronavirus, use a disinfecting solution (e.g., Sodium hypochlorite) or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (like ibuprofen) to help protect yourself and others from the virus. (See How to Wash Your Hands with Bleach for more information on how to safely use bleach.)
Use a disposable disposable mask or disposable cloth mask with the bleach on it, and wipe down any dirt or debris that may have accumulated on your face, nose or mouth. Then, cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you are not using it as a source of heat or heat. Use a tissue to hold your mask in place, so that it does not touch your eyes or nose. Place the mask on the countertop of your vehicle, where it is most comfortable for you to sit.


To make homemade bleach:   1 cup (240 ml) bleach
1/2 cup water
2 teaspoons baking soda
3/4 teaspoons (1 stick) salt
Directions
In a large mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients except for bleach and let it steep for 20-30 seconds. Let the mixture cool completely before transferring to a clean, dry, plastic container. You can also add a teaspoon or two of powdered oxy-bleach or any other cleanser to keep it at room temperature for longer periods of time, but I prefer to store it in a cool, dark place where I can wash it when I am not looking at it from my room window or using the bathroom. I also like to use plastic wrap to protect myself from viruses and other germs that might be on my hands or in the air. Spray the container with non-porous water if the surface is visibly dirty or covered in dirt and debris. Seal the lid with Velcro or other fastened fastening devices to prevent the viruses from contaminating the plastic or metal. When the containers are empty, place them in an air-conditioned room where they can be easily cleaned and disinfected using household products, such as wipes and toothbrushes, according to CDC Tips for Cleaning and Disinfecting Personal Care Products (PCP).
For cleaning products that are intended to be used by healthcare workers, including masks and face masks, the CDC recommends using a product that has been scientifically proven safe and effective for cleaning hands and body fluids. The CDC recommends that all products manufactured after January 1, 2020, be manufactured and distributed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has also issued guidance on the safe use of household bleach for personal care products. Learn more about how cleaning hand hygiene products can be safer and more tips to protect your health and protect against COVID‑19 from the contaminated products.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"

" There are currently no published data to support the claim that SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus. However, a recent study published in the journal Science Advances suggests that the virus may have originated in bats. The study, which was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), is the first to use a bat model to model the evolution of the new virus. It is based on data collected from bats in Wuhan, China, and from other bat species, including the common bat Coronaviridae (Crown Spaniel), the bat Rhinolophus macaques (Macaca mulatta), and the bats Sars and Coenorhabditis elegans (Coleoptera). The authors suggest that this study may shed light on the origins of this new pathogen.

" There is no evidence that the coronavirus can be transmitted through contact with bodily fluids. However, it is thought to be spread through respiratory droplets expelled by a person who is coughing or sneezing. The risk of transmission is low, with only a small amount of cases reported in the UK and Ireland, and no deaths have been recorded in those countries. WHO is assessing ongoing research to understand the full extent of human-to-human transmission and will continue to share updated findings.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"
" What is the current status of COVID-19 in the U.S. and how can I protect myself and my family against the virus that is killing millions of people every year? 
 I live in a rural area in western New York state. My wife and I have two young children. Our house is on the top floor of a building that houses the state Department of Health and Human Services. The building is surrounded by a fence and a large, open-air swimming pool. We have been told to stay at least 6 feet away from anyone who has been to our house in recent weeks, and to wash their hands with soap and water if they are ill.  We are also being told not to touch our pets, who are not allowed inside the house, except for their coats and coats of arms. All of this is in stark contrast to the lockdown in Washington, D.C., which has left hundreds of thousands of Americans without access to basic necessities, including food, water, medicine and basic medical care, despite the fact that more than 100,000 Americans have died from the disease so far this year alone. How can we protect ourselves and our family from this deadly virus, especially when the federal government is closing schools, hospitals and other public facilities, shutting down entire cities and towns, banning travel to and from places with high rates of infection? What are the best ways to protect yourself and your family while protecting the health and well-being of the people who live and work in our community?


I am a single mother living with my partner and three young kids, both of whom are recovering from severe illness and are worried about the impact this outbreak will have on them and their loved ones. I want to help them understand the challenges they face and the ways they can take care of themselves while also respecting the rights of others to live independently, work and care for them as they see fit, without fear of being labeled a ""pussycat"" or ""hatchet man.""  I'm asking these questions because I believe in family values, respect for elders and being a responsible parent, not because of who we are as a family, but because we care about each other as much as we can. If we don't act now, our children will continue to suffer and we will be in dire straits for the rest of our lives if we do not take the steps we need to take now to make our communities a safer place to raise them, protect them from disease and prevent it from spreading to others as it has in previous outbreaks. This is especially true for pregnant women and people of childbearing age, as well as those with underlying medical conditions who may be at higher risk for serious illness or death if their unborn child is born prematurely, or those who have preexisting conditions like heart disease, diabetes, lung disease or other chronic conditions that limit the ability of their pregnant or pre-pregnant women to breastfeed or deliver a child. These are serious and life-threatening situations that must be addressed quickly and effectively, whether by government or private health care providers or local public health officials. It is important to recognize that there is no single answer to this crisis, so it is best to work with local, state and local health authorities to develop strategies and resources to support healthy family relationships and ensure that everyone is safe and sound in their homes and workplaces.

" What is the current status of the COVID-19 lockdown in the UK?
The UK government has said that it will continue to provide support to people affected by the outbreak, as long as they are able to leave the country within 14 days of returning home. It is unclear how long the lockdown will last, however, with some reports suggesting that the number of cases could be reduced by as much as 30%.
However, the Prime Minister has indicated that he will not rule out the possibility of further restrictions on travel, saying that ""our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of those affected"".
On the same day, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that she would step down from her post as Chancellor of Germany, following the coronavirus crisis, and would take a leave of absence for the remainder of her term. She will be replaced by her brother, Georgie, in a move that will see her become the youngest person to hold the position in German history, having previously held the role of First Secretary of State between 1922 and 1944. Her brother is currently the head of state's emergency committee, which has the power to suspend state institutions and to order the closure of schools, hospitals and other public services.


So, is there any official reason why the government is asking people to stay at home, rather than going to the shops and restaurants? Or is it just a political decision, or are there some other factors that make it more likely that people will choose to go out and spend their time in isolated settings?   Or are they simply trying to make sure that they don't run out of things to worry about? I'm not sure what the official rationale is for this, but it seems to be a desire to keep the status quo and avoid any further disruption to public life, despite the fact that there are currently no official statistics available to support this view. I'd also like to know if there have been any cases where people have resorted to self-isolation or other measures to reduce their risk of infection, such as washing their hands with soap and water for 20 seconds, before going out to buy food or take care of their elderly relatives, to avoid further disruptions to their daily lives? If so, how does this compare to other European countries, where the situation is more chaotic and people are less likely to seek medical attention for any reason other than fear of being infected by a contagious disease? Also, does anyone have any insight into how this would work in practice, e.g. what would happen if someone went to a supermarket and bought a cup of tea, only to find it was too late to get any more than one cup at a time? Thanks in advance!
Edit:
I'm wondering if anyone has had any experience with this situation, i.e. if it's been successful in slowing down or preventing the spread of a disease, what other considerations would prevent it from spreading further? Is there anything I should be aware of that could prevent this from happening in some circumstances? Any advice would greatly be appreciated!

Thank you for your time and your answers! I hope this has been helpful for anyone who is concerned about what might happen to them if they go outside their normal daily routine and do not take any other precautions to protect themselves and others from potentially spreading the disease. In particular, if you have a fever, cough, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing, you may want to take some extra precautions, like covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you are not in direct contact with anyone else. If you feel unwell and are worried about going outside, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol and 20% water to disinfect your hands and feet, especially your eyes, nose and mouth. Avoid touching your face, hands or face coverings with a cloth or plastic bag or sleeve. Wear a mask and carry a medical mask with you whenever you go to and from work, school, public transport or public health facilities, including pharmacies and pharmacies. Follow the directions of your local health authority and local authorities on how to maintain social distancing and regular hand hygiene during public gatherings and in public settings. Do not leave your home unless absolutely necessary, except in extreme cases of extreme heat, heat and/or heat-related illness. Keep up to date on the latest local and national news, visas and public health advice from the relevant authorities"
" Yes, but it’s not as simple as washing your hands with soap and water. 

According to the CDC, people can get COVID-19 by touching their eyes, nose, mouth, or mouth with their hands or using a tissue or tissue from their mouth or nose. The virus can also be transmitted through small droplets from someone who is coughing or sneezing, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised that people wear disposable gloves when handling food and other personal items, such as utensils, as well as hand sanitizer and hand hygiene products. [See also: How to protect yourself](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/health/coronavirus-handwashing-tips.html) and use a disposable mask if you are sick.
 But there are some things you can do to avoid touching your face, including:


Cover your mouth and nose with the back of your hand, then wrap it around your elbow or elbow. Then, use an alcohol-based hand rub or soap to wipe the surface of the contact lens or lens before and after touching the food or beverage. If you have a fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of local health authorities and local public health officials for any restrictions on travel, movement or public gatherings. Avoid close contact with people who are ill and stay home if at least one person with you is ill or has a history of respiratory symptoms. For more information about how your health and safety are being managed, visit the CDC website, Tips for Public Health Professionals and State and Local Organizations on how to stay healthy and prevent the spread of illness. Learn more about how to protect yourself and protect the health of others by following the advice of a qualified health care provider. CDC is working with state, local, tribal and territorial health departments to develop strategies and guidance for people living with HIV and those with other health conditions to reduce the risk of transmission and improve access to essential services and services.

" The most common type of COVID-19 diagnosis is asymptomatic, meaning that they have no symptoms at all. However, some patients may have mild symptoms, such as fever, shortness of breath, and/or a dry cough. These patients are referred to emergency department (ED) units, where they are cared for by a physician or other health care provider.

In most cases, the primary care physician will be in the patient’s immediate family member (parent, child, or carer), and the ED will provide care to patients who are otherwise in stable or non-persistent health conditions.  If a patient is in a tertiary care setting, they may be placed in an intensive care unit (ICU) or a ventilator (VMO).  In addition, patients in ICU settings may need to be hospitalized with supportive care measures (e.g., respiratory masks, masks with Velcro closure, etc.), and in some cases may require special care due to underlying medical conditions, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (AQS), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ARDS), or coronavirus disease (CVD). In some settings, there may also be a need for specialized care in cases of severe illness. For example, in China, for instance, at least one patient in Wuhan, Hubei Province, died after contracting the virus, but no other cases have been reported. In the United States, more than 1,200 patients have died from the disease so far this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
